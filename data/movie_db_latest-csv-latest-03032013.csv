1693,(500) Days of Summer,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel star in director Marc Webb's wry, nonlinear romantic comedy about a man who falls head over heels for a woman who doesn't believe in love. Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is an aspiring architect who currently earns his living as a greeting card writer. Upon encountering his boss' beautiful new secretary, Summer (Deschanel), Tom discovers that the pair have plenty in common despite the fact that she's seemingly out of his league; for starters, they both love the Smiths, and they're both fans of surrealist artist Magritte. Before long Tom is smitten. All he can think about is Summer. Tom believes deeply in the concept of soul mates, and he's finally found his. Unfortunately for Tom, Summer sees true love as the stuff of fairy tales, and isn't looking for romance. Undaunted and undeterred by his breezy lover's casual stance on relationships, Tom summons all of his might and courage to pursue Summer and convince her that their love is real. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","The film is presented in a nonlinear narrative, as it jumps from various days within the 500-day span of Tom and Summer's relationship, indicated by an animation that includes the day's number; this summary is a linear version of the events of the film.
On January 8, Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon Levitt) meets Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel), the new assistant to his boss. Tom trained as an architect but works as a writer at a greeting card company in Los Angeles. Following a karaoke night, Tom's friend and co-worker McKenzie (Geoffrey Arend) reveals that Tom is attracted to Summer. During the next few months Summer and Tom grow closer, despite Summer's telling Tom that she does not believe in true love, and does not want a boyfriend.
Tom shows Summer his favorite spot in the city, which overlooks a number of buildings he likes, although the view is spoiled by parking lots. After several months of dating, Tom gets into a fight with a man who flirts with Summer, and they have their first argument. On day 290, Summer and Tom end their relationship after they see The Graduate, a film which Tom thinks shows true love. Tom does not take the breakup well, and Tom's friends call his younger sister, Rachel, to calm him down.
Summer quits her job at the greeting card company. Tom's boss moves him to the consolations department, as his depression is not suitable for happier events. Months later, as Summer and Tom attend the wedding of a co-worker, they dance at the wedding and Summer catches the bouquet. They sit next to each other on the trip home, and Summer invites Tom to a party at her apartment. He attends the party, but leaves when he sees that Summer is wearing an engagement ring. Tom enters a deep depression, only leaving his apartment for alcohol and junk food. After a few days, he returns to work with a hangover and after an emotional outburst, quits his job. He decides to rededicate himself to architecture, makes a list of firms, and begins to attend interviews.
On day 488, Summer sees Tom at his favorite spot in the city, and they talk. Tom states his lack of understanding towards her actions. Summer explains that he was right about the existence of true love and that she discovered in someone else all the feelings she had never been sure about with Tom. Summer holds Tom's hand. She says she is glad to see Tom is doing well. As she leaves Tom tells her he really hopes she is happy.
Twelve days later, on Wednesday, May 23, he attends a job interview and meets a beautiful girl who is also applying for the same job. They talk, and Tom learns she shares his favorite spot and dislike for the parking lots. Before entering the interview, he makes a date to have coffee with her afterwards. He asks her name, and she replies ""Autumn"".","the beatles,spontaneous,bench, why make something disposable like a building when you can make something that lasts forever,henry miller,engagement ring,greeting card,architecture,love at first sight,bicycle,fate,break up,love,ringo starr,autumn, like a greeting card,friendship,buildings,copy machine,school yearbook,anticipation,talking to mirror,video,frustration,karaoke,barcelona chair,apology,quitting a job,depression,500,architect,exciting,time lapse photography,anger,true love,loneliness is underrated,origami,mime,surprise,friend,ikea,ingmar bergman,sadness,expectation,joy,barvcelona chair,breakup,job interview,pms,tourette,photography,drawing,architect office,park bench,despair,sketch,office romance,jealousy,video store,girlfriend,co worker,coincidence,serendipity,heartache,relationship,boyfriend,time lapse,summer,unrequited love",1693.jpg,2009-07-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/500-days-of-summer/id329619072?uo=4,PsD0NpFSADM,,,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"
7310,127 Hours,"James Franco stars in director Danny Boyle's inspiring survival drama based on the incredible true story of Aron Ralston, who became trapped alone in a Utah canyon for days after slipping on a loose rock, and resorted to extraordinary measures in order to make it out of his dire predicament alive. An experienced hiker and climber, Ralston (Franco) is very much in his element when he parks his truck by a mountain near Moab, UT, hops on his bike, and peddles to the middle of nowhere. Later, when Ralston encounters a pair of young female hikers who have gotten lost while searching for a local landmark, he jovially shows them a sight that most casual hikers miss before bidding them farewell and continuing on his way. Drifting through the canyons alone, deep in thought, however, the explorer who presumed he was ready for anything quickly discovers just how fast things can spin out of control when a rock gives way as he shimmies down a crevice, and pins his hand to the unforgiving wall of stone. Over the course of the next 127 hours, Ralston tries everything he can think of to free himself, flashing back to small but memorable events in his life -- as well as forward to the future that he might enjoy should he manage to wiggle free -- as his body begins the slow process of shutting down. Eventually realizing that the only way out is to leave part of himself behind, the exhausted, delirious adventurer draws his cheap made-in-China multi-tool, and does what it takes to survive. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","On Friday, April 25, 2003, Aron Ralston (James Franco) prepares for a day of canyoneering in Utah's Canyonlands National Park as he drives to the trailhead at night. The next morning he rides through the park on his mountain bike, aiming to cut 45 minutes off the guide book's estimate for the time needed to reach his destination. He is on foot, running along a bare rock formation when he sees two hikers, Kristi (Kate Mara) and Megan (Amber Tamblyn), apparently lost. Ralston convinces the pair that he is a trail guide and offers to show them a much more interesting route than the one they had been trying to find. He leads them through Robbers Roost area narrow canyons, including a blind jump into an underground pool, where the three film themselves repeating the plunge using Ralston's video camera. As they part company, Kristi and Megan invite Ralston to a party they're holding the next night, and he promises to attend. However, they doubt he will show up.
Ralston continues into Blue John Canyon, through a narrow passage where boulders are suspended, wedged between the walls of rock. As he descends, one boulder is jarred loose, falling after Ralston to the bottom of the canyon and smashing his right arm against the canyon wall, trapping him. He initially yells for help, but the extreme isolation of his location means that nobody is within earshot. As he resigns himself to the fact that he is on his own, he begins recording a video diary on his camera and using the larger blade on his pocket multi-tool to attempt to chip away at the boulder. He also begins rationing his water and food.
As he realizes his efforts to chip away at the boulder are futile, he begins to attempt to cut into his arm, but finds his knife too blunt to break his skin. He then stabs his arm, but realizes he will not be able to cut through the bone. He finds himself out of water and is forced to drink his own urine. His video logs become more and more desperate as he feels himself dying. He begins dreaming about relationships and past experiences, including a former lover (Clémence Poésy), family (Lizzy Caplan, Treat Williams, Kate Burton), and the two hikers he met before his accident. After reflecting upon his life, he comes to the realization that everything he has done has led him to this ordeal, and that he was destined to die alone in the canyon.
After five days, Ralston sees a vision of a little boy, which he assumes is his unborn son, a blond boy of about 3 (Peter Joshua Hull), through a premonition. He discovers that by using his knowledge of torque and applying enough force to his forearm, he can break the radius and then the ulna bones. He gathers the will to do so and eventually severs his arm with the smaller, less dull knife on the multi-tool. He fashions a crude tourniquet out of the insulation for his CamelBak tube and uses a carabiner to tighten it. Aron frees himself on Thursday, May 1, 2003 at 11:34 A.M. Mountain Standard Time. He wraps the stump of his arm and takes a picture of the boulder that trapped him as he leaves it behind. He then makes his way out of the canyon, where he is forced to rappel down a 65-foot rockface and hike several miles before, exhausted and covered in blood, he finally runs into a family on a day hike. The family sends for help and Ralston is evacuated by a Utah Highway Patrol helicopter.
The film ends with shots of Ralston from his life after his ordeal — including several of Ralston's further adventures in climbing and mountaineering, which he continued following the accident — and of the real Aron Ralston with his wife, Jessica, whom he met three years later, and their son, Leo, born in 2010. A title card that appears before the closing credits says that Ralston now always leaves a note whenever he goes anywhere alone.","amputee,will to live,penknife,come together,rock,cut it,wait,echo,minute i was born,why make something disposable like a building when you can make something that lasts forever,hack,entire life, right here. i've been moving towards it my entire life. the minute i was born,mobile phone,choose,alone, acceptance,waiting,powerful force,there is no force more powerful than the will to live,powerful, to come here. right,saw,loneliness is underrated,survival, every breath i've taken,rolling stone,rock and a hard place,every breath,god,lost,choice, every action has been leading me to this crack on the earth's surface,oscars nominee,meteorite,million years,rock and hard place,decision,billion years, every breath i take,stuck,like a greeting card,stranded, billion years ago up there in space. it's been waiting,long wait,swiss army knife,right here right now,oscars,cut, ever since it was a bit of meteorite a million, everything is... just comes together. it's me. i chose this. i chose all of this. this rock... this rock has been waiting for me my entire life. in its entire life",7310.jpg,2011-01-07,,OlhLOWTnVoQ,70141813,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/127_Hours/70141813,Drama
7301,13 Assassins,,"Takashi Miike goes six better than Seven Samurai.  Impressively restrained by his standards, but still the year's best film to feature a burning cow.

A notable change of gears for the usually unpredictable Miike, as he's followed this with another old-school samurai movie, his remake of 1960s classic Harakiri. A man of many talents, most of them to do with genius cinema violence, Takashi Miike (Audition) returns with a devoutly classical, if not exactly classic, remake of a 1963 period samurai film. 

After assembling his (not so) dirty dozen, Koji Yakusho ambushes an evil lord’s army, despite being suicidal outnumbered. 

All politics and posturing, the first two-thirds of the film are stiff and uninvolving, and although the climatic 45-minute free-for-all is genuinely spectacular, it’s clear where the director’s heart lies.

Living like teenagers again, they slip back into their adolescent selves and risk the case and their friendship - with hysterically disastrous results! Jonah Hill, Channing Tatum and Ice Cube star in this outrageously hilarious action-comedy!","Morton Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Greg Jenko (Channing Tatum) are former classmates who meet again at police academy. Schmidt was a chubby nerd obsessed with Eminem while Jenko was an underachieving jock. They end up becoming best friends at the academy as they help with each others' weaknesses, with Schmidt helping Jenko study and Jenko motivating Schmidt through physical activity. They graduate together as partners, but are assigned to park patrol. They catch a break when they spot a group of One Percenters and arrest their leader Domingo (DeRay Davis). The department is forced to release him as Jenko forgot the wording of the Miranda rights. The two are reassigned to a revived specialty division on 21 Jump Street.
They are introduced to Captain Dickson (Ice Cube), who explains the division specializes in infiltrating high schools and that they were chosen because of their youthful appearances. Schmidt and Jenko are assigned to stop a new synthetic drug that caused a teenage boy to overdose by finding the supplier. They go undercover as brothers, living at Schmidt's parents' house. Jenko accidentally switches their identities and they get each other's classes. They learn the lead dealer of the drug is the leader of the popular crowd Eric (Dave Franco), but he is not the supplier.
They go to the dealing room where Eric forces them to take the drug there and not wait. They attempt to regurgitate it but are unsuccessful, and they undergo the phases of the drug while talking to their P.E. teacher, Mr. Walters (Rob Riggle), and also while running track and during band practice. The mistakes that happen at the track meet cause Eric to take a liking to Schmidt.
Schmidt manages to fit in with the popular kids and takes a romantic interest in Eric's friend Molly (Brie Larson), while Jenko becomes friends with the nerds in his AP Chemistry class while his teacher Ms. Griggs (Ellie Kemper) takes a sexual interest in him. Jenko discovers that his new friends secretly tap into other people's cell phones to listen into their conversations. Schmidt decides to throw a party at his house to gain Eric's complete trust and Jenko takes the opportunity to tap into Eric's phone. Despite Captain Dickson ordering them not to serve alcohol and drugs to minors, they nevertheless buy alcohol and steal confiscated marijuana. When Eric arrives with Molly and his other friends, Jenko steals Eric's phone for his friends to tap into while Schmidt fights off a rival on Eric's.
Schmidt pretends to sell the drug for Eric but is actually giving it to Captain Dickson to be confiscated. While at Eric's house, Schmidt asks Molly out to prom while Jenko listens through Eric's phone. He also insults Jenko to Eric with Jenko listening. Schmidt and Jenko learn that Eric is making a deal soon. When Jenko spots Eric leaving school, he takes Schmidt to follow him. They see that Eric is dealing with the One Percenters and they follow them, but are forced to run away when Domingo spots them. Back at school, Jenko accuses Schmidt of his earlier insults, possibly ruining the case, and getting in too deep, but Schmidt brushes him off. Jenko and Schmidt get into a fight that results in Molly not liking Schmidt, Schmidt and Jenko getting expelled and fired from Jump Street.
Later that night, both are confronted by Eric and his friends, who want to bring them on as security after hearing about what happened with the One Percenters. He tells them about a deal happening during prom where they get to meet the supplier. At prom, they are surprised to see that the supplier is Mr. Walters. The One Percenters arrive for the deal, and Domingo recognizes Schmidt and Jenko as police officers, and tells two of his men to kill them. However, the two men reveal themselves as DEA Agents Tom Hanson (Johnny Depp) and Doug Penhall (Peter DeLuise), who were a part of the Jump Street program when it began. Hanson casually talks to Schmidt and Jenko during the standoff which gives Domingo the opportunity to kill Hanson and Penhall. A gunfight ensues among Schmidt and Jenko, Mr. Walters, and the One Percenters. Mr. Walters and Eric escape in a limo with a drug-influenced Molly as a hostage, with the One Percenters in pursuit of them in another limo. Schmidt and Jenko pursue all of them in another limo where Jenko creates a homemade chemical bomb from his knowledge in AP Chemistry to kill the One Percenters. They then confront Mr. Walters, who shoots at Schmidt. Jenko jumps in front of Schmidt, saving his life and getting shot in the arm and his chest, which was protected by a bullet-proof vest, in the process. In response, Schmidt shoots Mr. Walters in the groin, severing his penis. The duo successfully arrest him and Jenko and Schmidt make amends with each other. Schmidt makes amends with Molly and the two share a kiss. They are rehired into Jump Street where Dickson gives them a new assignment in a college setting, to Schmidt's excitement but to Jenko's dismay.","school play,police captain,fight,stealing a car,party,childhood photo,false identity,drug overdose,prostitute,police arrest,police station,geek,shot in the crotch,church,drug supplier,white tuxedo,fake nose,insecurity,police academy,high school play,drug induced hallucination,deception,chores,hostage,jock,chemistry class,joy,hallucination,house party,kicked in the crotch,street in title,digit in title,underage drinking,drama class,year 2012,punched in the stomach,father son relationship,high school teacher,underachiever,cell phone,punched in the face,gay teenager, high school,address as title,drug dealer,flashback,limousine,scene during end credits,car chase,prom,18 year old,pistol,shot in the throat,year 2005,narcotics,male rear nudity,hit by car,high school senior,marijuana joint,role reversal,biker gang,motorcycle crash,disguise,parody,burnt body,police,friendship,severed penis,shootout,partnership,text messaging,montage,drunkenness,one percenter,dove,remake,character repeating someone else's dialogue,reference to twitter,threesome,555 phone number,mother son relationship,undercover cop,arrest,reference to peter pan,teacher student relationship,poem,f word,popularity,drug,exploding car,eavesdropping,high school principal,penthouse,party drug,environmentalism,police misconduct,pinata,wilhelm scream,shot in the chest",3754.jpg,2012-03-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/21-jump-street/id518877094?uo=4,uh3GiJZVats,70208247,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/21_Jump_Street/70208247,"Action & Adventure,Comedy"

7172,42,,"The life story of Jackie Robinson and his history-making signing with the Brooklyn Dodgers under the guidance of team executive Branch Rickey. Hero is a word we hear often in sports, but heroism is not always about achievements on the field of play. ""42"" tells the story of two men-the great Jackie Robinson and legendary Brooklyn Dodgers GM Branch Rickey-whose brave stand against prejudice forever changed the world by changing the game of baseball. In 1946, Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford) put himself at the forefront of history when he signed Jackie Robinson (Chadwick Boseman) to the team, breaking Major League Baseball's infamous color line. But the deal also put both Robinson and Rickey in the firing line of the public, the press and even other players. Facing unabashed racism from every side, Robinson was forced to demonstrate tremendous courage and restraint by not reacting in kind, knowing that any incident could destroy his and Rickey's hopes. Instead, Number 42 let his talent on the field do the talking-ultimately winning over fans and his teammates, silencing his critics, and paving the way for others to follow.

3222,42nd Street,"When the leading lady of a Broadway musical breaks her ankle, she is replaced by a young unknown actress, who becomes the star of the show.","It is 1932, during the early days of the Depression, and Broadway producers Jones (Robert McWade) and Barry (Ned Sparks) put on Pretty Lady, a musical starring beautiful Dorothy Brock (Bebe Daniels). Brock is involved with industrialist Abner Dillon (Guy Kibbee), who is the show's ""angel"" (financial backer). But while she is busy keeping Dillon both hooked and at arm's length, she still secretly meets her old vaudeville partner and lover, the out-of-work Pat Denning (George Brent).
To ensure success Julian Marsh (Warner Baxter), who is the best, is hired to direct. But Marsh is ill, destitute, friendless, and bitter as a result of the 1929 Stock Market Crash. ""Did you ever try to cash a reputation in a bank?"" he asks the producers who are surprised to hear his desperation. Gambling with health and life, Marsh must make his last show a major hit and financial success if he is to have enough money to retire on. ""This time I'm going to sock it away so hard you'll have to blast to get it out"" he says after signing up to direct, referring to his financial situation.
Cast selection and rehearsals begin amidst fierce competition, with not a few ""casting couch"" innuendos flying around. Na‚àö√òve newcomer Peggy Sawyer (Ruby Keeler), who arrives in New York from her home in Allentown, Pennsylvania, is duped and ignored until two chorines, Lorraine Fleming (Una Merkel) and Ann ""Anytime Annie"" Lowell (Ginger Rogers), take her under their wing. Lorraine has an ""in"" with dance director Andy Lee (George E. Stone), while the show's juvenile lead Billy Lawler (Dick Powell) takes a liking to Peggy and puts in a good word for her with Marsh.
Rehearsals continue for five weeks to Marsh's complete dissatisfaction, until the night before the opening in Philadelphia when Brock fractures her ankle. Next morning Abner Dillon wants Marsh to cast his new interest, Annie Lowell, as the star. Annie decides she is not talented enough but tells Marsh that the untried, green, Peggy Sawyer is.
With 200 jobs and his own financial and personal future riding on the outcome, Marsh rehearses Sawyer mercilessly (vowing ""I'll either have a live leading lady or a dead chorus girl"") until an hour before curtain time on the night of the premiere Brock, soon to be married to Pat, arrives and wishes Peggy luck, and the show is on. Nearly twenty minutes are devoted to three Busby Berkeley production numbers: Shuffle Off to Buffalo, Keep Young and Healthy, and the title song 42nd Street. The show is a success, and in the final scene Marsh turns wearily away from the brightly lit theatre entrance and slumps down on a fire escape as theatre-goers depart praising the musical.[2]
In the original Bradford Ropes novel, Julian Marsh and Billy Lawler are lovers. Since this sort of relationship was deemed unacceptable to audiences of the era, a romance was created for Billy and Peggy.","witty,humorous,feel good,joy",3222.jpg,1933-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/42nd-street/id284412661?uo=4,f2OaJv0NBB8,70046650,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/42nd_Street/70046650,Musical & Performing Arts

2974,50 First Dates,"Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore star together for the first time since The Wedding Singer in one of the funniest romantic comedies in years. Henry (Sandler) lives an enviable life in a Hawaiian paradise, spending every night with a beautiful tourist in search of an island fling. It's a sweet life with no strings attached...until he meets Lucy (Barrymore). He and Lucy hit it off from the get-go, but the next day she acts like she doesn't know him. Has his karma come around to kick him in the butt or what? Actually, Lucy has short-term memory loss so every night all memory of her day is erased. But a man in love will go to any lengths to win over the girl of his dreams, and if that means having to find imaginative ways of doing it over again every day, then Henry's up for the challenge. Rob Schneider (Big Daddy) and Sean Astin (The Lord of the Rings trilogy) co-star in 50 First Dates, which will win you over every time you watch it!","Henry Roth is a veterinarian at Sea Life Park on the island of Oahu who has a reputation of womanizing female tourists. He shows no interest in committing to a serious relationship and his closest friends are Ula, a marijuana-smoking Islander; his assistant Alexa, whose sexuality and gender is unclear; and Willy, his pet African penguin.
One day Henry’s boat The Sea Serpent, breaks down while he is sailing around Oahu. He goes to the Hukilau Café to wait for the coastguard. There, he sees a pretty young woman named Lucy Whitmore, who makes architectural art with her waffles. Henry assumes she is a local, which prevents him from introducing himself, but the next day he comes back. Lucy and he hit if off instantly and she asks him to meet her again tomorrow morning.
However, when Henry goes back to the café, Lucy shows no recollection of ever meeting him. The restaurant owner Sue (Amy Hill) explains to Henry that a year ago, Lucy and her father Marlin went up to the North Shore to pick a pineapple for his birthday. On the way back, they got into a serious car accident that left Lucy with Goldfield Syndrome, a type of anterograde amnesia. She wakes up every morning thinking it is Sunday, October 13 of the last year. To save her the heartbreak of reliving the accident everyday, Marlin and Doug, Lucy’s lisping steroid-addicted brother, relive Marlin's birthday by doing numerous tasks, including putting out October 13th's newspaper, watching the same Vikings game, and refilling Lucy’s shampoo bottles.
Despite Sue’s warning, Henry decided to try and get Lucy to have breakfast with him. Eventually he does, but it ends poorly when Henry accidentally hurts Lucy’s feelings. He follows her home to apologize where Marlin and Doug instruct Henry to leave Lucy alone. Henry begins concocting ways to run into Lucy through the following days such as pretending to have car trouble, creating a fake road block and by having Ula beat him up. Eventually, Marlin and Doug figure this out due to Lucy singing The Beach Boys ""Wouldn't It Be Nice"" on the days when she meets Henry.
One day, as Henry is about to sit with Lucy at breakfast, she notices a police officer writing her a ticket for her expired plates. Lucy attempts to argue that they are not yet expired, and takes a newspaper to prove herself, but sees that the date on all the newspapers is not October as she thought, and Marlin and Doug are forced to admit their ruse when she confronts them.
Henry comes up with an idea to make a video explaining to Lucy her accident and their relationship and play it every morning for her. She watched the tape and is hurt, but eventually comes to her senses and she is able to spend the day by picking up where the tape says she left off. She spends more time with Henry and goes to see some of her old friends. Lucy decides to erase Henry completely from her life after learning of his decision to not take a sailing trip to Bristol Bay to study walruses, something that has been in planning mode for the past 10 years. He feels he cannot leave Lucy for the year it will take him. Henry reluctantly helps her destroy her journal entries of their relationship.
A few weeks later, Henry is preparing to leave for his sailing trip. Before he goes, Marlin tells him that Lucy is now living at the brain institute and teaching an art class. He also tells him that she sings. Then, he gives Henry a Beach Boys CD. Listening to the CD, Henry becomes emotional and curses Marlin for giving him the CD and making him feel so emotional. He then remembers that Marlin once told him that Lucy always sings after she meets him. He then realizes that Lucy remembers him and turns around to go home. She says she does not remember, but that she dreams about him every night and paints pictures of him. They reconcile.
Some time later, Lucy wakes up and plays the tape marked “Good Morning Lucy”. It again reminds her of her accident, but ends with her and Henry’s wedding. From the tape, Henry says to put a jacket on and come have breakfast when she is ready. Lucy then sees that she is on Henry’s boat, which finally made it to Alaska. She goes up on deck and meets Marlin, Henry and their young daughter, Nicole.","cannabis,clinic,fantasy sequence,beach,animal vomit,memory loss,wager,diner,break up,doctor,empathy,love,kiss,nipples,waffles,metrosexual,daydream,penguin,father daughter relationship,walrus,veterinarian,dishwasher,video,dolphin,videotape,dream,reference to j. edgar hoover,deception,unexpectedly,obscene finger gesture,true love,vomit,beach party,aquarium,car accident,stitch,teacher,surprise,sex,stiches,masturbation,joy,steroids,restaurant,short term memory loss,journal,father son relationship,womanizer,wet dream,truth,boat accident,golf,pancakes,painting,hawaii,flashback,sentimental,couples fight,trust,humorous,baseball bat,shark,boat,sailboat,memory,androgyny,amnesia,playing with food,emotional,pretend,feel good,pineapple",2974.jpg,2004-02-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/50-first-dates/id280360127?uo=4,ErjP5xMTc8I,60033311,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/50_First_Dates/60033311,Comedy

Jimmy Smith (Eminem), known to his friends as Rabbit, is a young man trying to make his way out of the burned-out shell of inner-city Detroit. Rabbit's entire life has been a hard climb, and it certainly hasn't gotten any easier lately; Rabbit has just been dumped by his girlfriend, forcing him to move back in with his emotionally unstable mother, Stephanie (Kim Basinger), and he's getting along especially poorly with Stephanie's new boyfriend. Rabbit has a factory job that's tough, demeaning, and doesn't pay especially well, and he's convinced his skills as a rapper are his only real hope at a better life. Rabbit makes music with a crew of DJ's and MC's who call themselves Three One Third, among them his close friend Future (Mekhi Phifer), but his status as a white kid making music in a predominantly African-American community and culture is extremely intimidating, and after Rabbit freezes up in the midst of an MC battle, he's convinced he's missed his chance and that he's doomed to lead a marginal life as a factory rat for the rest of his days. With the help of his friends, and his new girlfriend Alex (Brittany Murphy), Rabbit struggles to work up the courage and the confidence to take one more shot at making his dream a reality. 8 Mile was shot on location in Detroit; the name refers to 8 Mile Road, a thoroughfare along the city's perimeter which effectively separates the middle-class suburban neighborhoods from the lower-class inner-city.

Tension between the two brothers comes to a head when their father is murdered after a crime deal goes sour and Tse-ho lands in jail after being double-crossed.

As Mark tries to shoot his way out of the restaurant, pulling a series of hidden pistols from potted plants and alcoves, he gets horribly injured. With both founding members of the counterfeiting syndicate incapacitated, the operation falls into the hands of Shing (Waise Lee Chi-hung), Tse-ho's former underling who has little of his boss' elan or experience. When Tse-ho gets out of jail, he reunites with his now-crippled comrade, Mark, to take out Shing and to protect Tse-kit whose life is in danger for investigating their former subordinate. ~ Jonathan Crow, Rovi","photograph,slow motion explosion,fight,threat,shot in the arm,brutal violence,climbing through a window,garbage,toothpick,slow motion death scene,bullet ballet,cripple,danger,stabbed in the back,tragic male character,suicide by cop,falling down stairs,black humor,brutality,slow motion fighting scene,tragic event,police station,blood squib,uncertainty principle,cigar smoking,bloodshed,affection,mob,death,blood,sunglasses,gruesome,target practice,gruesome violence,first of series,bloody violence,ultra slow motion,heroic bloodshed,surprise,hospital,criminal syndicate,taxi,triad,flower pot,handcuffs,blood gushing,forgiveness,cello case,duster,exploding building,betrayal,bloodbath,father son relationship,telling a joke,career change,splatter action,blood spurting,punched in the face,brother brother relationship,violence,taiwan,trust,wrath,broken leg,bodyguard,slow motion violence,pistol,weapon,slow motion shootout,praying,social worker,passing an exam,gun duel,shooting,hong kong,action violence,tragedy,parking meter,surgery,cult male character,friendship,power outage,grisly violence,mob boss,slow motion carnage,mafia,sadism,kung fu,knife in the chest,first part,massacre,sadist,anger,graphic violence,character repeating someone else's dialogue,part of trilogy,self sacrifice,police officer,birthday,sadness,gun violence,queen mary the ocean liner,gun fu,extreme brutality,shot in the head,bitterness,traitor,restaurant shoot out,grisly shootout,counterfeit money,slow motion blood splatter,breaking a mirror,blood splatter,law,cellist,held at gunpoint,flashback within a flashback,destiny,black comedy,english subtitles in original,shot in the back,shot in the face,shot in the side,boardroom,birthday present,cruelty,slow motion action scene,gangster,blood spatter,first of trilogy,counterfeiting,death of father,barbed wire,bandage over eye,carnage,taxi driver,criminal,shot in the leg,shotgun,vengeance,loyalty,cult film,andy warhol,knife,death of friend,mexican standoff,gun battle,false money,male bonding,blood on shirt,gore,ex convict,slow motion scene,brother betrays brother,newspaper,strong graphic violence,broken arm,shame,false accusation,strong violence,million dollars,suitcase of money,working class,gun kata,police training,police superintendent,self respect,gun sau,punched in the stomach,judge,burning money,apprentice,money,dual wield,telephone booth,cello,parking garage,taipei,crying,cut hand,gun,prison,machine gun,shot to death,detective,birthday cake,remorse,counterfeit,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,police,combat,extreme violence,shootout,anticipation,errand boy,murder,stabbed in the chest,trap,exciting,drinking urine,knocked out,children's choir,bare chested male,beating,fighting,blowing out a candle,shot in the shoulder,extreme blood,friend,revenge,incense,gunfight,five hundred dollar bill,slow motion diving,father,scheming wife,traffic jam,bandaged head,motorcycle,extreme brutal violence,counterfeiting operation,exit wound,looking at self in mirror,stabbing,blood and gore,car crash,fist fight,organized crime,beaten to death,bullet time,unlikely hero,menace,mercilessness,partner in crime,shot in the chest,crippled",3304.jpg,2010-09-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/a-better-tomorrow/id473205596?uo=4,,,,"Action & Adventure,Art House & International,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Drawn from true-life events, A Dangerous Method takes a glimpse into the turbulent relationships between fledgling psychiatrist Carl Jung, his mentor Sigmund Freud and Sabina Spielrein, the troubled but beautiful young woman who comes between them. Into the mix comes Otto Gross, a debauched patient who is determined to push the boundaries. In this exploration of sensuality, ambition and deceit set the scene for the pivotal moment when Jung, Freud and Sabina come together and split apart, forever changing the face of modern thought.","Seduced by the challenge of an impossible case, the driven Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) takes the unbalanced yet beautiful Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) as his patient in A Dangerous Method.

2386,A Fish Called Wanda,"In London, four very different people team up to commit armed robbery, then try to doublecross each other for the loot. Sexy American diamonds lover Wanda and her boyfriend Otto are in England to plot alongside George and Ken the robbery of a diamond collection. Wanda and Otto want the stolen diamonds for themselves, and inform the police about George not knowing that he has already moved the diamonds to another secret place. Wanda thinks the best way to find out is by getting close to George's lawyer - Archie Leach.","London-based gangster George Thomason (Tom Georgeson) and his right-hand man, Ken Pile (Michael Palin), a beleaguered animal lover with a bad stutter, plan a jewel heist. They bring in two Americans to help: an alluring con artist, Wanda Gershwitz (Jamie Lee Curtis) and their ""weapons man"" Otto West (Kevin Kline), an Anglophobe who fancies himself as an intellectual. Wanda and Otto are lovers, but hide this fact from George and Ken, pretending to be brother and sister, so Wanda can work her charms on them.
The robbery goes well, with the thieves getting away with a large sum in diamonds. The only problem is that they are briefly spotted during their getaway by an old lady walking her dogs. The group then hide the loot in a safe in an old warehouse. Soon after, Wanda and Otto betray George to the police and he is arrested. They return to collect the loot, only to find that George and Ken have moved it to an unknown location. Wanda, who was planning to double-cross Otto as well, decides to seduce George's unhappily married lawyer, Archie Leach (John Cleese), who must endure a vindictive wife and a spoiled daughter, to find out where the diamonds are located. Otto becomes insanely jealous, and his interference, combined with incidences of bad luck, lead Wanda and Archie's liaisons to go disastrously wrong. Archie eventually calls off their attempted affair.
Meanwhile, George gives Ken the task of killing the old lady, the Crown's only eye witness. During his various attempts to kill her, the animal-loving Ken accidentally kills off her three Yorkshire Terriers one by one. This causes him grief, as well as grave bodily harm as each attempt goes wrong. However, the witness suffers a fatal heart attack when her last Terrier is killed, and Ken is ultimately successful in his mission.
Wanda and Otto want George to remain in jail, but with no witness he may get off. During the course of George's trial, Wanda gives evidence that will lead to a conviction rather than an acquittal. Archie, stunned by the unexpected turn in her evidence, flubs his cross-examination and inadvertently calls her ""darling"". Enraged, George starts a brawl that leads to everyone fleeing the courtroom. Archie's wife Wendy (Maria Aitken) is sitting in the observer's area, and Archie's antics confirm her suspicions of his affair (though it has never been consummated). After George is taken into custody, she confronts Archie and states that she plans to divorce him. With his career ruined and his marriage about to end, Archie resolves to cut his losses, find the loot, and flee with Wanda to South America. Promised less jail time, George tells Archie that Ken knows the location of the diamonds. As he is leaving to question Ken, Archie picks up Wanda while she attempts to flee the courthouse. Archie tells her he knows that Ken is aware of the hiding spot, and Wanda counters by noting she has the key to the safe deposit box.
While the courtroom drama is unfolding, Otto has been trying to get Ken to reveal the location of the diamonds. He tortures Ken by eating the fish in his aquarium one-by-one, leaving the fish called Wanda until the end. In the process, Ken accidentally mentions the location of the diamonds at a hotel near Heathrow Airport. Otto is leaving just as Archie runs into the building; Otto steals Archie's car, taking Wanda with him. Ken tells Archie, as quickly as he can given his stutter, where they are going. The two give chase.
The protagonists all end up in Heathrow. Otto and Wanda recover the diamonds, but Wanda quickly double-crosses Otto and locks him in a cupboard. Otto escapes and is briefly captured by Archie, only to turn the tables. He is about to kill Archie, but Archie manages to distract Otto by pointing out that Americans are not always winners - as shown by their loss to North Vietnam in the Vietnam war. While they are arguing, Otto is run over by a steamroller driven by Ken, seeking vengeance for the live fish Otto ate. Archie joins Wanda on board the plane, which taxis for takeoff. Through the plane window, Otto, who has survived the steamroller attack, curses them until, as the plane takes off, he finally drops off.","disgust,exciting,barrister

2756,A Good Year,"Oscar-winner Russell Crowe reunites with Gladiator director Ridley Scott in A Good Year, a Fox 2000 Pictures presentation.  Max Skinner (Russell Crowe) is a highly successful investment expert with no time for life outside work. When his estranged uncle dies, Max inherits the vineyard in France where he grew up as a child, and his first intention is to sell the vineyard as quickly as possible.  But after spending unexpected time at the Vineyard in France, he discovers a part of himself that he had lost and experiences romance and a blossoming new love affair with a beautiful French woman that changes his life forever.  A Good Year is based on the best-selling novel of the same name by Peter Mayle.","In the prologue, a young Max Skinner spends his childhood summer holidays learning to appreciate the finer things in life at his Uncle Henry's vineyard estate in Provence in southeastern France. Some 25 years later, Max is an unethical, aggressive, hard-working London-based investment trader. Following his uncle's death, Max is the sole beneficiary of the French property. He travels to Provence to prepare a quick sale. Shortly after arriving he knocks a local cafe owner, named Fanny Chenal, off her bicycle as a result of his careless driving. Subsequently, he discovers that his latest City financial stunt has landed him in hot water with the UK government and with his firm's directors, necessitating his return to London. To assist in his planned sale of the property, Max hurriedly snaps some photos and in the process falls into an empty swimming pool. He is unable to escape until Fanny Chenal, driving by and spotting his rental car, appears and turns on the water supply in retaliation. This delay causes Max to miss his flight and having failed to report to the directors in person, he is suspended from work and trading activities for one week.
On Henry's estate, Max must deal with a gruff, dedicated winemaker, Francis Duflot, who fears being separated from his precious vines. Duflot pays a vineyard inspector to tell Max that the soil is bad and the vines worthless. In the meantime, they are surprised by the unexpected arrival of young Napa Valley oenophile Christie Roberts, who is backpacking through Europe and claims to be Henry's previously unknown illegitimate daughter. Max is concerned that she might lay claim to the estate. Worried about being usurped by Kenny, his second-in-command in London (through whom Max continues to direct trades), Max intentionally gives the ambitious young trader bad advice, which gets him fired.
Max becomes enamored with the beautiful, feisty caf‚àö¬© owner Fanny, who is rumored to have sworn off men. He successfully woos Fanny into his bed, where she leaves Max the next morning expecting him to return to his life in London. A disillusioned Christie also decides to move on and the estate is sold. Max returns to his life in London where Sir Nigel, the company chairman, offers Max a choice: ""Money or your life."" He must either choose a discharge settlement, which includes ""a lot of zeros,"" or accept the offer of a partnership in the trading firm, where he would then be ""made for life"".
Max chooses the money. He then cleverly invalidates the estate's contract of sale by forging a letter from Henry (as a child he signed cheques for his uncle, therefore being able to replicate his handwriting and signature) confirming that Christie is his daughter and also has a valid claim on the property. He puts his London residence up for sale and returns to Provence, entering into a relationship with Fanny. Christie also returns and she and Francis now jointly have to run the vineyard while trying to reconcile their vastly different philosophies of wine production. Meanwhile Max is now able to focus his entire attention on Fanny.","cousin cousin relationship,first kiss,sunburn,vineyard,wine drinking,red wine,joy,illegitimate child,chess,swimming pool,luberon,housekeeper,restaurant,cricket bat,wine tasting,grapes,bicycle accident,quite content,tennis,anticipation,waiter,stock market,wine,flashback,based on novel,sentimental,trust,female nudity,1980s,humorous,deceit,london england,inheritance,provence,stockbroker,emotional,touching,rose wine,self discovery,white wine,forgery,feel good,chateau,english,cafe owner,lawyer,uncle,marseille provence airport",2756.jpg,2006-09-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/a-good-year/id301244090?uo=4,LGmXc7zqr7g,,,"Comedy,Drama"

2492,A Life Less Ordinary,"Cameron Diaz and Ewan McGregor are star-crossed lovebirds on the lam in this twisted romantic comedy from the creators of Trainspotting. Celine (Diaz) is a spoiled, rich young woman whose worst nightmare is having her credit card rejected. Robert (McGregor) is a hapless janitor whose greatest dream is to write the Great American Trash Novel. They have nothing in common, except the burning desire to live ""a life less ordinary."" When Celine is kidnapped by the inept Robert, a pair of celestial cops are dispatched to earth to make sure they live that ""life less ordinary"" together. Co-starring Oscar -winner Holly Hunter and Delroy Lindo.","In Heaven (which resembles a modern police headquarters), angels are tasked with ensuring that humans on Earth find love. The ""Captain"", Gabriel (Dan Hedaya), is upset at reviewing the file of angel partners O'Reilly (Hunter) and Jackson (Lindo), all of whose recent cases have ended in divorce or misery. Gabriel is being pressed for results, so he introduces a radical new incentive: if their latest case isn't ""cracked"" - meaning, if the pair in question do not fall, and stay, in love, O'Reilly and Jackson must stay on Earth forever, not appealing to them. They open their case file, and see what is in store for them...
Celine Naville (Diaz) is the spoiled twenty-something daughter of a wealthy businessman. When one of her suitors, a loathsome dentist named Elliott (Stanley Tucci), proposes marriage to her, she offers to say yes, but only if he agrees to play ""William Tell"" with an apple on his head. As she takes aim with a pistol, Elliot's nerves fail and he moves to stop her, spoiling her aim and causing a non-fatal head wound.
Robert Lewis (McGregor) is a janitor employed in the basement of Celine's father's company. His dreams for writing a best-selling trash novel are shot down by his coworkers, he is told that he is being made redundant and replaced by a robot, by his manager. Whilst drowning his sorrows at a local bar, his girlfriend, Lily (K.K. Dodds) tells him she is leaving him for an aerobics instructor.
O'Reilly and Jackson start their process by posing as collection agents repossessing all of Robert's things and evicting him from his apartment. Deciding this is the last straw, Robert storms to the high-rise office of Mr. Naville (Ian Holm) while Naville is berating Celine for the William Tell fiasco. Security guards run in and start to beat Robert to a pulp, but Robert grabs one of their guns and holds them at bay (accidentally shooting Naville in the thigh). When Celine introduces herself, Robert decides to kidnap her.
He drives her to a remote cabin in the California woods. Soon, it becomes clear that Celine is the one in control: after easily slipping free after he has tied her up, she surprises him by sticking around. Robert comes to realize that she is so bored with her normal life, and hates her father so much, that she is staying with the adventure, and the chance to get back at Naville. Eventually, she proposes that they partner up to extort a huge ransom.
O'Reilly and Jackson, now posing as bounty hunters, hire themselves to Naville to retrieve Celine and kill Robert.
After Robert's first attempt to collect the ransom fails (when O'Reilly opens fire on him with a machine gun), he feels downcast, but Celine encourages him that he got away. Feeling cheered up, he takes her out to a rustic bar, where they pretend to be newlyweds, and sing ""Beyond the Sea"" on the karaoke machine. The next morning, Robert wakes up and is stunned to see that he and Celine have apparently slept together.
Robert makes a second demand for the ransom, with a letter written in Celine's blood. Naville gives O'Reilly and Jackson the money, and they go to meet Robert in the forest. To their disappointment, Robert appears willing to let Celine go in exchange for the money before O'Reilly stops his getaway. Aside, Jackson confesses his fears that the two are not in love yet. O'Reilly responds, ""Jeopardy, Jackson. Always works.""
While O'Reilly and Celine wait by their car, Jackson takes Robert into the woods to execute him. Before he can, Celine decks O'Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel. As Robert and Celine drive away, O'Reilly grabs the towbar and rides along. As she points her gun, Robert and Celine jump from the car, and it careens off a cliff, with the money still inside.
Since they are short of money, Celine decides to rob a bank with Jackson's pistol. The robbery goes smoothly, until a security guard shoots at Celine. Robert pushes her out of the way, taking a bullet in the thigh. Celine hurriedly drives him back to the city, to be operated on by Elliot (the closest thing she can find to a discreet medical specialist). A little later, when Robert regains consciousness, he is appalled to see Celine playing a sleazy sexual roleplaying game with Elliott. A fight breaks out, and Robert knocks Elliott unconscious. As they drive away, Celine explains that she only agreed to Elliott's request so he would help Robert - and, in any case, it's none of Robert's business, since he and Celine aren't ""involved,"" whatever he might think. Hurt, Robert gets out of the car and walks away.
To get them back together, Jackson writes a love poem in Robert's handwriting and sends it to Celine. Overcome, she runs back to the bar, where Robert has started working as a janitor, and says he has won her heart with the poem. O'Reilly and Jackson, listening, dance for joy... until Robert says that he's never written a poem in his life. Humiliated, Celine runs out again. But after she's gone, Robert's boss, Al (Tony Shalhoub), knocks some sense into him: Robert has nothing in his life except the improbable love of ""an intelligent, passionate, beautiful, rich woman... so why are you even thinking about it?"" Robert runs after Celine, but is too late: O'Reilly and Jackson, believing they have failed, decide to make their Earth-bound lives bearable by kidnapping Celine for ransom.
Robert tracks Celine to their hideout, where she's being held, blind folded and gagged. Robert knocks O'Reilly down with a punch. As he struggles with Jackson, he tells Celine that he truly does love her. Just as O'Reilly and Jackson are about to give her up and celebrate their success, the door is kicked down by Naville's butler, Mayhew (Ian McNeice), who shoots the two angels in the head (apparently killing them).
Leaving Celine locked in the trunk, Naville and Mayhew drove Robert and the two angels' bodies to the cabin, planning to fake a murder-suicide.
In Heaven, Gabriel's secretary begs him to intervene, but he protests that he doesn't have the authority. Instead, he telephones God and asks Him to do so. God agrees, and Celine is released from the truck by their neighbor, Tod (Maury Chaykin). Taking Tod's gun, she runs to the cabin and confronts her father, while Mayhew holds Robert at gunpoint.
Throughout the film, Robert has had recurring dreams of having his life saved by being shot through the heart by an ""arrow of love."" Taking a leap of faith, Celine shoots Robert through the heart, and the bullet passes through without harming him, to hit Mayhew in the shoulder, crippling him.

3471,A Mighty Heart,"Angelina Jolie stars as Mariane Pearl, wife of slain journalist Daniel Pearl, in director Michael Winterbottom's adaptation of Mariane's memoir recounting the abduction and murder of her husband (played in the film by Dan Futterman) by Pakistani militants. It was on January 23, 2002, that Mariane Pearl's life took a grim and unanticipated turn that no one could have seen coming. The South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, Daniel Pearl, was in Pakistan with his pregnant wife, Mariane, when he set out to conduct one last interview for an upcoming article; the pair were due to fly back home to the U.S. shortly thereafter. By all accounts, it was the same type of interview he had conducted a hundred times before, and though the only concern that Daniel had voiced beforehand was that he might be a bit late for dinner, it would soon become obvious that something had gone horribly awry. Later, in an attempt to rise above the seething vengeance and cycle of violence that the post-9/11 world has fallen into and familiarize her newborn son with the father he will never know, Mariane penned A Mighty Heart: The Brave Life and Death of My Husband Danny Pearl.","On January 23, 2002, Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl is to fly from Karachi to Dubai with his pregnant wife, Mariane, also a reporter. On the day before, with great care, he has arranged an interview in a caf‚àö¬© with an Islamic fundamentalist cleric. When Danny doesn't return, Mariane initiates a search. Pakistani police, American embassy personnel, and the FBI examine witnesses, phone records, e-mails, and hard drives. Who has him? Where is he? There's also the why: because of U.S. abuse of prisoners at Guantanamo, because of a history of Journal cooperation with the CIA, because Pearl is a Jew?

Sonia (Renee Zellweger) gives birth to her first child.

Against the wishes of Mendel, she accepts, displaying her flair for the jewelry business and establishing herself as a very good businesswoman. However, after she befriends sensitive Hispanic artist Ramon (Allen Payne), a sculptor and jewelry designer, she upsets everyone, especially Sender, who bars her from the store.

With stratospheric concern over national security prompting paranoid government officials to begin spying on citizens, trust is a luxury and everyone is a suspected criminal until proven otherwise. Bob Arctor (Keanu Reeves) is a narcotics officer who is issued an order to spy on his friends and report back to headquarters. In addition to being a cop, though, Arctor is also an addict.

7320,A Separation,,"An Iranian film about a divorce doesn't sound like anybody's first choice for a good night out, but proved a compulsive, challenging (and argument-generating) watch.

Iranian cinema is no stranger to critical accolades, but  the Berlin Film Festival winner had narrative twists and taut style to become a crossover hit with a wider audience.Two hours speed by in this densely plotted, morally complex marital drama from writer-director Asghar Farhadi, which brings together two very different sides of contemporary Iran. 

We first meet secular middle-class couple Simin (Leila Hatami) and Nader (Peyman Moaadi) in a divorce hearing involving their 11-year-old daughter. 

Yet the lives of this family are rocked when the father is accused of murder, following an argument with devout, pregnant homehelp Razieh (Sareh Bayat). 

Impressively shot and acted, A Separation refuses to judge its characters: everyone here has their reasons.","muslim,11 year old,koran,joblessness,bed wetting,religion,obligation,indemnification,divorce,gender,investigation,father daughter relationship,hijab,head scarf,responsibility,social differences,hot temper,little girl,murder,miscarriage,depression,dirty money,islam,granddaughter,car accident,oxygen mask,bail,creditor,visa,girl with glasses,mother in law son in law relationship,court of law,judgment,humanity,ethics,junior high school,file for divorce,witness,dead baby,tied to a bed,father son relationship,girl,arrest,poverty,immigration,tutor,school teacher,mother daughter relationship,old man,wanting a divorce,iran,religious intolerance,wrath,separation,alzheimer's disease,head butt,blood money,compensation,elder care,wife leaves husband,husband wife relationship,tehran iran,pregnancy,civilization,class differences,unborn,lie,qur'an",7320.jpg,2011-07-01,,B2Sswx_vrWk,,,Drama
2208,A Serious Man,,"Filmmaking duo Joel and Ethan Coen write, produce, and direct this period black comedy set in 1967 concerning a Midwestern physics professor whose staid and stable life slowly begins to unravel after his wife announces that she's leaving him. As if the failure of his longtime marriage wasn't enough for Larry Gopnik (Tony-nominated Michael Stuhlbarg) to contend with, now his socially inept brother refuses to move out of the house as well. Larry is a modest man of science. Up to this point, his life has been uneventful at best, but things are about to get interesting. When his wife, Judith, announces that she is leaving him to move in with his smug colleague Sy Ableman, Larry does his best to contend with his failed marriage while barely tolerating his unemployable brother, Arthur, who appears to have grown roots on Larry's couch. Meanwhile, Larry's son, Danny, is getting into trouble at Hebrew school, and his daughter, Sarah, is stealthily snatching money from his wallet so she can afford a nose job. As Judith and Sy merrily begin making plans for their new life of domestic bliss together, Larry begins receiving a series of anonymous letters from someone who seems intent on sabotaging his chance for tenure at the university. To further complicate matters, a graduate student with failing grades is attempting to bribe the professor while simultaneously threatening him with a defamation lawsuit. Larry is in some serious need of equilibrium, though it's hard to focus on getting your life in order when your beautiful neighbor insists on sunbathing in the nude just outside your window. Perhaps by seeking the advice of three trusted rabbis, Larry can finally learn to cope with his afflictions and become a genuine mensch. A Serious Man is the second in a two-picture deal that the siblings made with Focus Features and Working Title. The first film in the deal, entitled Burn After Reading and starring Brad Pitt, George Clooney, and Frances McDormand, was released nationwide in September 2008. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","lawn,inner title card,surrealism,tv set,shiva,cave,torah study,religion,bribery,merkin wig,rear end car accident,snow,jew,playing catch,krakow poland,father daughter relationship,firearm pointed at the camera,orthodox jew,cynical,ritual,picking a lock,death,columbia house record club,journey,blood,soup,shot at the camera,jew gentile relationship,reference to jefferson airplane,paradox,obscene finger gesture,professor,cafe,jewish stereotype,shaving,female neighbor,x ray,bored in class,dreaming,black bra,dental receptionist,handcuffs,witty,chase,walking on a roof,mathematics,running,drawing,paranoia,father son relationship,marital breakup,envelope full of money,toilet,suburb,accidental death,1960s,golf,probability map,wanting a divorce,brother brother relationship,unhappy marriage,torah,trust,film within a film,nasty neighbor,zohar,poland,dark comedy,small town,possession,dybbuk,mortality,mazel tov,clever,menorah,shooting,fear,jacobs ladder,cigarette smoking,recording,typhus,loss of faith,overweight man,reference to jimi hendrix,cot,bathroom,doctor,station wagon,defamation,student,record club,boys' bathroom,transistor radio,friendship,divorce,synagogue,morality,bribe,shabbat,goy,mowing a lawn,canada,teacher student conference,prologue,ice tea,coffee,jewish theater,lake,midrash,rowboat,schr‚àö‚àçdinger's cat,rabbi,dutch angle,nose job,chalk,toothache,changing a grade,physics teacher,anger,school bus,reference to shem,teacher,subtitled scene,plastic surgery,car,song,ethnic stereotype,cat,sex,suburbia,man with glasses,horse,false friend,book of job,singer,swimming,teenage boy,uncle nephew relationship,midlife crisis,reference to god,seduction,uncertainty,drug debt,ladder,heart attack,planned car accident,black comedy,neurotic,yiddish,husband wife relationship,jewish humor,notebook,physics student,tenure,heisenberg uncertainty principle,tornado,anonymous letter,pastoral counseling,marital separation,needing money,horse and cart,boy with glasses,house,dysfunctional family,angst,minnesota,university student,best friend,voyeurism,confusion,wine,tragic hero,leg brace,singing,drugs,immaturity,mortgage,widower,woman with glasses,insecurity,get the jewish ritualistic divorce,hebrew school,pursuit,watching tv,snowing,nightmare,funeral,listening to music,attorney,physical examination,mogen david wine,olam haba,wristwatch,uncle niece relationship,psychedelic rock,old testament,physics,pot smoking,swimming pool,deer hunting,driving a car,stoned,yarmulke,spoiled child,divorce lawyer,dead deer,bar mitzvah,mother daughter relationship,old man,mathematical equation,eyeglasses,convenience store,talking to the dead,policeman,mathematics class,crying,humorous,dental nurse,marriage,cyst,marijuana,hunter,bleeding,blackboard,tsuris,curse,man hugging a man,detective,wedding ring,sodomy,unemployment,bus,hebrew,rooftop,neighbor,beach,quantum physics,record player,police,nude sunbathing,nurse,south korean,lublin poland,kabbalah,toilet stall,american midwest,medical examination,letter,dream,love triangle,brother sister relationship,culture clash,stabbed in the chest,killed in a car accident,doubt,class,classmate,bully,car accident,tv antenna,lawyer,girl with glasses,friend,pushover,unpredictability,bordeaux the wine,repressed anger,jewish,threat to sue,droshky,restaurant,marital crisis,arrest,teacher student relationship,golf club,redneck,year 1967,university professor,office,university,card game,gentile,kiddush cup,hashem,car crash,gambling,dentist,grade school,motel,classroom,omen,shtetl,mysticism,agunah,neighbor neighbor relationship,family relationships,self repression,neck cyst",2208.jpg,2009-09-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/a-serious-man/id351800319?uo=4,"92IMQbcHGwE&hd=1,92IMQbcHGwE&fmt=37",,,"Comedy,Drama"
2372,A Simple Wish,"When Anabel (Mara Wilson) wished for a fairy-godmother, she never dreamed his name would be Murray (Martin Short)! Before you can say ""SHABOOM,"" Anabel quickly learns that Murray is short on experience and long on excuses. As they are whisked into a hilarious whirlwind of magical mishaps, Anabel and the blundering Murray have until midnight to rescue her dad, battle a wicked witch (Kathleen Turner) and recover stolen magic wands to restore the world to a place where wishes really can come true.","This comic children's fantasy from director Michael Ritchie stars Mara Wilson as eight-year-old New Yorker Anabel, who wishes that her father Oliver (Robert Pastorelli), a hansom cab driver in Central Park, would see his dream come true. In a thinly veiled jab at the overblown stage productions of Andrew Lloyd Weber, Oliver aspires to be cast in the lead role in a new big-budget musical based on A Tale of Two Cities. Anabel's wish is received by Murray (Martin Short), the very first male fairy godmother, a bumbler who predictably botches the spell fulfilling Anabel's wish, turning Oliver into a statue instead. In order to reverse the mistake, Murray needs help from his union, the North American Fairy Godmothers Association (NAFGA), which is holding a convention in Manhattan. Enter Claudia (Kathleen Turner), a scheming former fairy godmother turned witch, who steals the attendees' magic wands, intending to use their magic in a bid for power. A Simple Wish (1997) was one of four films representing the initial slate of The Bubble Factory, a movie production house assembled by the theater world's Sheinberg family.

7252,A Teacher,,"A high school teacher in Austin, Texas has an affair with one of her students. Her life begins to unravel as the relationship comes to an end.

Hannah Fidell's debut sees a cocky high-school kid get it on with his hot young teacher. It's the first act of Adam Sandler's That's My Boy, without the smirking. In fact, nary a smile is raised throughout this lean indie, whose po-facedness can seem like an affectation, but also casts a quietly intense spell.

No prizes for guessing that the liaison swiftly turns dangerous, but the downward spiral is infused with suspense thanks to Fidell's taut handling and Lindsay Burdge's lead performance. It's a highly contained turn, but leaves little doubt of the desire and desperation raging under the surface.  

This year’s Sundance Film Festival was rife with films about inappropriate sexual relationships. Hannah Fidell’s A Teacher would fit quite neatly in the festival’s most trendy programming. But fortunately for the director/writer/producer, Fidell’s finely tuned feature is a stand-out film in an apparently crowded field.
Unlike both Breathe In and The Lifeguard, Fidell’s film doesn’t track those first hesitant steps toward sex and romance between a disastrously (and often criminally) mismatched pair as, when we meet high school teacher Diana (an astonishingly good Lindsay Burdge) and her student Eric (Will Brittain), they’re already in the middle of their sexual relationship. All is not well, of course, and composer Brian McOmber’s loud and abrasive (and we mean that in the best way possible) score, which queues up the second the film opens, makes sure we know that from the get-go. This is a doomed relationship in every sense.

While we never know exactly why or how Diana and Eric started their relationship, the young teacher does seem to be passably cool to her kids (she’s young enough, pretty enough, relaxed enough with them) and the smartass student appears to be a popular teen who both likes girls and likes holding sway over them. For awhile, there relationship may have actually felt like one built on equanimity and like interest (though, of course, the age issues and the power structure refute that, no matter how the characters might feel), but A Teacher steadily leads us into darker places as that tenuous balance no longer holds true.
It’s fairly obvious straightaway that Diana and Eric are not building a solid relationship ‚ Diana is all emotions and feelings (she’ll be the one to say how happy she is, while Eric seems unable and unwilling to respond in emotional terms), while Eric is focused on the physical and sexual aspects of their relationship (he appeals to Diana’s emotions in order to get her to send him some sexy photos), and the pair never talk about anything of meaning or consequence. Yet Fidell still surprises with the direction of her film, and as honest as it is, as true as it feels, A Teacher still packs a punch.

No one in the household is sure what to do for Abel or how they should behave around him, and a stay in a mental hospital does little to ground him. However, one day Abel wakes up and decides that he's the man of the house, and begins acting like his absent father rather than the youngest child. To the surprise of everyone, adult responsibilities agree with Abel, and the family seems significantly happier with his new personality. But this proves to be short-lived when Abel's real dad unexpectedly returns, and the two vie for the status of head of the household.

7337,Adventureland,"In the summer of 1987, a college grad takes a 'nowhere' job at his local amusement park, only to find it's the perfect course to get him prepared for the real world.

In 1987, James Brennan's dreams of a summer European tour before studying at an Ivy League school in New York City are ruined after his parents have a severe career setback. As a result, James must get a summer job to cover his upcoming expenses at the decrepit local amusement park, Adventureland, where he falls in love with a witty co-worker, Emily Lewin. In that bizarrely shady workplace, the young carnies have unforgettable and painful learning experiences about life, love and trust while James discovers what he truly values.

Director: Greg Mottola
Writer: Greg Mottola
Stars: Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart, Ryan Reynolds","It is the summer of 1987 and James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg), a virgin, has just graduated with a degree in comparative literature from Oberlin College. He is looking forward to touring Europe for the summer and going to Columbia University for graduate school in journalism, when his parents (Wendie Malick and Jack Gilpin) announce they won't be able to help him financially.
James searches for a summer job, but can only find an unappealing one at Adventureland, a local amusement park in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where his immature childhood friend Tommy Frigo (Matt Bush) works. James is hired by assistant manager Bobby (Bill Hader) and is assigned to the games area. He meets his co-workers: the sarcastic Joel (Martin Starr), Bobby's wife and park manager Paulette (Kristen Wiig), Sue O'Malley (Paige Howard), Mark (Mark Miller), the alluring Lisa P. (Margarita Levieva), and the park's technician Mike Connell (Ryan Reynolds), a part-time musician. Another games worker, Emily ""Em"" Lewin (Kristen Stewart), saves James from being stabbed by a disgruntled customer.
While her father and stepmother are away, Em has a party where she and James get to know each other. After the party, Connell, who has been having an affair with Em, comes over to further pursue the affair. Later that week, James goes for a drink with Em and she is surprised to learn James has never had sex. After leaving, James and Em share their first kiss. The following day, James tells Connell about his strong feelings for Em, which Connell reports to her. Em later tells James that she wants to take things slow due to problems in her life, leaving James feeling confused and upset. Sue drunkenly makes out with Joel, but rejects him the next day, saying that her Catholic parents would not allow her to date a Jew; outraged, Em calls her an anti-Semite in front of the entire staff. Lisa P. asks James out on a date, but he has mixed feelings because of his relationship with Em. After Connell talks him into going, he decides to accept her offer to go out.
After the date, during which Lisa and James kiss, James learns Em had called to tell him that she regrets having rejected his feelings. James gives Em some of his marijuana to bake pot cookies to cheer her up. Joel later sees James and Em walking together and, irritated by the whole chain of events, decides to quit. James tries to talk him out of quitting, but Joel has had enough of it all. He also tells James he is angry at him for dating Lisa P. when he is already in love with Em. Wanting to be honest, James tells Em about going out with Lisa P. After hearing of this, Em goes to Connell's mother's home to end their affair. Prompted by Frigo, the park's mentally-challenged parking official tells James he saw Em and Connell doing ""push-ups without any pants on"" in the back of Connell's car.
James goes to Connell's mother's house, which is where Lisa P. told him that Connell takes girls to have sex, and sees Em leaving. Shocked to see James, Em becomes tongue-tied and cannot explain. James leaves angrily, leaving a broken-hearted, crying Em by herself. James tells Lisa P. about the affair and asks her not to tell anyone, but not long after, she tells her friend Kelly. Upon noticing that all the park employees know, Em quits and moves back to New York. James chastises Lisa P. for dismissing Em as a ""homewrecker"" while seeing Connell as blameless. Heartbroken, he drunkenly crashes his dad's car into a tree and passes out. The next morning, his mother angrily wakes him up and tells him that he has to pay using his summer earnings to fix the damage.
Because he must pay for the car, James doesn't have enough money to go to graduate school. Despite his setbacks, he heads for New York City with his parents' blessing, as they finally decide that it's time to let James do what is best for him. In New York, James waits outside Em's apartment. She is reluctant to talk to him, feeling she has ruined everything. James tells her that he sees her in a different way from the way she sees herself, making it clear that he has fallen in love with her. Touched, Em brings James up to her apartment. James reveals he is not going to Columbia this year, and considers next year. He gets out of his wet clothes and finds that Em still has an Adventureland shirt. They kiss and begin to take their clothes off. James asks, ""Are we really doing this?"", and Em says ""I think so.""",,7337.jpg,2009-04-03,,,,,"Romance,Drama,Comedy"

7251,Afternoon Delight,,"A bored housewife looks to spice up her life.

No skyrockets in flight in this cuckoo-in-the-nest comedy, but it serves as a launching pad for Jill Soloway, who won the grand-jury directing gong for her feature debut.

Kathryn Hahn plays Rachel, a thirtysomething family woman with no complaints but a nagging sense of dissatisfAction & Adventure.

After an eye-opening visit to a strip club, she takes under her wing, sex worker, McKenna (Juno Temple), who shakes up Rachel's middle-class malaise good and proper.

This walk on the wild side takes a few predictable turns, but the performances, sexual frankness and juggling of tones (funny, serious, uncomfortable) all hold you tight.

 Afternoon Delight, an off-putting comedy about a too-idle Los Angeles woman that all of a sudden in the last few minutes decides it wants to be a serious movie. First-time feature director Jill Soloway‚Äö√Ñ√¥s script is populated by well-off, well-educated, self-absorbed people who have nothing interesting to say and aren‚Äö√Ñ√¥t much fun to be around, while the lead character thinks it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a good idea to bring an exotic dancer/hooker to Silver Lake to live with her husband and preschool son for a while. With its high female-centric raunch quotient, this has a commercial shot as an adult girls‚Äö√Ñ√¥-night-out comedy, but the lack of any real star power in the cast is a significant detriment.

7231,Ain't Them Bodies Saints,,"The tale of an outlaw who escapes from prison and sets out across the Texas hills to reunite with his wife and the daughter he has never met. David Lowery's timeless Texan thriller is a fine-looking showcase for stars Casey Affleck and Rooney Mara, playing young hooligans (and expectant parents) Bob and Ruth, torn apart when he's locked up for robbery and she gets off scott-free.

Flash forward some years later and Bob has broken free, embarking on a quest to reunite with his family. But it's not just the lawmen he has to worry about.

Lavishly shot across the sun-kissed Texan countryside, Saints owes more than a debt to Terrence Malick especially in the lyrical, walking-through-a-field opening sequence.

Bob (Casey Affleck) and Ruth (Rooney Mara) are hopelessly in love. Even when they fight, they cannot help but fall back into each other‚Äö√Ñ√¥s arms with Bob reminding Ruth he will always follow her, always be with her. But with Bob down on his luck, a bad decision and a few gun shots have him headed off to jail, leaving Ruth without her husband and a baby on the way. Despite this turn of events, Bob and Ruth never give up on each other, a fact made achingly clear from the way they cling to each other even as Bob is being taken away. Ain‚Äö√Ñ√¥t Them Bodies Saints starts where most heist stories end, showing audiences what happens when the dust settles and the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫bad guys‚Äö√Ñ√π are put away.

Skipping ahead four years, Ruth‚Äö√Ñ√¥s daughter, Sylvie, is now grown and the two are now living a quiet life on their own. Bob still writes to Ruth, and she keeps every letter, but beyond that Ruth has not seen him since that faithful day, and Sylvie has never laid eyes on her own father. While there are a few men looking out for Ruth and Sylvie, Officer Patrick Wheeler (Ben Foster) has clearly taken a particular interest in the two. Ironically, Patrick is the officer who was gunned down, which then lead to Bob‚Äö√Ñ√¥s arrest, but it is clear his interest in Ruth is not that of revenge. When news that Bob has escaped prison comes out, Patrick takes it upon himself to deliver the news to Ruth. While she quickly (and definitively) states Bob would not be coming back for her, the moment she is alone, she stares hopefully at the door knob, almost willing it to turn.


The extent of the crime Bob committed (outside of shooting a police officer) was armed robbery, but once he is out, Ruth is not the only one hoping to lay eyes on him again. Bob gets a letter to Ruth, informing her of his plan to come for her and Sylvie, but as he is trying to throw off his pursuers and make his way back to his girls, Patrick is starting to insert himself into Ruth and Sylvie‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lives.

A Marmite film, then, but one with talent and vision in spades.

Some thirty years after donning men's clothing, she finds herself trapped in a prison of her own making. Mia Wasikowska (Helen), Aaron Johnson (Joe) and Brendan Gleeson (Dr. Holloran) join a prestigious, international cast that includes Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Janet McTeer, Brenda Fricker and Pauline Collins.","In 19th century Dublin, Albert Nobbs, an eccentric man in the latter part of middle age, works as a waiter in Morrison's Hotel run by the stingy and controlling Marge Baker. Albert is hard working and saves his money so that one day he will be able to eke out a better life for himself by owning his own business rather than work at the hotel. Beyond his work colleagues, he is all alone in the world. One day, a man named Hubert Page is hired by Mrs. Baker to paint one of the rooms in the hotel. She forces Hubert to share Albert's bed for the one night he is required to stay to complete the work, much to Albert's horror. Hubert discovers the reason Albert did not want to share a room with him. But rather than the issue being a problem, Hubert shows Albert that he can follow a slightly different life path than the one he envisioned for himself - one closer to the life that Hubert leads with his wife Cathleen - which includes getting married and having a wife to support him emotionally. Albert's choice as a bride is his younger flirtatious co-worker Helen Dawes, who, unknown to Albert, is already in a sexual relationship with the brusque and sly Joe Mackins, another co-worker recently arrived to Morrison's.

This incredible underwater adventure gives you extraordinary glimpses of unbelievable creatures that live in an alien world in the deepest depths of the sea. Could these alien life forms be clues to life in outer space?

Joining him is a team of young NASA scientists and marine biologists who consider how these life forms represent life we may one day find in outer space not only on distant planets orbiting distant stars, but also within our own solar system. Aliens of the Deep is the result of expeditions to several hydrothermal vent sites in the Atlantic and the Pacific. These are violent volcanic regions where new planet is literally being born and where the interaction between ocean and molten rock creates plumes of super-heated, chemically-charged water that serve as oases for animals unlike anything ever discovered. Six-foot tall worms with blood-red plumes and no stomach, blind white crabs, and a biomass of shrimp capable of ""seeing"" heat all compete to find just the right location in the flow of the super-heated, life-giving water or to fry trying. Not dependent on sunlight (like all other life on earth), these ecosystems are as close to alien as anything ever imagined and provide one possible blueprint for the life that might exist beyond our world.","expedition,deep sea diving,nasa,heroes,atlantic ocean,creature,underwater,volcanic eruption,shrimp,pacific ocean,scientist,escapades,octopus,ocean floor,exploration,reenactment,danger,volcano,aquatic,port hole,marine biologist,scientific expedition,submersible",692.jpg,2005-01-28, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/aliens-of-the-deep/id188705029?uo=4,,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"

2340,American Pastime,"Powerful story about the dramatic impact WWII had in the home-front as Japanese American families were uprooted from their every day lives and placed into internment camps in Western US in the early 1940's. Faced with a country that now doubted their loyalty and struggling with their new situation, they turn to baseball as a way to handle their plight and find the strength to stand up for themselves becoming a true symbol of honor and pride.","The first scene shows the life of the Nomura family, a typical American family of Japanese descent in 1941, composed of Japanese-born parents and American-born children (in this case, two sons, Lane and Lyle).

They are forced to leave their home in Los Angeles following the infamous Executive Order 9066, signed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Order 9066 permitted the ""exclusion"" of Japanese Americans from the West Coast of the United States, and actual historic footage shows the rounding up of these families, most of whom were (like the Nomura sons) born as American citizens.

The Nomuras find themselves in a dusty, windblown desert camp. The viewer sees some actual footage of Topaz War Relocation Center, shot by Dave Tatsuno, using a camera which had been smuggled into the camp.

The elder Nomura had been a professional baseball player, and he rapidly forms an in-camp league. One of the guards, Billy Burrell (Gary Cole) is a minor-league baseball player, bitter about having been passed over by a recruiter from the New York Yankees. Many of the major leagues' top players were off to war, perhaps giving Burrell another opportunity with the Yankees.

969,American Splendor,"The life of underground comic book writer Harvey Pekar is chronicled in this exceptionally droll film. Told through a collage of dramatic sequences, interviews with the real Pekar and his pals, and quirky animated sequences, this cinematic comic book follows Pekar's career, artistic and otherwise; his marriage; his 'cancer year'; and even his boisterous television appearances.","Harvey Pekar is file clerk at the local VA hospital. His interactions with his co-workers offer some relief from the monotony, and their discussions encompass everything from music to the decline of American culture to new flavors of jellybeans and life itself. At home, Harvey fills his days with reading, writing and listening to jazz. His apartment is filled with thousands of books and LPs, and he regularly scours Cleveland's thrift stores and garage sales for more, savoring the rare joy of a 25-cent find. It is at one of these junk sales that Harvey meets Robert Crumb, a greeting card artist and music enthusiast. When, years later, Crumb finds international success for his underground comics, the idea that comic books can be a valid art form for adults inspires Harvey to write his own brand of comic book. An admirer of naturalist writers like Theodore Dreiser, Harvey makes his American Splendor a truthful, unsentimental record of his working-class life, a warts-and-all self portrait. First published in 1976, the comic earns Harvey cult fame throughout the 1980s and eventually leads him to the sardonic Joyce Barber, a partner in a Delaware comic book store who end ups being Harvey's true soul mate as they experience the bizarre byproducts of Harvey's cult celebrity stature.","megalomania,harvey pekar,fight,college,halloween,celebrity,illustrator,reference to jennie gerhardt,father daughter relationship,reference to theodore dreiser,college student,cynical,loud shirt,file clerk,tape recorder,red chinese ballet,reference to mark twain,cafe,shower,underground,surprise,hospital,computer,witty,based on comic,paranoia,delusion of grandeur,toilet,1960s,graffiti,talk show in plot,1970s,adoption,rock music,trust,hair loss,lentil,dark horse comics,nun,yelling,toledo ohio,new york city,clever,reference to robin the character,cancer,trick or treating,american dream,mtv,recording,internal monologue,stylized,greeting card,bathroom,theatre audience,diner,plebian,doctor,kiss,nerd,loser,bakery,student,friendship,divorce,obsessive compulsive disorder,reference to marlon brando,eating disorder,record collector,lent,green room,blue collar,compulsiveness,anger,comic book,school bus,teacher,cynicism,halloween costume,cat,reference to the little mermaid,railway station,ice skating,breaking the fourth wall,bitterness,collector,prison teacher,underwear,hotel room,autism,junk sale,discographer,artist,coupon,sincere,co worker,neurotic,husband wife relationship,curmudgeon,based on comic book,touching,self referential,jazz music,voice over narration,play within a film,boy,reference to white castle restaurant,stick figure,phd,reference to david letterman,luggage,reference to superman,v.a. hospital,joyce barber,airport,dysfunctional family,retirement,cosmic comics,vocal cords,talking to mirror,low self esteem,robert crumb,based on autobiography,airplane,hamburger,depression,watching tv,reference to walt kelly,vomit,comic book art,guitarist,listening to music,jellybean,thrift store,old woman,lymphoma,holding hands,supermarket,anemia,reference to batman,donut,book signing,theatre production,ohio,obsession,money,vegetarian,cleveland ohio,champagne,grandmother grandson relationship,retirement party,humorous,marriage,prison,1950s,interview,psychoanalysis,telephone,reading,throat doctor,record player,love,fame,garage sale,animated sequence,anticipation,comic book shop,stoicism,cake,adopted daughter,letter,class,vow of silence,1980s,chemotherapy,cynic,clerk,laryngitis,vasectomy,scratching,friend,stoic,television studio,writing,part animation,restaurant,bohemian,recital,illness,offbeat,superhero,american splendor the comic book,food allergy,loneliness,veterans hospital,movie reality crossover,cartoonist,cult figure,family relationships,telephone call,writing teacher",969.jpg,2003-01-20, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/american-splendor/id522993516?uo=4,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g19nAE_ihp0,,,"Art House & International,Comedy,Drama"

Yet, while research proves that teachers are the most important school factor in a child's future success, America'steachers are so woefully underpaid that almost two thirds must divide their time between a second job in order to make a living.Chronicling the stories of four teachers in different areas of the country, American Teacher reveals the frustrating realities oftoday's educators, the difficulty of attracting talented new teachers, and why so many of our best teachers feel forced to leave theprofession altogether. Can we re-value teaching in the United States and turn it into a prestigious, financially attractive andcompetitive desirable profession? With almost half of American teachers leaving the field in the next ten years, now is the time tofind out.","American Teacher is the feature-length documentary created and produced by Vanessa Roth, Ninive Calegari, Dave Eggers, and Brian McGinn. The film includes a musical score by Thao Nguyen and is narrated by Matt Damon. The film chronicles the stories of four teachers living and working in disparate urban and rural areas of the country. Their stories are told through a mixture of footage and interviews with students, families, and colleagues, as well as the teachers themselves. By following these teachers as they reach different milestones in their careers, our film tells the deeper story of the teaching profession in America today. -- (C) Official Site","thought provoking,teacher

7287,Amour,,"Michael Haneke stares mortality in the face

Georges and Anne are in their eighties. They are cultivated, retired music teachers. Their daughter, who is also a musician, lives abroad with her family. One day, Anne has an attack. The couple's bond of love is severely tested.

Old age and terminal illness are placed under Michael Haneke's microscope in Amour.

But far from being a cold, scientific study from a filmmaker frequently accused of placing a pane of glass between his work and his viewers, this sensitive film emerges heartfelt and humane.

Opening with the police breaking down the doors of a Parisian apartment to find the corpse of an old woman laid out in bed, the Austrian auteur then takes us through the months leading up to this discovery.

Octogenarian couple Anne and Georges (Emmanuelle Riva, Jean-Louis Trintignant) share a tender, attentive relationship. Then Anne suffers two strokes and the film records, unflinchingly, her incremental demise.

In evidence, always, is the love of the title (a love far more profound than the honeymoon fervour portrayed in most movies), Georges feeding her, washing her and attending to her toiletry needs.

But present also is the humiliation of debilitation.

Shame, fear, despair frustration... all clog the apartment and provoke an overwhelming sense of suffocation, while an all-too-human loss of patience proves utterly shocking - as cruel and devastating as anything in Haneke's back catalogue.

Contained almost entirely within the couple's elegant apartment, Amour comprises static takes, softly, somberly lit, and the odd track or pan to freshen the frame.

Controlled but never cold, it eschews music to underline the complex emotions at play, instead trusting in Riva and Trintignant's tremendously skilled performances.

Watching Georges struggle to make Anne's deterioration bearable as she, all the while, desperately craves release. How to cope with losing a soulmate? How far do courage and integrity stretch, and to what end? Is a life like this even worth living?

Amour contains its share of caustic confrontations, with the exchanges between Georges and a house nurse (Carole Franck), and between Georges and his daughter (Isabelle Huppert), worthy of Bergman's domestic dramas.

But, for the most part, fighting death is enough. In place of Haneke's signature nihilism and austerity come warmth, nobility and, yes, love. The drama scars all the deeper for it.

A compassionate, masterful work that deservedly won Haneke a second Palme d'Or after The White Ribbon's 2009 victory. Best to avoid on a first date, though.

Her greatest joy is her son Fadi (Melkar Muallen), for whom she stretches her modest salary to keep in private school. Still, when Muna finds out she's received a U.S. Green Card, she's torn between doing what's best for Fadi's future and saying goodbye to her family and everything she knows.

""Al Gore strips his presentations of politics, laying out the facts for the audience to draw their own conclusions in a charming, funny and engaging style, and by the end has everyone on the edge of their seats, gripped by his haunting message,"" said Guggenheim. An Inconvenient Truth is not a story of despair but rather a rallying cry to protect the one earth we all share. ""It is now clear that we face a deepening global climate crisis that requires us to act boldly, quickly, and wisely,"" said Gore.",,"mountain,storm,siberia,urgency,carbon dioxide,temperature,politics,cyclone,speculation,snow,north pole,environmental protest,dying,greenie,breath,new orleans louisiana,death,environmental politics,bush fire,state of emergency,smoke,disaster,shanghai china,warmth,air,clean air,wildfire,antarctica,alarmist,scare tactic,ocean,shelf ice,air pollution,ice floe,apocalypse,truth,smoking,tipping point,armageddon,crisis,greenhouse effect,ozone layer,global warming,meteorologist,species,peer reviewed research,trust,fire,faux,electric car,greenhouse gases,idealism,world,fear,futurama,lecture,emergency,south pole,transportation,drought,science,planet,animal care,hoax,future,climate,wind power,endangered species,forest,environmental movement,glacier,habitat,environmental issue,devastation,kyoto protocol,doomsday,alarm bell,anger,solar power,car,song,bad weather,destruction,education,hurricane,statistics,commentary,ice,wake up call,fuel,mount kilimanjaro,globe,rain,animal,environmentalist,cleaning,no opening credits,sea,earth in the balance,environmentalism,threshold,alarm,fuel emissions,sea level,coastal town,alarm signal,permafrost,automobile,polar expert,slide show,thought provoking,environmental protection,coastal waters,wild fire,weather,meteorology,wind,clean energy,patagonia,atmosphere,greenland,plant life,gas,humidity,raining,hydrocarbon emissions,polar bear,propaganda,plant,europe,vehicle,carbon neutral,tsunami,natural disaster,melting,persuasion,environmental activism,fake,water,atlantic ocean,melting glacier,persistence,pollution,typhoon,research,hurricane katrina,social commentary,planetary emergency,teaching,polar ice cap,earth,warning,motor car,ecosystem,heat,climate change,natural habitat,disturbing,extinction,power,calcutta india,arctic,worldview,neutrality,deforestation,argument,cleaning agent,book of revelation,presidential election,environment,global climate change,environmental crime,solid ice,human failure,antarctic peninsula,ethics,energy conservation,part animation,closing argument,coast,captivating,national emergency,graph,japan,vice president,smog,chimney,eco challenge,audience,meltdown,woods,election,contemplative,climate crisis,environmental disaster,energy,lie",1287.jpg,2006-05-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/an-inconvenient-truth/id267946259?uo=4,wnjx6KETmi4,70046279,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/An_Inconvenient_Truth/70046279,"Documentary,Special Interest"
2034,An Officer and a Gentleman,,"A young man must complete his work at a Navy Flight school to become an aviator, with the help of a tough gunnery sergeant and his new girlfriend.

Zack Mayo grew up without much parental guidance following his mother's suicide when he was an adolescent. His naval seaman father, who was stationed in The Philippines at the time, became his official guardian, a role to which he admitted he did not want. As such, Zack grew up to be a loner and without a true sense of home or adult responsibility. Regardless, he, as a young man, decides to enlist in the navy to become a jet fighting officer, with the initial thirteen week training to take place at the air naval station on Whidbey Island, Washington. He plans on taking as easy a route possible through training, even if it means bending the rules and cutting corners. The drill instructor, Sergeant Emil Foley, seems to relish humiliating the recruits - especially Zack - with the ultimate goal of making them ""DOR"" aka drop on request. Despite being warned against who are known as the ""Puget Debs"" i.e. local girls who try to trap the officer candidates so that they can escape their drab factory lives, Zack and his best friend among the other officer candidates, Sid Worley, take up with two possible Puget Debs, Paula Pokrifki and Lynette Pomeroy respectively. Zack's experiences with Sgt. Foley are an obstacle to him making it through the thirteen weeks without DORing, but also make him come to an admission of why he wants to become an officer. And his experiences with Paula, Sid and Lynette provide him with some grounding as to what it means to be a grown up, despite Paula and Lynette's outward goal of becoming officer's wives by whatever means required.

However, Jenny slowly learns more about David, and by association Danny and Helen, and specifically how they make their money. Jenny has to decide if what she learns about them and leading such a life is worth forgoing her plans of higher eduction at Oxford.","A coming-of-age story about a teenage girl in 1960s suburban London, and how her life changes with the arrival of a playboy nearly twice her age.

In the early 1960's, sixteen year old Jenny Mellor lives with her parents in the London suburb of Twickenham. On her father's wishes, everything that Jenny does is in the sole pursuit of being accepted into Oxford, as he wants her to have a better life than he. Jenny is bright, pretty, hard working but also naturally gifted. The only problems her father may perceive in her life is her issue with learning Latin, and her dating a boy named Graham, who is nice but socially awkward. Jenny's life changes after she meets David Goldman, a man over twice her age. David goes out of his way to show Jenny and her family that his interest in her is not improper and that he wants solely to expose her to cultural activities which she enjoys. Jenny quickly gets accustomed to the life to which David and his constant companions, Danny and Helen, have shown her, and Jenny and David's relationship does move into becoming a romantic one. However, Jenny slowly learns more about David, and by association.

This whole, stupid country is boring cries Jenny, a book-smart teen itching to get out of the stuffy Twickenham of 1961 and into the cosmopolitan world beyond. But life is about to get a lot less dull for this Oxford-bound, thanks to a gently predatory thirtysomething who whisks her away in his Bristol saloon and satisfies her craving for culture and sophistication in return for her virginity. 

It's a simple coming-of-age story, unfussily adapted by Fever Pitch's Nick Hornby from columnist Lynn Barber's memoir. Thanks to a near-perfect mixture of elements, though compassionate direction from Lone Scherfig, terrific period detail and, above all, a spectacularly winning turn from newcomer Carey Mulligan in the lead role An Education is a constant delight. 

That's no mean feat for a movie whose male lead is a sleazy cradle-snatcher with several skeletons in his closet. Yet Peter Sarsgaard works hard to make the opportunistic David sympathetic, helped no end by a script which treats him more evenhandedly than Barber does his real-life counterpart. 

It helps too that the world he whisks Jenny into is a beguiling one of jazz and champagne, populated by elegant hedonists like Dominic Cooper's natty Danny and Rosamund Pike's thick-as-a-plank Helen. It's only later that Jenny begins to realise how shallow her new existence is a hard-won discovery achieved with the assistance of Olivia Williams' quietly affecting English teacher and Emma Thompson's amusingly stern headmistress. 

Elsewhere Alfred Molina is splendid as Jenny's dad, a blustering buffoon readily taken in by David's easy charm, while Sally Hawkins has a small but telling cameo late in the story. Ultimately, though, this is Mulligan's film, the 24-year-old starlet stealing our hearts as surely as Audrey Hepburn did half a century ago with a performance of dimpled sweetness and impish precocity.

Keaton's horrified parents snub the nerd-ish city slicker who loves their daughter, but they move in together, anyway. Insecure Allen is so sure he will lose Keaton that he interprets her every move as rejection. As Keaton's self-confidence grows, Allen's progressively fades. Keaton debuts as a singer, is ""discovered"" by a record tycoon and agrees to move to Hollywood and live with him.

7327,Another Earth,,"On the night of the discovery of a duplicate planet in the solar system, an ambitious young student and an accomplished composer cross paths in a tragic accident.

From When Worlds Collide to Melancholia, rogue planets have given sci-fi plenty of apocalyptic wow. The appearance of a second Earth in the sky prompts a more intimate cataclysm in Mike Cahill and rising-star Brit Marling‚Äö√Ñ√¥s hypnotic chamber drama of grief and guilt. Speculative rather than spectacular, this festival hit resembles Solaris crossed with Rabbit Hole on planet Sundance.

Marling is Rhoda, an MIT student tossed into jail when, drunk-driving and distracted by Earth 2, she accidentally kills a young family except the dad, John (Lost‚Äö√Ñ√¥s William Mapother). Four years on, freed and seeking atonement, she becomes cleaner then lover to a grief-wrecked John, who doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t know her true identity.

That psychological stew becomes distinctly sci-fi flavoured when Earth 2 is revealed to be a mirror of ours. In bigger films, Earth 2 would cause mass eco-panic. Here it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a cosmic question mark, its meaning lateral not literal, causing oodles of soul-searching and head-scratching rather than tsunamis.

Cahill registers Earth 2‚Äö√Ñ√¥s micro and macro impact by smartly layering character and ideas. The handheld-camera plunge into Rhoda and John‚Äö√Ñ√¥s emotional wreckage is the film‚Äö√Ñ√¥s raw heart, but there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s brain-food too in the hum of media pundits debating Earth 2‚Äö√Ñ√¥s scientific challenges.

Although plausibility issues do linger ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Rhoda‚Äö√Ñ√¥s easy insinuation into John‚Äö√Ñ√¥s life takes some swallowing ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ suspend disbelief and Another Earth is US indie sci-fi in a seductive Euro-arthouse mould, designed to provoke and prod. If Marling enters Hollywood‚Äö√Ñ√¥s orbit ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ which she surely will ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ here‚Äö√Ñ√¥s hoping its sensibility stays with her.

Marling‚Äö√Ñ√¥s breakout film thrums with restrained thought and feeling. Flawed but fully felt, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a trip worth taking for those who like sci-fi small-scale but full of soul and ideas.

3558,Another Year,"A married couple who have managed to remain blissfully happy into their autumn years, are surrounded over the course of the four seasons of one average year by friends, colleagues, and family who all seem to suffer some degree of unhappiness.","British filmmaker Mike Leigh delivers another emotionally honest portrait of ordinary people trying to make sense of their lives in this comedy drama. Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) are a couple who are drifting past middle age into their sixties; he's a geologist and she's a psychotherapist. Tom and Gerri have a stable and happy marriage and a grown son, Joe (Oliver Maltman), an activist lawyer who hasn't settled down yet, much to his mother's chagrin. One of Gerri's co-workers and close friends is Mary (Lesley Manville), who puts up a facade of desperate good cheer despite the fact she's been very lonely since her husband left her and has been drowning her anxieties in wine. Gerri has unsuccessfully tried to fix Mary up with Tom's sloppy but good natured pal Ken (Peter Wight), and she's startled when Mary begins openly flirting with Joe, more than 20 years her junior. Mary's troubles only grow worse when she stops by Tom and Gerri's place only to be introduced to Katie (Karina Fernandez), Joe's new girlfriend.

At the 50-year line of this gridiron cosmos is Al Pacino as Tony D'Amato, the embattled Sharks coach facing a full-on blitz of team strife plus a new, marketing-savvy sharks owner Cameron Diaz) who's sure Tony is way too old school. An injured quarterback (Dennis Quaid), a flashy, bull-headed backup qb (Jamie Foxx), a slithery team doctor (James Woods) and a running back with an incentive-laden contract (LL Cool J) also provide some of the stories that zigzag like diagrams in a playbook. and throughout, there's the awesome spectacle of motion, sound and action orchestrated by Stone.","When a devastating hit knocks a professional football legend and quarterback Cap Rooney out of the game, a young, unknown third-stringer is called in to replace him. Having ridden the bench for years because of a string of bad luck stories and perhaps insufficient character, Willie Beaman seizes what may be his last chance, and lights up the field with a raw display of athletic prowess. His stunning performance over several games is so outstanding and fresh it seems to augur a new era in the history of this Miami franchise, and forces aging coach Tony D'Amato to reevaluate his time-tested values and strategies and begin to confront the fact that the game, as well as post-modern life may be passing him by. Adding to the pressure on D'Amato to win at any cost is the aggressive young President/Co-owner of the team, Christina Pagniacci, now coming into her own after her father's death. Christina's driving desire to prove herself in a male dominated world is intensified by her focus on the marketing and business of football, in which all coaches and players are merely properties.

7291,Argo,"On November 4, 1979, as the Iranian revolution reaches its boiling point, militants storm the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 Americans hostage. But, in the midst of the chaos, six Americans manage to slip away and find refuge in the home of Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor. Knowing it is only a matter of time before the six are found out and likely killed, the Canadian and American governments ask the CIA to intervene. The CIA turns to their top ""exfiltration"" specialist, Tony Mendez, to come up with a plan to get the six Americans safely out of the country. A plan so incredible, it could only happen in the movies.","A dramatization of the 1980 joint CIA-Canadian secret operation to extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of revolutionary Iran. In 1979, the American embassy in Iran was invaded by Iranian revolutionaries and several Americans were taken hostage. However, six managed to escape to the official residence of the Canadian Ambassador and the CIA was eventually ordered to get them out of the country. With few options, exfiltration expert Tony Mendez devised a daring plan: to create a phony Canadian film project looking to shoot in Iran and smuggle the Americans out as its production crew. With the help of some trusted Hollywood contacts, Mendez created the ruse and proceed to Iran as its associate producer. However, time was running out with the Iranian security forces closing in on the truth while both his charges and the White House had grave doubts about the operation themselves.

Director/star Ben Affleck tells the unlikely but true-life story of the ""making"" of sci-fi epic Argo, in reality the cover for a CIA mission to rescue U.S. diplomats from troubled Iran in 1979.

With Gone Baby Gone and The Town, Ben Affleck silenced his critics, joining Clint Eastwood and George Clooney in the elite club of A-list actors turned credible directors.

Not content with resting on his laurels, Affleck's third feature sees him stepping out of his comfort zone.

Leaving behind the familiar setting of his beloved Boston for a more global backdrop, Argo builds on his earlier efforts in both scope (hopping between Washington, Hollywood and Tehran) and ambition: a period-set, true-story drama that tackles an incendiary period in the history of US-Iranian relations.

Set during the 1979 hostage crisis, in which local revolutionaries seized Tehran's US Embassy, Argo tells the story of six Americans who managed to escape.

Holed up in the Canadian ambassador's house, their only hope of getting out alive is CIA _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°exfiltrator' Tony Mendez (Affleck).

His plan? To fly into Iran with fake IDs and convince the new powers that the six are a Canadian film crew scouting locations for Argo, a Star Wars-inspired space opera.

The real challenge? Creating a watertight cover by duping Tinseltown itself, via casting calls, launch parties and Variety ads_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_

Affleck's biggest test - and success - here is fusing various story strands, each with a very different ambiance_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_

In DC, Affleck channels All The President's Men-era Pakula: all shady sets, crash zooms and political wrangling.

In Hollywood, Argo becomes a slick industry satire, John Goodman's wry FX genius and Alan Arkin's take-no-prisoners producer (_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•If I'm gonna make a fake movie, it's gonna be a fake hit!_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´) making for a triumphant double act.

In Tehran, it's grainy, gritty and full of standout set-pieces (a charged chase through a bustling bazaar, a palpably paranoid airport interrogation_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_) that reveal a directorial flair for sustained, sweaty-palmed suspense.

Part comic caper, part political thriller, Affleck's genre-mashing mongrel is a strange beast. And yet somehow he makes it work, anchoring proceedings with a likeable, layered lead performance.

Sure, there's a couple of wobbles - a subplot involving Affleck's sci-fi-loving son adds unnecessary schmaltz, while the six embassy employees are largely undercooked - but Argo sees the director growing in confidence and broadening his range.

It's another victorious riposte to his detractors: in the words of Mendez and co, _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•Ar-go fuck yourselves_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫__‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´

Verdict:

Combining laughs and thrills with plenty of verve, Ben Affleck continues his smart directorial career with a stylish, gripping hostage drama.

Life changes for the Clocks when their daughter, Arrietty, is discovered. 14-year-old Arrietty and the rest of the Clock family live in peaceful anonymity as they make their own home from items that they borrow from the house's human inhabitants. However, life changes for the Clocks when a human boy discovers Arrietty. ","The story of the diminutive junk-hoarding Borrowers, as reimagined by Studio Ghibli. Small in stature, a giant in spirit - the year's finest animation.

Veteran Ghibli animator Hiromasa Yonebayashi made his debut, suggesting that the studio is in safe hands whenever Hayao Miyazaki retires for good.Studio Ghibli borrows from English literature so often (Jonathan Swift, Lewis Carroll) that this animated take on Mary Norton's children's classic The Borrowers is a no-brainer. 

The set-up, in which sickly schoolboy Sh‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√° discovers fantasy creatures in his new home, revisits territory long mined by Ghibli's creative guru (and Arrietty co-screenwriter) Hayao Miyazaki, while Norton's diminutive family of household scavengers have already been adapted into a BBC mini-series and a Hollywood comedy. 

What's remarkable, then, is how fresh this is. Miyazaki hands directorial duties to long-term animator Hiromasa Yonebayashi, who focuses firmly on the eponymous teen heroine, a novice Borrower beguiled by the _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°human beans', inverting traditional Ghibli logic. Where Miyazaki gazes out upon a strange new universe, Arrietty looks in and finds everyday bric-a-brac just as wondrous. 

The Borrowers are endlessly resourceful, at once artists who turn postage stamps into posters, and microscopic mountaineers who forge grappling hooks from earrings. 

The accompanying story charms, a bucolic jaunt that barely breaks stride even during set-pieces involving a predatory crow or a suspicious housekeeper. 

That said, Yonebayashi's child-like delight is underscored with a pessimistic parable about the current financial crisis. The film's biggest (off-screen) villain is the divorcee mother who abandons Sh‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√° to travel on business, whereas Arrietty's parents are Daily Mail-friendly hunter/gatherer and homemaker. 

But this is Ghibli, so it's actually more of a gentle elegy for the endangered lifestyle of _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö√°little people' everywhere _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü and as moving as anything this great studio has produced.

Here the boyish freshman's ambition is to become the world's greatest artist, like his hero Picasso.

Neither his harsh judgments of his classmates' efforts nor his later attempts to create pseudo-art of his own win him any admirers. But Jerome does attract the attentions of his dream girl, the stunning and sophisticated Audrey (Sophia Myles), an artist's model and daughter of a celebrated artist. Rejecting the affectations of the local art scene, Audrey is drawn to Jerome's sincerity. When Audrey shifts her attention to Jonah (Matt Keeslar), a hunky painter who becomes the school's latest art star, Jerome is heartbroken.

77,Babel,"In Babel, a tragic incident involving an American couple in Morocco sparks a chain of events for four families in different countries throughout the world. In the struggle to overcome isolation, fear, and displacement, each character discovers that it is family that ultimately provides solace. In the remote sands of the Moroccan desert, a rifle shot rings out - detonating a chain of events that will link an American tourist couple's frantic struggle to survive, two Moroccan boys involved in an accidental crime, a nanny illegally crossing into Mexico with two American children and a Japanese teen rebel whose father is sought by the police in Tokyo. Separated by clashing cultures and sprawling distances, each of these four disparate groups of people are nevertheless hurtling towards a shared destiny of isolation and grief. In the course of just a few days, they will each face the dizzying sensation of becoming profoundly lost - lost in the desert, lost to the world, lost to themselves - as they are pushed to the farthest edges of confusion and fear as well as to the very depths of connection and love.","4 interlocking stories all connected by a single gun all converge at the end and reveal a complex and tragic story of the lives of humanity around the world and how we truly aren't all that different. In Morocco, a troubled married couple are on vacation trying to work out their differences. Meanwhile, a Moroccan herder buys a rifle for his sons so they can keep the jackals away from his herd. A girl in Japan dealing with rejection, the death of her mother, the emotional distance of her father, her own self-consciousness, and a disability among many other issues, deals with modern life in the enormous metropolis of Tokyo, Japan. Then, on the opposite side of the world the married couple's Mexican nanny takes the couple's 2 children with her to her son's wedding in Mexico, only to come into trouble on the return trip. Combined, it provides a powerful story and an equally powerful looking glass into the lives of seemingly random people around the world and it shows just how connected we really are.

But the journey to uncover the truth leads to some dangerous and unexpected places when two rescued survivors tell dramatically different versions of what transpired. ""Totally mesmerizing."" (Lisa Petrillo, WFOR/CBS (Miami)/Extra)","Tom Hardy, an ex-Army Ranger turned DEA agent, is drawn into an ever-widening mystery surrounding the disappearance of the feared and often hated Sgt. Nathan West, as well as several of his elite Special Forces trainees on what appears, at first, to have been a routine training exercise during a hurricane in the jungles of Panama. Only two survivors are found, Dunbar, and a badly wounded Kendall, the son of a high-profile Joint Chiefs of Staff official. Neither is willing to cooperate with Capt. Julia Osborne's investigation. So base commander Col. Bill Styles calls in ex-Ranger Hardy, an old friend and a persuasive interrogator. Osborne disapproves of Hardy who is on leave from the D.E.A. after having come under suspicion of accepting bribes from local drug traffickers. She is also uneasy when she learns that Hardy once trained under West and hates him almost as passionately as his current recruits. With time running out, Hardy and Osborne call a temporary, if uneasy, truce. Hardy cajoles a confession out of Dunbar, who claims that Sgt. West and the missing Rangers have been murdered and their bodies blown away by the hurricane. When they later interview Kendall, he confirms that the other Rangers and West are dead. But, in almost every other way, his story contradicts Dunbar's. What happened to West and his Ranger team? And what were they really doing out there in the jungle? As each layer reveals more lies and greater deceptions, Hardy and Osborne inch towards the horrible truth about the fate of the missing Rangers.","covert operation,government agent,multiple perspectives,revelation,heavy rain,military crime,army,2000s,army life,contradictory accounts,shot in the leg,cell phone,chewing tobacco,necklace yanked off,panama canal,helicopter,murder,flashback,cocaine,death,tense,stabbed in the chest,poison,faked death,rough,gun,shot in the back,panama,racial slur,suspenseful,anger,shot to death,corruption,hostage,drug enforcement,shot in the forehead,homosexual,belize,shot in the chest,surprise,blood vomiting",89.jpg,2003-03-28, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/basic/id292722954?uo=4,5TBBhkzGktQ,60027203,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Basic/60027203,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

7277,Beasts of the Southern Wild,"Hushpuppy, an intrepid six-year-old girl, lives with her father, Wink, in the Bathtub, a southern Delta community at the edge of the world. Wink's tough love prepares her for the unraveling of the universe; for a time when he's no longer there to protect her. When Wink contracts a mysterious illness, nature flies out of whack, temperatures rise, and the ice caps melt, unleashing an army of prehistoric creatures called aurochs. With the waters rising, the aurochs coming, and Wink's health fading, Hushpuppy goes in search of her lost mother. ","As a relentless storm approaches a southern Louisiana bayou community called the ""Bathtub"" (a community cut off from the rest of the world by a levee), five-year-old Hushpuppy and her unhealthy, hot-tempered father, Wink, are optimistic about their life and their future. The children in school are being taught by Miss Bathsheba about nature and the release of prehistoric creatures called ""Aurochs"" from the melting ice caps. At home, Hushpuppy fends for herself while her father is missing. When he returns, they argue and Hushpuppy sets her house on fire. A chase ensues between the two, and she ends up getting slapped by Wink. When she retaliates by punching him in the heart, Wink suffers a cardiac arrest. Hushpuppy, having realised the damage she has caused, runs to fetch help only to find her father missing when she returns.
Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the frozen Aurochs in an ice shelf start drifting into the ocean.
Many of the Bathtub residents start fleeing due to the threat of the oncoming storm. Wink reappears staggering along the side of the road and finds and drags Hushpuppy home to start barricading before the storm hits the town. In an effort to make his daughter feel better Wink attempts to scare off the storm by firing a shotgun at the clouds. The next day, the two tour the devastation and connect with the surviving residents. The Bathtub residents celebrate and make plans to rebuild their community, but everything begins to die because of the salt water brought in by the storm surge. Wink hatches a plan to drain the water away by destroying the levee. A little dynamite does the trick, the water recedes but it doesn't matter, and it brings the authorities who force the mandatory evacuation order, removing the inhabitants of the Bathtub to an emergency shelter. There, Dr. Maloney performs surgery on Wink, but it doesn't restore Wink's health. At the first opportunity, the evacuees storm out and escape back to their homes.
Aware of her father‚Äö√Ñ√¥s condition, Hushpuppy leaves in search of her mother. She and her friends swim to a boat which takes them to a floating bar. Hushpuppy meets a waitress who may be her mother, though the woman doesn't recognize her. She wants to stay but the waitress tells her she can't take care of her. Hushpuppy and her friends return home, where she confronts the Aurochs freed from the ice caps and recognizes the animals as friends. As the Aurochs leave, Hushpuppy enters her home and says her last goodbyes to the dying Wink, listening to his last heartbeat. She sets his funeral pyre ablaze, standing in solidarity along with the remaining residents of the Bathtub.","flooding,defrost,shack,fish,diagnosis,storm,party,shrimping,sparkler,village,boar,remodernist,shotgun,six year old,tattoo,father daughter relationship,screaming,helicopter,little girl,funeral pyre,goat,delta,alligator gar,fried alligator,blood,kitchen,southern u.s.,hog,oscar nominee,cat food,submerged,precociousness,alcohol,funeral,single parent,owl,auroch,hospital,bell ringing,crawfish,african american child,drunk,child's drawing,explosive,young girl,running,search for mother,drawing,chicken,natural disaster,fly the insect,tough love,apocalypse,fishing with one's hands,mother daughter relationship,cooking,baby,boots,global warming,dead cow,coughing blood,levee,child abuse,motorboat,louisiana,settlement,hiding in a cardboard box,crying,beast in title,terminal illness,boat,oscar 2013,hospital bracelet,lost mother,absent mother,fire,bird,viking funeral,dead bird,caterpillar,fishing,dog,raft,garden,melting ice caps,catfish,bullhorn,bus,oscar,wild man,dead tree,doctor,deathbed,mud,beer,dead alligator,grits,jar,nightclub,face slap,collapse,cardboard box,scream,child drinking alcohol,drunkenness,child's point of view,punched in the chest,hiding,heartbeat,flood,food,explosion,prehistoric creature,hospital gown,dead animal,throwing things,teacher,five word title,bayou,dancing,trailer,heroine,children,alcoholic,house on stilts,kneeling,salt water,hurricane,swimming,storytelling,girl,underwear,refugee camp,poverty,illness,ice,alligator,rain,animal,arm wrestling,shrimp,single father,community,female protagonist,evacuation,crab,pig,spitting out pill,trip wire,african american,living outside society,black american,end of the world,fishing net,fireworks,family relationships,eating,voice over narration,celebration,child protagonist,chihuahua,killing an alligator,magical realism,dying father,river",7277.jpg,2012-10-19,,ZF7i2n5NXLo,70229269,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Beasts_of_the_Southern_Wild/70229269,"Kids & Family,Drama"
7129,Beautiful Creatures,"Ethan longs to escape his small Southern town. He meets a mysterious new girl, Lena. Together, they uncover dark secrets about their respective families, their history and their town.

Emmy Rossum, Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson, Viola Davis","Based on the first of four Caster Chronicles novels by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, published in 2009, the story merely flip-flops the sexes, as a small-town high school boy becomes enamored of a girl with strong family ties to the dark side. Nicely cast and made with as much conviction as can be brought to something so intrinsically formulaic, this Warner Bros. release has an large and eager built-in fan base that will pack theaters with gobs of girls and more than a few boys upon its Valentine's Day opening, with people on both sides naturally hoping that this is the start of something big, franchise-wise.
Told, at least at first, from the point of view of the boy, Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), this is literally the story of a dream of his come true -- a recurring dream of a young woman partly obscured from view on a Civil War battlefield but one in which Ethan always ends up getting hit by lightning. That's pretty much what Ethan feels like is happening to him when a dark-haired beauty, Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert), arrives at school and gives him something to think about other than applying to college.
No doubt with the target audience in mind, Ethan, whose mother has died and whose father is never seen, has been matured slightly here from the book's high school sophomore to a 17-year-old with college on his mind. Anxious to escape from stifling, religion-bound Gatlin, S.C., where even To Kill a Mockingbird is banned from the school, Ethan's devouring Henry Miller, Ayn Rand and Kurt Vonnegut and is turned on to Charles Bukowski by Lena, whose initial frostiness quickly melts when it becomes clear Ethan might become her only ally in a school where the prim, Bible-bound conservatives think she's a Satanist.
It's actually a bit more complicated than that. Every story like this needs to invent a mythology intriguing enough to sucker you in, and this one has its roots at Ravenwood Manor, a spooky nearby mansion where recluse Macon Ravenwood (Jeremy Irons), heir to the town's founding family and still owner of much of the town, hides himself away. Ethan has the guts to sneak in for a look, is greeted in courtly fashion by the elegant Southern gent and soon gets the lowdown: Lena should not become close to Ethan because she's a Caster, already endowed with the power to harness the elements (she brings the windows of her classroom crashing in on her silly schoolmates). Upon her upcoming 16th birthday, she will be subjected to the Claiming, which will determine whether she is ‚Äö√Ñ√∫claimed‚Äö√Ñ√π by the Light or the Dark.
Macon, who tries to keep his Dark proclivities in check, hopes to prevent his niece from inheriting a similar fate, though it's never actually stated what the difference would be between having Light and Dark powers (presumably the former are too boring for words, not to mention teen fiction). Understandably nervous about her looming birthday, Lena also wants to experience something akin to a normal adolescence and opens herself to a romance with the ever-enthusiastic Ethan, who's happy to oblige and remains largely oblivious to the land mines that lie ahead in their relationship.
Turning up to promote the Dark cause are two Sirens, Ridley (Emmy Rossum), a wild thing who rolls into town in a red-hot BMW convertible and, since turning 16, has never met anyone she didn't want to corrupt, and Sarafine (Emma Thompson), another Dark Caster who isn't going to make it any easier for Macon to keep Lena in line until her birthday. Both actresses clearly relish whooping it up as bad girls, and Thompson has the double pleasure of also playing Gatlin's uptight guardian of morality, Mrs. Lincoln, who's also the mother of Ethan best friend Link (Thomas Mann).
The central thrust of the story is a teenage girl's anxiety and troubled contemplation of imminent womanhood, which in Lena's case has a fixed date and implications beyond the concerns of her peers.

3026,Becoming Chaz,"Chaz Bono was a male trapped in a female shell for as long as he can remember. Growing up as Sonny and Cher's adorable golden-haired daughter in a body he felt wasn't his own was a crucible it took years to transcend. Now, as he undertakes gender reassignment, he's bravely decided to share the process on camera. Becoming Chaz invites us along on Chaz's remarkable journey of transformation. As hormone shots give way to top surgery, down-to-earth, unflappable Chaz beams with a sense of liberation and goes public with his story to put a face on a misunderstood issue. Meanwhile, his gregarious girlfriend grapples with the realities of suddenly living with a man, and it's clear sex change isn't solely a physical transition. Intimate and nakedly honest, the film reveals the humanity and courage it takes for Chaz to ultimately embrace his true self. His moving struggle will reverberate profoundly for anyone to whom authenticity matters.","Chastity Bono grew up in the public eye as the daughter of pop stars Sonny & Cher, making occasional appearances on their popular television show in the 1970s. But Chastity was not the person the public imagined she was; Bono struggled with gender and sexual identity issues for years before coming out as a transsexual, a man living in the body of a woman. Adopting the name Chaz Bono, the former Chastity set out on the long road to physically transform his body into that of a man. Filmmakers Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato were given near total access to Bono as he deals with the physical and emotional challenges of reshaping his body into that of a male (as well as the complex legal ramifications) in the documentary Becoming Chaz. The film also includes interviews with Chaz's mother Cher, his longtime girlfriend Jennifer Elia, and his stepmother Mary Bono Mack, all of whom have their own ways of dealing with profound changes in someone they love. Becoming Chaz received its world premiere at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi","gender transition,sex change,testosterone,interview,gender identity,family relationships,gender,breast removal,transgender,transsexual,surgery,hormone",3026.jpg,2011-01-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/becoming-chaz/id500461766?uo=4,,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"
1666,Becoming Jane,"Anne Hathaway gives a radiant performance as a young, lovestruck Jane Austen in the witty and engaging romantic comedy Becoming Jane. It's the untold romance that inspired the novels of one of the worlds most celebrated authors. When the dashing Tom Lefroy a reckless and penniless lawyertobe, enters Jane's life, he offends the emerging writer s sense and sensibility. Soon their clashing egos set off sparks that ignite a passionate romance and fuel Jane s dream of doing the unthinkable marrying for love.","The year is 1795 and young Jane Austen is a feisty 20-year-old and emerging writer who already sees a world beyond class and commerce, beyond pride and prejudice, and dreams of doing what was then nearly unthinkable - marrying for love. Naturally, her parents are searching for a wealthy, well-appointed husband to assure their daughter's future social standing. They are eyeing Mr. Wisley, nephew to the very formidable, not to mention very rich, local aristocrat Lady Gresham, as a prospective match. But when Jane meets the roguish and decidedly non-aristocratic Tom Lefroy, sparks soon fly along with the sharp repartee. His intellect and arrogance raise her ire - then knock her head over heels. Now, the couple, whose flirtation flies in the face of the sense and sensibility of the age, is faced with a terrible dilemma. If they attempt to marry, they will risk everything that matters - family, friends and fortune.","fire eater,public reading,fight,courtroom,court,party,novelist,unconsciousness,falling asleep,candle,prostitute,rural setting,drink,fianc‚àö¬© fianc‚àö¬©e relationship,sign language,voyeurism,father daughter relationship,sister sister relationship,dancer,piano,church,singing,death,minister,death of fianc‚àö¬©,wealth,independence,boxing,flash forward,dance,boxing match,uncle niece relationship,sermon,public nudity,mirror,skinny dipping,betrayal,judge,1790s,mother daughter relationship,pastor,country life,english country dance,brother brother relationship,male nudity,cricket the game,georgian,seashore,sentimental,embarrassment,aunt nephew relationship,humorous,marriage,gun,livestock,vicar,stiltwalker,hunter,library,class differences,dog,bittersweet,georgian romance,nudity,male rear nudity,love declaration,reading,drinking,marriage proposal,beach,irish,love,older woman younger man relationship,kiss,contessa,parish,writer,mute,public humiliation,montage,letter,brother sister relationship,forest,rector,women's liberation,knocked out,anger,horse riding,hunting,country estate,lawyer,women's rights,dancing,song,cousin cousin relationship,opera singer,horse,deaf and dumb,writing,singer,swimming,upper class,heartbreak,farm,star crossed lovers,author,juggler,england,poverty,uncle nephew relationship,bare butt,artist,pianist,rain,balcony,horse and carriage,elopement,london england,woods,pig,gambling,husband wife relationship,emotional,wedding,empire fashion,maid,lady,family relationships,rifle,potato,voice over narration,castle,celebration,unrequited love,estate",1666.jpg,2007-03-02, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/becoming-jane/id432628158?uo=4,OYViBfUvSOA,70065107,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Becoming_Jane/70065107,"Drama,Romance"

1106,Beef,"A documentary on the evolution of MC battles from verbal one-upmanship to street warfare. Beef is a solid, retrospective documentary on the competitive and increasingly violent nature of Hip Hop music and culture. Acclaimed rapper KRS-One makes this film great through his consistant voice of reason.

Director: Peter Spirer
Writers: Peter Alton, Peter Spirer
Stars:Ving Rhames, 50 Cent, Kevin Anderson","Beef is a Hip Hop feud or a Hip Hop rivalry that can occur through a misunderstanding or just because, and it's defined as a controversy in which two or more rappers create a rivalry that is manifested by slandering and confronting the other in a number of ways. Another way of saying it is to just call it a ""diss"", which is one rapper disrespecting another one. When two rappers or emcee's battle, it's simply to determine who can rhyme the best, who's wittier, and whose head is in the right place. Basically, just who is the freshest. Hip Hop is very aggressive, highly competitive, and it's similar to a contact sport.

Hip Hop feuds have been around for at least two decades, and they can spawn at any time over any situation. Since its birth it has created some fantastic music. Careers have been ended, and some have been propelled into superstar status because of it. Many Hip Hop artist owe their very careers to beef; KRS-One, 50 Cent, Roxanne Shante, LL Cool J, and several others. Beef is a 2003 documentary that chronicles a majority of the premier feuds in Hip Hop which began in 1981, it's directed by Peter Spirer and Narrated by Ving Rhames. The documentary features archived and exclusive interviews by Ice T, KRS-One, Mack-10, Common, Damon Dash, Angie Martinez and many others, as well as plenty of diss songs along with video clips.

The documentary is well put together and kicks things off with the earliest recorded battle between Kool Moe Dee and Busy Bee, it showed the birth of the lyrical battle emcee, and the light-hearted and fun nature of the battle. It was just basically about who could rock the party. Another famous battle in Hip Hop lore was also KRS-One vs. MC Shan, and here you will hear from both artist. I just can't help but notice that Shan was still mad about that battle. It's all in his voice plus he even had new lyrics to battle KRS again.

The documentary also goes into the business aspect of beef, and how it can spill over on to record, by going into a very vicious beef between Ice Cube and NWA, which began when the former noticed some slick behind the scenes tactics going on with their contracts as a group. He left the group to pursue his solo career, only for his former crew to attack him, and as he responded the disses only became bigger. I also enjoyed another view, which happened to be the thug element becoming a factor, in which, a beef developed between Tru-Life and Mobb Deep, this resulted in Tru-Life taking their words on wax seriously, and invading a recording studio with guns and beating the hell out of Mobb Deep's camp. The infamous East Coast/West Coast feud, or the Biggie vs. Tupac beef is somewhat covered, but just not completely. I'm actually happy about that since there was so much coverage on it in magazines back then, and I was actually afraid of this turning into a Tupac vs. Biggie DVD. I know the ending to their feud was tragic, but seriously, I been sick and tired of hearing about their feud.

There's a large amount of information covered here that can prove very entertaining to someone who doesn't follow rap, or to someone who is just brand new to it. The feature runs at a brisk pace and it's completely uncensored. My only issue is that at least one major feud was only glanced over, with no interviews from the two rivals at all, while another one isn't covered at all, which happened to be a pretty serious beef right there that actually spilled onto the street, with one guy claiming that dudes rolled up on his rival with burners ready to blow his a** away, as far as I know, he may or may not have sent that, but it was in his rhyme and if that was true then someone could have been bodied.",,1106.jpg,2003-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/beef/id279176703?uo=4,,60031004,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Beef/60031004,"Documentary,Drama,Musical & Performing Arts,Special Interest"

7257,Before Midnight,"We meet Jesse and Celine nine years on in Greece. Almost two decades have passed since their first meeting on that train bound for Vienna.

Richard Linklater made a triumphant return to Sundance with Before Midnight, the third part of his decades-spanning romantic saga that began with Before Sunrise (which premiered at the 1995 festival).

The film catches up with lovebirds Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Celine (Julie Delpy) on holiday in an idyllic Greek village, now middle-aged parents of twin daughters.

Co-written by Linklater, Hawke and Delpy, Midnight boasts an impressively high hit-rate of zingers but also digs new emotional depths, as past mistakes and Celine's neurotic temper threaten to put the brakes on the couple's relationship.

Exquisitely shot and intimately captured, this trilogy-closer is an impressive showcase for its stars matured performances, perfectly recapturing their spiky, back-and-forth dynamic. 

Director: Richard Linklater
Writers: Richard Linklater, Julie Delpy
Stars: Ethan Hawke, Julie Delpy, Seamus Davey-Fitzpatrick
","Yes, Jesse (Ethan Hawke) missed his plane at the end of 2004'sBefore Sunset. He wound up leaving his wife, pairing up with (but not marrying) Celine (Julie Delpy), and having twin girls. We meet the family at the end of a Greek vacation, with Jesse awkwardly packing son Henry onto a plane to Chicago, where he lives year-round with Jesse's ex-wife. The lovers have moved from infatuation to weary parenthood in between movies, and as Linklater observes their long ride from the airport back to their vacation house, full of low-level bickering about jobs and parenting, one worries the characters have forgotten how to talk about their inner lives.

Not so. Meeting up with their hosts and Greek friends for a final, leisurely dinner, they get philosophical about human connection in the digital age, about romantic commitment and ideals that might never have worked for anybody. Then they set off, just the two of them, through ruins and cobblestone alleys. Their friends have rented them a nearby hotel room and offered to watch the twins, and their trip to this romantic night together affords the kind of extended walk-and-talk pleasure that was so absorbing in the first two films.

Then comes the hotel, the start of some ""I still think you're hot"" sex...and a ringing cell phone. The fight that ensues is agonizing, with new scabs pulled off every time the anger seems about to subside. 

Before Midnight offers the possibility that the couple's odds-defying relationship will end in a one-day conflagration of pent-up resentment and parental guilt. The previous films' manufactured deadlines -- a train departure, a trip to the airport -- are no longer with us; the pair are now together until they decide not to be. Turns out, that's as dramatic as a ticking clock.",,7257.jpg,2013-05-24,,tUGwK4v1sOM,,,Drama

Still, the author manages to smuggle his work out of the country through friends, who arrange for one of his novels to be published in France.

1031,Before Sunrise,A French grad student named Celine (Julie Delpy) meets an American boy named Jesse (Ethan Hawke) on the Budapest-Vienna train. They get off the train in Vienna and hang out for a while.,"The film starts with Jesse meeting C‚àö¬©line on a train from Budapest and striking up a conversation with her. Jesse is going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the United States, whereas C‚àö¬©line is returning to university in Paris after visiting her grandmother. When they reach Vienna, Jesse convinces C‚àö¬©line to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her marriage and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked another guy, and this is a chance to realize that he himself is not that different from the rest; in his words, he is ""the same boring, unmotivated guy."" Jesse has to catch a flight early in the morning and does not have enough money to rent a room for the night, so they decide to roam around in Vienna.
After visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the Wiener Riesenrad at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, religion, and their observations of the city. C‚àö¬©line tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she ""loved him too much"". When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in Madrid, but they had broken up when she was avoiding him while he was there. He decided to take a cheap flight out of Europe, out of Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a Eurail pass and traveled around Europe.
When they are walking alongside the Donaukanal (Danube canal) they are approached by a man who, instead of begging, offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice in it. Jesse and C‚àö¬©line decide on the word ""milkshake"", and are soon presented with the poem Delusion Angel (written for the film by the poet David Jewell). In a traditional Viennese caf‚àö¬©, Jesse and C‚àö¬©line stage fake phone conversations with each other, playing each other's friends they pretend to call. C‚àö¬©line reveals that she was ready to get off the train with Jesse before he convinced her. Jesse reveals that after he broke up with his girlfriend, he bought a flight that really was not much cheaper, and all he really wanted was an escape from his life.
They admit their attraction to each other and how the night has made them feel, though they understand that they probably will not see each other again when they leave. They simply decide to make the best of what time they have left, ending the night with the implication of a sexual encounter between them. At that point, Jesse explains that if given the choice, he would marry her instead of never seeing her again. The film ends the next day at the train station, where the two hastily agree to meet together at the same place in six months as the train is about to leave.","photograph,ambiguity,unhappiness,suicide by drowning,religion,speculation,drink,simple gesture,father daughter relationship,dying,suicide,dancer,death,pinball machine,cow costume,drummer,goodbye,graveyard,cafe,reference to jesse james,surprise,ambiguous ending,witty,date,honesty,father son relationship,pigtails,american,card playing,fortune teller,sentimental,park,trust,palm reader,pretend telephone call,sunset,clever,actress,dog,fear,ferris wheel,record store,madrid spain,recording,cigarette smoking,drinking,cemetery,cow,pet peeve,fate,kiss,train ride,divorce,veterinarian,sorbonne,priest,german,budding friendship,architect,tourist,budapest hungary,explosion,harpsichord,street performer,natural,open ended,head over heels,song,sex,cat,train encounter,amusement park,railway station,crush,communist,liar,singer,alcoholic,listening booth,romance,plane crash,swimmer,honeymoon,simultaneity,underwear,paris france,feminism,sightseeing,trauma,drifting,sincere,horse and carriage,camera,promise,follow your heart,destiny,coincidence,london england,vienna austria,memory,escalator,husband wife relationship,eurail pass,45 recording,pregnancy,unrequited love,multiple perspectives,french,poetry,improvisation,journalist,wine,national geographic magazine,church,singing,airplane,flashback to images of memories,happiness,art gallery,time travel,twenty something,guitarist,bar,cross,holding hands,europe,fascism,hallucination,cable access show,theatre production,stardust,chance meeting,obsession,money,mother daughter relationship,brief encounter,waiter,long take,meant to be,star,humorous,marriage,quaker,lp recording,guitar,role playing,foosball,reading,hate,danube river,record player,love at first sight,love,beer,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,photographer,train,teenage girl,childhood,writer,anticipation,brother sister relationship,one word,great grandmother great granddaughter relationship,holding a hand,statue,fountain,tv show,bridge,catholic church,rainbow,rabbit,dancing,life changing decision,trolley,takes place in one day,harpsichord player,mother son relationship,restaurant,dialogue driven storyline,playboy magazine,poet,drum,motorcycle,poem,reincarnation,one night stand,skepticism,los angeles california,serendipity,bartender,held hands,tv newscaster,contemplative,book,family relationships,hotel,gravestone,lie",1031.jpg,1995-01-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/before-sunrise/id296765959?uo=4,5SbjL172kew,293391,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Before_Sunrise/293391,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"
2667,Before Sunset,"Nine years ago, two strangers met by chance, spent a night together in Vienna, and parted before sunrise. Now, they're about to cross paths again - in Paris -- where they will get the chance we all wish we had.","Nine years have passed since the events of Before Sunrise, when Jesse (Hawke) and Celine (Delpy) had met in Vienna. Since then, Jesse has written a novel, This Time, inspired by his time with Celine, and the book has become an American bestseller. To help sales in Europe, Jesse does a book tour. The last stop of the tour is Paris, and Jesse is doing a reading at the bookstore Shakespeare and Company. As Jesse talks with his audience, flashbacks are shown of him and Celine in Vienna; the memories of their night together have clearly remained with him despite nine years having elapsed. Three journalists are present at the bookstore, interviewing Jesse: a romantic who is convinced the book's main characters meet again, a cynic who is convinced that they do not, and a third one who, despite wanting them to meet again, remains doubtful they actually do. As he speaks with his audience his eyes wander to the side, and he can hardly believe it: Celine is smiling at him.
Once the presentation is over, the bookstore manager reminds him he has a plane to catch and must leave for the airport in a little more than an hour, and so just like in Before Sunrise, Celine and Jesse's reunion is constrained by time. As in the earlier movie, the characters are forced to make the best of the little time they have together, making it easier for their conversations to become ever more personal, beginning with the usual thirty-something's themes of work and politics and then, with ever increasing passion, approaching their love for each other, just as their time together is running out.
Early in their conversation, they broach the subject of why they did not meet as promised six months after their first encounter. It turns out that Jesse had returned to Vienna, as promised, but Celine did not, because her grandmother had suddenly died before the scheduled date of the meeting. Because Jesse and Celine had never exchanged addresses, there was no way for them to contact each other, which resulted in their missed connection.
As they talk, each reveals what has happened in their lives since first meeting. Both are now in their early thirties. Jesse, now a writer, is married and has a son. Celine has become an advocate for the environment, lived in America for a time, and has a boyfriend, a photojournalist. It becomes clear in the course of their talk that both are dissatisfied to varying degrees with their lives. Jesse reveals that he only stays with his wife out of love for his son. Celine says that she does not see her boyfriend very much because he is so often on assignment.
Their conversation as they traverse Paris takes place in various venues, including a caf‚àö¬©, a garden, a bateau mouche, and Jesse's hired car for his stay in Paris. Their old feelings for each other are slowly rekindled, even with tension and regret over the missed meeting earlier, as they realize that nothing else in their lives has matched their one prior night together in Vienna. Jesse eventually admits that he wrote the book in the distant hope of meeting Celine again one day. She replies that the book brought back painful memories for her. At one point, in the hired car, during a tense moment when Jesse is confessing his loveless, near sexless marriage, Celine reaches her hand out to touch Jesse but pulls back just as he turns to her.
In the concluding scene, Celine and Jesse arrive at her apartment. Jesse had learned that Celine plays the guitar and persuades her to play a waltz song for him. The waltz (written by Delpy) is revealed through the lyrics to be about their brief encounter.
Jesse then plays a Nina Simone CD on the stereo system. Celine dances by herself to the song ""Just in Time"" as Jesse watches her. As Celine imitates Simone, she playfully imitates Simone's voice and says to Jesse, ""Baby ... you are gonna miss that plane."" As the camera slowly pans in, Jesse smiles while nervously fidgeting with his wedding ring and responds, ""I know"", as the film ends.","dancing on table,dancing on the roof of a car,monk,scar,ambiguity,telephone number,unhappiness,attraction,politics,candle,lingerie,bookstore,prostitute,lost relationship,trappist monk,waking nightmare,suicide,dancer,death,drummer,academic masters degree,delicatessen,sequel,horniness,magic,editor,obscene finger gesture,cafe,surprise,death of grandmother,taxi,ambiguous ending,reference to thomas wolfe,explosive,running,cd player,father son relationship,american,france,marital problem,global warming,globalization,flashback,sentimental,park,violence,trust,boat,optimism,warsaw poland,marriage counseling,reference to moby dick,sacre coeur paris,reference to albert einstein,new york city,clever,bittersweet,cancer,second part,s&m,cigarette smoking,cemetery,fate,never let me go,band,manhattan new york city,vagina,self help book,jewish cemetery,waltz,spanking,umbrella,german,eiffel tower paris,tourist,budapest hungary,anger,memories,new york university,teacher,reunion,recurring dream,therapy,cd,aneurysm,hope,coffin,cynicism,song,cat,sadness,communist,texas,liar,sightseeing boat,singer,photography,heartbreak,strained relationship,bitterness,journal,author,simultaneity,paris france,condom,grandmother granddaughter relationship,spirituality,reference to god,sightseeing,time apart,sincere,metro,second chance,promise,imperialism,follow your heart,environmentalism,vienna austria,memory,catholic,school,wedding,pregnancy,sunrise,suffering,french,airport,penis,improvisation,journalist,helicopter,singing,happiness,depression,flea,nightmare,guitarist,picnic,jogging,catharsis,joy,pain,book signing,helicopter crash,publisher,paris,chance meeting,mother daughter relationship,brief encounter,cell phone,india,long take,meant to be,policeman,virginity,marriage,gun,broadway manhattan new york city,guitar,photojournalist,waitress,recurring nightmare,reading,reference to king henry iv,dissolving into molecules,tea,love,enduring relationship,seine river,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,police,photographer,book publisher,astrology,train,mundanes,writer,anticipation,torture,songwriter,thirty something,connection,one day time span,dream,chemical weapon,german occupation,second time around,monastery,friend,dancing,human rights,buddhist,like the first time,just like the first time,mother son relationship,restaurant,reference to nina simone,dialogue driven storyline,storytelling,notre dame cathedral paris,conservation,drum,deportation,disarmament,reference to look homeward angel,passion,manic depression,reincarnation,desire,loneliness,therapist,tense,sex scene,contemplative,book,following a dream,hotel,new beginning,lie",2667.jpg,2004-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/before-sunset/id295621095?uo=4,XvFosXeqmDg,60036229,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Before_Sunset/60036229,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"

2382,Beijing Taxi,"BEIJING TAXI is a timely, uncensored and richly cinematic portrait of China's ancient capital as it undergoes a profound transformation. The film takes an intimate and compelling look at the lives of three cab drivers as they confront modern issues and changing values against the backdrop of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. Through their daily struggles infused with humor and quiet determination, BEIJING TAXI reveals the complexity and contradictions of China's shifting paradigm.","BEIJING TAXI is a feature-length documentary that vividly portrays the ancient capital of China undergoing a profound transformation. The intimate lives of three taxi drivers are seen through a humanistic lens as they navigate a quickly morphing city, confronting modern issues and changing values. The three protagonists radiate a warm sense of humanity despite the struggles that each faces in adapting to new realities of life in the modern city. With stunning imagery of Beijing and a contemporary score rich in atmosphere, BEIJING TAXI communicates a visceral sense of the common citizens' persistent attempts to grasp the elusive. The 2008 Summer Olympic Games serve as the backdrop for BEIJING TAXI's story, a coming out party for a rising nation and a metaphor for Chinese society and its struggles to reconcile enormous contradictions while adjusting to a new capitalist system that can seem foreign to some in the Communist-ruled and educated society. Candid and perceptive in its filming approach and highly cinematic and moody in style, BEIJING TAXI takes us on a lyrical journey through fragments of a society riding the bumpy roads to modernization. Though its destination unknown, the drivers continue to forge ahead. -- (C) Official Site",,2382.jpg,2010-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/beijing-taxi/id478632645?uo=4,,70134643,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Beijing_Taxi/70134643,"Documentary,Special Interest"

2618,Below,"On what should be a routine rescue mission during World War II, the submarine USS Tiger Shark picks up three survivors of a Uboat attack. But for the crew  trapped together in the sub's narrow corridors and constricted spaces  the unexpected visitors seem to spark a series of chilling, otherworldly occurrences!","In the dark silence of the sea during World War II, the submarine U.S.S. Tiger Shark prowls on what should be a routine rescue mission. But for the shell-shocked crew, trapped together in the sub's narrow corridors and constricted spaces, this is about to become a journey into the sensory delusions, mental deceptions and runaway fear that lurk just below the surface of the ocean and deep inside the human psyche.

It's 1943 in the North Atlantic, and the U.S.S. Tiger Shark picks up three survivors from a British hospital ship that was torpedoed two days earlier; the discovery that one of the survivors is a German leads to violence; and, then, really weird things start happening, all the while a German cruiser is chasing the sub down. Is a ghost trying to destroy the sub and its crew, or are they just imagining things through convenient coincidences? 

Below offers up an intricate storyline that keeps both the characters and the audience guessing--when they and we aren't jumping out of our skins in terror. Twohy's direction is an example of economic brilliance--the flick charges forward, piling on the twists and scares methodically, but never gratuitously.

And what mood this movie creates! Ian Wilson's cinematography is vibrant and chilling, and the magnificent special effects never overwhelm the story--except for a final, hauntingly beautiful shot that will linger in your memory for quite awhile.

An added bonus is the cast of smart players: Bruce Greenwood as the sub commander trying to hold his crew and himself together; Matt Davis as the wet-behind-the-ears officer not really accepted by the crew; Olivia Williams as an English nurse who is both suspect and suspicious; and Holt McCallaney as a gruff officer.

3399,Beneath Hill 60,"As the Great War rampages across Europe, a brave platoon of tunnelers fight beneath enemy lines to defend an underground labyrinth packed with enough explosives to change the course of the war.","As seen in flashbacks that occur throughout the film, Oliver Woodward is an Australian miner supplying copper for the war effort. He falls in love with Marjorie Waddell, a young woman ten years his junior. However, he is under constant pressure to enlist, especially from Waddall's father. He has the opportunity to do so when the British Army forms the 1st Australian Tunnelling Company to supplement the Royal Engineers; Woodward is commissioned to lead the unit.
On the Western Front, Woodward meets Frank Tiffin, a young Australian soldier who is suffering from shell shock; it is later revealed that Tiffin, being underaged, was initially relegated to being a stretcher bearer, where he saw firsthand the horrors of war. Woodward reassigns Tom Dwyer and Norman Morris to relieve Tiffin. Two German tunnelers break through into the tunnel. Morris and Dwyer dispatch both of them, but Dwyer is killed when a German explosive goes off, burying the tunnel on top of them; Morris is rescued by the other sappers.
Later, Woodward is tasked to destroy the Red House, a fortified German position raining enfilade fire down upon the frontmost section of the British trenches. Although Woodward initially proposed tunneling beneath the Red House, his commanding officer, Colonel Wilson Rutledge, insisted that it be done by dawn. Along with Sgt. Bill Fraser and Morris, Woodward crosses No Man's Land. They manage to reach the Red House and plant explosives underneath it. However, as they make their way back to British lines, they discover that their fuse is too short, so Morris runs ahead to retrieve the exploder. While they wait, they discover mortally wounded Lt. Robert Clayton, who had been ordered to cut a gap in the wire for them. Morris arrives with the exploder and they destroy the Red House.
The next day, after a game of rugby, Woodward receives word that they are to be moved up the lines to the Belgium front. Upon arrival, Tiffin, Youngston, and Bacon are separated from the rest of the battalion and pinned down by German machine gun fire. Bacon, being the fastest runner, volunteers to distract the Germans while the others make a run for British lines. Although Tiffin and Youngston make it, Bacon is killed mere inches from safety.
The unit continues on to Hill 60. During an inspection, it is revealed that British forces had been tunneling deep below the Messine Ridge for months, planting a million pounds of ammonium nitrate in the form of 21 massive mines. Woodward is tasked with maintaining the tunnels as the British military buildup begins; they hope to fill the ridge with as many German troops as possible. To this end, he constructs a massive shaft to keep the water table from inundating the explosives. He also digs multiple diversion tunnels to throw the Germans off. Sneddon is buried in one such tunnel when he is ordered into it by Rutledge, despite reporting that the Germans would likely be setting off explosives soon.
The Germans eventually catch on to their plan and dig toward the main tunnel. An attack tunnel is dug in response, and the Australians successfully destroy the exploratory shaft with minutes to spare. However, the charge that was used weakens the clay and a portion of the tunnel collapses, trapping Tiffin. His compatriots race to stall the detonation of the mines, but the schedule could not be delayed on account of one man. Woodward sets off the mines to begin the Battle of Messines.","bleak,emotional,uplifting,tense",3399.jpg,2010-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/beneath-hill-60/id436317245?uo=4,uYOpCJCl5L4,70181731,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Beneath_Hill_60/70181731,"Art House & International,Drama"
3034,Beowulf,"In the age of heroes comes the mightiest warrior of them all, Beowulf.  After destroying the overpowering demon Grendel, he incurs the undying wrath of the beast's ruthlessly seductive mother who will use any means possible to ensure revenge.  The ensuing epic battle continues through the ages, immortalizing the name Beowulf.  Academy Award winner director Robert Zemeckis tells the oldest epic tale in the English language with the most modern technology, advancing the cinematic forum through the magic of digitally enhanced live action.  A stellar cast is led by Ray Winstone (""The Departed,"" ""Sexy Beast"") in the title role.  Joining him are Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins as the cursed King Hrothgar, John Malkovich, Robin Wright Penn, Brendan Gleeson, Crispin Glover, Alison Lohman and Oscar Winner Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother.","Beowulf (Ray Winstone) is a brave legendary Geatish warrior who travels to Denmark alongside his band of soldiers, which include his best friend, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson), in answer to the call of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), who needs a hero to slay a monster called Grendel (Crispin Glover), a hideously disfigured troll-like creature with superhuman strength, who attacks Hrothgar's mead hall, Heorot, whenever the Danes hold a celebration there, and he was forced to close the hall. Upon arriving, Beowulf immediately becomes attracted to Hrothgar's wife, Queen Wealtheow (Robin Wright Penn), who does not love her husband, and also takes interest in him.
Beowulf and his men celebrate in Heorot, in order to lure Grendel out. When the beast does attack, Beowulf attacks him unarmed and naked, determining that since Grendel seems to be immune to mortal weapons and carries no weapons of his own, armour and a sword would be pointless in the fight. Watching his reactions during the melee, Beowulf discovers that Grendel has hypersensitive hearing, which is why he interrupts Hrothgar's celebrations ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the noise they make is physically painful to him. Beowulf tears off Grendel's arm, and as thanks for freeing his kingdom from the monster that plagued them for years, Hrothgar gives Beowulf his golden drinking horn, which represents the time Hrothgar slew the mighty dragon Fafnir.
Inside his cave, the dying Grendel tells his Mother what was done to him, and by whom, and she swears revenge, travelling to Heorot in the night and slaughtering Beowulf's men while they were sleeping after the celebration. Hrothgar tells both Beowulf and Wiglaf who had been sleeping outside the hall at the time that it was the work of Grendel's mother, the last of the Water Demons, who was thought by Hrothgar to have left the land. Beowulf and Wiglaf travel up to the cave of Grendel's mother to slay her. Only Beowulf enters the cave where he encounters Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), who takes the form of a beautiful woman. She offers to make him the greatest king who ever lived if he will agree to give her a son to replace Grendel and let her keep the golden drinking horn. Beowulf gives in to her advances and returns, claiming to have killed her. Hrothgar, however, realizes the truth. He tells Beowulf indirectly that, much like Beowulf, he was also seduced by Grendel's mother and was Grendel's father. After unexpectedly naming Beowulf his successor as king, much to the dismay of his royal advisor, Unferth (John Malkovich), who was hoping to take the throne, Hrothgar commits suicide.
Years later, an elderly Beowulf is married to Wealtheow, who refuses to give him an heir since he had previously slept with the water demon. As a result, Beowulf takes a mistress, Ursula (Alison Lohman). One day, Unferth's slave Cain (Dominic Keating) finds the golden drinking horn in a swamp near Grendel's cave and, not realizing why it is there, brings it back to the kingdom. That night, a nearby village is destroyed by a dragon, which leaves Unferth alive in order to deliver a message to King Beowulf (which is ""The Sins of the Fathers"", revealing that the dragon is actually Beowulf's son born to Grendel's mother). Removing the horn has reneged on the agreement between Beowulf and Grendel's mother, who has now sent their son, the dragon, to destroy his kingdom.
Beowulf and Wiglaf go to the Cave once again and Beowulf goes into the cave alone. When Grendel's mother does appear, Beowulf throws the Golden Horn towards her in return for her not attacking the lands. Grendel's mother considers it too late for any kind of agreement and so she releases the dragon from the cave to attack Beowulf's Kingdom where it tries to attack Wealthow and Ursula. Beowulf goes to great lengths to stop the monster, going as far as severing his own arm, and ultimately kills the dragon by ripping its heart out. The dragon's fall mortally wounds Beowulf, but he lives long enough to watch the carcass of the dragon transform into its true form, the humanoid body of his son, before it is washed out to sea. Beowulf then shares words with Wiglaf and tries to tell him the truth, but dies before he can finish. Wiglaf dismisses his words as mere disillusions-although it seems clear from the earlier conversation with Beowulf outside the dragon's cave, where Wiglaf refuses to listen to Beowulf's confession, that Wiglaf is all too aware of the truth. Shortly thereafter, Wiglaf, the new king, gives Beowulf a Norse funeral and watches on the shore as the hero's body is taken by the sea, only to then witness Grendel's mother give a final kiss to Beowulf. Now it is impossible to pretend not to know the truth. At this moment it appears that Grendel's mother attempts to seduce him. Wiglaf steps out into the water, clearly tempted, but showing reluctance to follow her, as the scene blacks out.","exciting,stylized,rough,suspenseful,anticipation,fear",3034.jpg,2007-11-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/beowulf/id274059405?uo=4,6V0w1eYIXuo&hd=1,70061898,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Beowulf/70061898,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
7276,Berberian Sound Studio,,"In Italy, no one can hear you scream...

Timid and priggish, English sound technician Gilderoy (Toby Jones, excellent) arrives in Rome to apply his fastidious craft to low-budget horror movie The Equestrian Vortex. 

Once there, he finds himself trapped in a maze of cramped, windowless rooms, confronted by insurmountable language barriers, a tyrannical producer (Cosimo Fusco), a beautiful, hostile secretary (Tonia Sotiropoulou), a Kafka-esque expense- claims system and reels of overwrought images. 

Viewers are spared the ungodly sight of witches persecuted with red-hot pokers to genitalia. But Gilderoy certainly isn't, his contamination quickened by his own twitching hand as he sets about making all this violence sound as bad as it looks...

The sophomore feature of Berkshire- born writer-director Peter Strickland, Berberian Sound Studio, like Katalin Varga before, inhabits a twilight world between horror and art movie. But whereas Varga was a rape-revenge film reimagined via Andrei Tarkovsky, Berberian is love letter to, and deconstruction of, the lurid Italian horrors of the '60s-'80s. 

Without so much as a slash of (visual) violence, it unnerves even as it reveals the tricks of the trade: the droll sight of Gilderoy stabbing melons and wrenching the tops off carrots does little to alleviate the sense of dread slicking Gilderoy's descent into mental disintegration. 

A head-aching third-act shift, meanwhile, is pure David Lynch, sure to befuddle but thickening the nightmarish illogicality of the whole damn thing.

Naturally those familiar with their Argentos, Martinos and Deodatos will glean additional enjoyment, while the thriftiness and shiftiness encountered by Gilderoy evokes the mien of Rome's Incir De Paolis Studios, where many a genre masterpiece was shot.

But Strickland's nuanced, atmospheric, ambiguous movie transcends genre. 

Not familiar with the ornate death-dances of Mario Bava's Mask Of The Demon or Dario Argento's Suspiria? No matter, Berberian Sound Studio also recalls the claustrophobia of early Polanski and the crippling isolation of tech-twiddle thrillers such as Coppola's The Conversation and De Palma's Blow Out. 

Crammed with detailed craft, its appeal is further widened by dealing in universal fears: homesickness, identity, mental health. If you love movies, you'll love thi, oddly, it makes a perfect companion piece to The Artist, doing for sound what that did for silence.

Painstakingly recreating an era of full-blooded Italian horror, this niche-sounding yet accessible thriller confirms Strickland as a major talent.

Starring Toby Jones

1755,Bhutto,"Bhutto is an epic story about the first woman in history to lead a Muslim nation - Pakistan. TIME Magazine called Pakistan ""the most dangerous place in the world"" with good reason: the 6th largest country on the planet (population: 180 million), Pakistan is bordered by Iran, Afghanistan and long-time rival India, with whom it has engaged in a decades-long and smoldering conflict. Pakistan is ravaged by often violent internal dissent between various tribes and political factions. And Pakistan remains the world's only nuclear-armed Muslim nation. Benazir Bhutto was born into a wealthy family that has become Pakistan's dominant political dynasty. Often referred to as the ""Kennedys of Pakistan,"" the Bhuttos share a painful history of triumph and tragedy, played out on an international stage. Educated at Harvard and Oxford, Benazir's life changed forever when her father, Pakistan's first democratically elected president, chose Benazir, instead of his eldest son, to carry his political mantle. After her father was overthrown and executed by his handpicked Army Chief, Benazir swore to avenge him and to restore democracy - or die trying. Benazir lived a life of contradictions. She broke the Islamic glass ceiling, but was wed in a traditional arranged marriage to Karachi playboy Asif Ali Zardari. Her two terms in power saw acts of courage and controversy as she restored democracy, eradicated polio, helped advance the status of women, and fought extremism, all the while battling politically-charged accusations of corruption and cronyism. In 2007, with the country rolling in turmoil and under the thumb of yet another military dictator, Benazir was called back onto the world stage as Pakistan's best hope for democracy. With her assassination, she transcended politics, but left behind a legacy of simmering controversy and undeniable courage that will be debated for years.","BHUTTO is the definitive documentary that chronicles the life of one of the most complex and fascinating characters of our time.

2900,Biutiful,"This is the story of a man in free fall. On the road to redemption, darkness lights his way. Connected with the afterlife, Uxbal is a tragic hero and father of two who's sensing the danger of death. He struggles with a tainted reality and a fate that works against him in order to forgive, for love, and forever. Biutiful is a love story between a father and his children. This is the journey of Uxbal, a conflicted man who struggles to reconcile fatherhood, love, spirituality, crime, guilt and mortality amidst the dangerous underworld of modern Barcelona. His livelihood is earned out of bounds, his sacrifices for his children know no bounds. Like life itself, this is a circular tale that ends where it begins. As fate encircles him and thresholds are crossed, a dim, redemptive road brightens, illuminating the inheritances bestowed from father to child, and the paternal guiding hand that navigates life's corridors, whether bright, bad - or biutiful. -- (C) Roadside Attractions","More than any of the director's previous films including ""Babel"" and ""21 Grams,"" which came loaded with star power, ""Biutiful"" is destined for the art house. There it should enjoy a warm reception since its only star, Javier Bardem, delivers a knockout performance as a hero whose last days are detailed with Joycean elan, filled with ambiguity, contradictions and lyricism.
""Biutiful"" is the story of Uxbal, played by Bardem. He is a businessman of the underworld, yet a spiritually sensitive man responsible for the welfare of far too many living people and in contact with the souls of the dead. Most of all, he is a father.
Since his estranged wife Marambra (Maricel Alvarez) is a manic-depressive libertine, he has custody of his two young children. He lives in the Santa Coloma enclave of Barcelona, a neighborhood jammed with immigrants, many illegal, from Senegal, China, Romania and elsewhere.
Uxbal has his fingers in many illicit trades, from importing illegal Chinese workers to piracy and supplying goods to street peddlers. Grieving relatives call him in to help ease the transition of loved ones to the next life since he can communicate with recently freed souls.
Then Uxbal discovers he is dying of cancer. The diagnosis liberates him from his quotidian life, giving him at once greater insight and greater pain. He is a good man yet best intensions are not enough. Even his attempts to help the immigrants he watches over go tragically wrong.
Pressure comes from everywhere, from his wife, who so desperately wants to rejoin her family and reclaim a maternal role that ill suits her, to the Chinese sweatshop workers he protects, the cop he pays off and a Senegalese mother (Diaryatou Daff) whose husband has been deported.
Inarritu, who wrote the script with Amando Bo and Nicolas Giacobone, doesn't attempt to explain everything about his protagonist. It's up to the viewer to imagine how and why he chose such a life and who all the people in it are. Some are wise; others foolish. His children are often bewildered. Only the daughter senses, finally, that their father will leave them soon.
A real estate development forces Uxbal and his hedonistic brother (Eduard Fernandez) to disinter the remains of the father they never knew. In viewing the corpse, long ago embalmed in Mexico where the young man had fled Franco's killing machine, Uxbal meditates on the loss of a father's love and what that meant for him -- and will mean for his own children.
Bardem struggles to reconcile his impending departure with so much unfinished business and unalloyed guilt. Is this a punishment? Has he failed love so badly?
Inarritu captures his hero's state of mind and the subjective impact of events in his final days in the film's impressionistic storytelling. Gustavo Santaolalla's haunting music, from complex orchestrations to the melody in a single guitar, filters through the narrative, catching the emotions that bear down on Uxbal. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto paints Barcelona, in sunlight and shadows, as a city struggling with its many tragedies.","bleak,sadness,sincere,emotional,contemplative,atmospheric,surprise,gloomy,fear",2900.jpg,2010-05-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/biutiful/id434926068?uo=4,m_OrqZQV8p8,70117585,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Biutiful/70117585,"Art House & International,Drama"
2620,Black Gold,"Black Gold asks us 'to wake up and smell the coffee, to face the unjust conditions under which our favorite drink is produced and to decide what we can do about it. The film traces the tangled trail from the two billion cups of coffee consumed each day back to the coffee farmers who produce the beans.","The film focuses on the coffee growers of the Oromia Region of southern and western Ethiopia, the birthplace of coffee. It follows Tadesse Meskela, the General Manager of the Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union, as he visits coffee-growing regions in Sidamo and Oromia (including the Kilenso Mokonisa Cooperative in the Bure Hora woreda in the Borena Zone of the Oromia Region), as well as a coffee processing center, a coffee auction house, and his union's headquarters in Addis Ababa. He also travels to England and the United States in an effort to promote Ethiopian coffee by eliminating the numerous middlemen. There is also a scene where coffee farmers pray to God for a higher price, which was filmed at the Negele Gorbitu Cooperative, located near Irgachefe ¬¨√üin the Abaya woreda of the Borena Zone. The Ethiopian footage was filmed on two occasions (in 2003 and 2005), for six weeks each time.[1] The Ethiopian coffee farmers speak about their lives, with one explaining that he is cutting down his coffee plants and planting khat (a plant containing cathinone, an amphetamine-like stimulant) instead, due to the low price he is getting for coffee due to the explosion in coffee farmers across the globe, and the comparatively higher price he can get for khat.
The film also includes footage of the New York Board of Trade, a commodity trading floor in New York City, where the ""C"" international benchmark price of coffee is set each business day based on supply and demand, and explores the effects that these international prices (which by 2006 were at an all-time low) have on Ethiopian coffee growers. Other footage was shot at the first Starbucks and the World Barista Championship at the 2005 Specialty Coffee Association of America conference in Seattle; and at a caf‚àö¬© and the Illy coffee company in Trieste, Italy. These scenes stand in stark contrast to the footage of the impoverished conditions faced by the Ethiopian coffee farmers and their families.
Although Starbucks, Sara Lee, Procter & Gamble, Kraft, and Nestl‚àö¬© - the world's largest sellers of coffee - are mentioned in the film, all five companies declined invitations to be interviewed for the film.","mocha,pumpkin spice latte,caffeine,half-caf,wake up,liqueur coffee,espressino,caf‚àö¬© bomb‚àö‚â•n,ca phe sua da,irish coffee,yuanyang,farmer,cafe mocha,cafe zorro,mazagran,eggnog latte,fair trade,zebra mocha,coffee milk,caff‚àö¬æ latte,ristretto,cortado,white coffee,indian filter coffee,¬¨‚ä†black tie,decaf,soy latte,coffee,ethiopia,cafe nero,chai latte,skinny latte,guillermo,caf‚àö¬© touba,m‚àö¬©lange,espresso romano,economics,costa,chocolate dalmatian,kopi susu,caf‚àö¬© au lait,raspberry mocha,greek frapp‚àö¬© coffee,red tie,vienna coffee,iced coffee,frappuccino,turkish coffee,affogato,business,eiskaffee,starbucks,doppio,flat white,palazzo,nescafe,cappuccino,triple c's,color in title,breve,red eye,red tux,gal‚àö¬£o, stay awake,pocillo,caf‚àö¬©,macchiato,r‚àö¬∫desheimer kaffee,regular coffee,caff‚àö¬æ americano,black eye,caff‚àö¬æ marocchino,caf‚àö¬© miel,dirty chai,instant coffee,green eye,caff‚àö¬æ medici",2620.jpg,2006-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/black-gold/id412505376?uo=4,B7o1KKgLe9M,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"

In 1993, an elite group of American Rangers and Delta Force soldiers are sent to Somalia on a critical mission to capture a violent warlord whose corrupt regime has lead to the starvation of hundreds of thousands of Somalis. When the mission goes terribly wrong, the men find themselves outnumbered and literally fighting for their lives.","Action/war drama based on the best-selling book detailing a near-disastrous mission in Somalia on October 3, 1993.

1749,Black Rain,"Director Ridley Scott's international crime thriller stars Michael Douglas as Mike Conklin, a New York detective under investigation for corruption. When yakuza hit man Sato (Yusaku Matsuda) kills two American mobsters in New York, he's extradited to Osaka to face trial, with Conklin and Charlie Vincent (Andy Garcia) as his escorts. Mistakenly turning over their prisoner to yakuza disguised as police, Conklin and Vincent realize, after running down some blind alleys, that they have no chance of finding Sato in the unfamiliar city and enlist the services of Japanese desk cop Masahiro ""Mas"" Masumoto (Ken Takakura). While relaxing with Mas at a karaoke bar, the cops also get information on the world of the yakuza from Joyce Kinglsey (Kate Capshaw), a high-class bargirl. As they continue the search for Sato, the scrupulous, methodical, and civilized style of Japanese police work rubs the improvisational, rule-breaking Americans the wrong way. But when Vincent is murdered, Mas and Conklin realize that success will come only through a blending of investigative and cultural styles. The almost impenetrably sooty, neon-saturated city of Osaka is superbly photographed by future director Jan de Bont.","Two New York cops get involved in a gang war between members of the Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia. They arrest one of their killers and are ordered to escort him back to Japan. In Japan, however, he manages to escape. As they try to track him down, they get deeper and deeper into the Japanese Mafia scene and they have to learn that they can only win by playing the game the Japanese way.","crime boss,hit man,love interest,brutal violence,motorcycle gang,martial arts,yakuza,airliner,throat slitting,shotgun,semiautomatic pistol,cult film,cultural barriers,brawl,commitment,gun battle,motorcycle chase,suspense,blood,sunglasses,gore,sequins,action hero,street racing,blade,disarming someone,theft,cultural,chase,foot chase,showdown,personal,dishonor,stranger in a strange land,police badge,wooden sword,violence,foreigner,extradition,two man army,police detective,desert eagle,katana sword,fight in restaurant,suspenseful,severed head,machine gun,pistol,hand to hand combat,mixed martial arts,new york city,detective,fear,cigarette smoking,bust,cop,stylized,death of partner,stabbed in the hand,counterfeit,hitman,disguise,kiss,stylized violence,police,hostess,nightclub,friendship,tokyo,decapitation,shootout,head,anticipation,karaoke,murder,hero,culture clash,martial arts master,mafia,gang war,rough,trap,finger cut off,battle,anger,tough,osaka japan,friend,revenge,sword fight,ambush,neo noir,cultural barrier,gun fu,pump action shotgun,kendo,gunfight,restaurant,japan,sushi,internal affairs,motorcycle,counterfeit money,buddy cop,rain,f word,exploding car,steel foundry,parking lot,police chase,assasin,head butt,exploding motorcycle,martial artist,new york,fist fight,organized crime,blonde,samurai sword,gangster,blood spatter,chopsticks",1749.jpg,1989-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/black-rain/id270807103?uo=4,95-bc1DZovg,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
7323,Black Swan,"Nina (Portman) is a ballerina in a New York City ballet company whose life, like all those in her profession, is completely consumed with dance. She lives with her obsessive former ballerina mother Erica (Hershey) who exerts a suffocating control over her. When artistic director Thomas Leroy (Cassel) decides to replace prima ballerina Beth MacIntyre (Ryder) for the opening production of their new season, Swan Lake, Nina is his first choice. But Nina has competition: a new dancer, Lily (Kunis), who impresses Leroy as well. Swan Lake requires a dancer who can play both the White Swan with innocence and grace, and the Black Swan, who represents guile and sensuality. Nina fits the White Swan role perfectly but Lily is the personification of the Black Swan. As the two young dancers expand their rivalry into a twisted friendship, Nina begins to get more in touch with her dark side - a recklessness that threatens to destroy her.","Nina Sayers, a young dancer in a prestigious New York City ballet company, lives with her mother, Erica, a former dancer. The company is preparing to open the season with Swan Lake. The director, Thomas Leroy, has to cast a new principal dancer after forcing Beth Macintyre into retirement. Leroy wants the same ballerina to portray the innocent, fragile White Swan as well as her dark, sensual twin, the Black Swan. Nina auditions for the part, performing flawlessly as the White Swan, but not quite able to emulate the characteristics of the Black Swan. Although Nina does not do well during her audition, she approaches Thomas and asks him to reconsider her as the lead role. He tells her she is the ideal dancer to cast as the White Swan, but she lacks the passion needed to correctly portray the Black Swan. When Thomas forcibly kisses Nina, she displays a change of character and bites him, convincing him to cast her as the Swan Queen.
An intoxicated Beth angrily confronts Thomas and Nina. She is later hit by a car and seriously injured in what Thomas suspects was a suicide attempt. Nina begins to witness strange happenings. Thomas, meanwhile, becomes increasingly critical of her ""frigid"" dancing and advises her to stop being a perfectionist and to lose herself in the role. Thomas points to Lily, another dancer in the company, whom he describes as lacking Nina's flawless technique but possessing an uninhibited quality that Nina has not shown.
The relationship between the two dancers is tense because of Lily's indiscretions, but Lily invites Nina to a night out. Nina is hesitant at first but decides to go against her mother's wishes. At a restaurant that evening, Lily offers Nina a capsule of ecstasy to help her loosen up. Though reassured its effects will only last a few hours, Nina turns it down. Lily later slips it into her drink at a nightclub while she is absent. Nina returns home late, fights with her mother, barricades herself in her room, and has sex with Lily.
Next morning, Nina wakes up alone and late for rehearsal. When she arrives at the studio, she finds Lily dancing as the Swan Queen. Furious, she confronts Lily and asks her why she did not wake her up that morning. After Lily tells her she spent the night with a man whom she met at the club, Nina realizes she imagined the encounter.
Nina's hallucinations become stronger as she sees Thomas and Lily have sex in a backstage area and Beth stabbing herself in the face at the hospital with a nail file which Nina drops bloodied in the elevator. She has a violent argument with her mother, after which Nina passes out. Concerned about Nina's erratic behavior, her mother tries to prevent her from performing on opening night; enraged, Nina stands up to her mother and forces her way out of the apartment. Since her mother had called to say Nina was sick, Thomas assigned understudy Lily to take over, but reluctantly gives way when Nina insists on performing.
The first act goes well, until Nina is distracted by a hallucination during a lift, causing her partner, playing the Prince, to drop her. Distraught, she returns to her dressing room and finds Lily there. Lily announces she is to play the Black Swan. Nina shoves her into a mirror, shattering it. Lily seems dead but then she wakes up and starts to strangle Nina. She grabs a shard of glass and stabs her rival in the stomach, killing her. Nina hides the body and returns to the stage to dance with passion and sensuality. Sprouting feathers, her arms become black wings as she finally loses herself and is transformed into a black swan. At the end of the act, she receives a standing ovation. Offstage, Thomas and the rest of the cast congratulate her on her stunning performance. Nina takes Thomas by surprise and kisses him.
Back in her dressing room before the final act, Nina is congratulated by Lily, showing that their fight was imaginary. The mirror, however, is still shattered. She removes a shard from her own body and realizes she had stabbed herself. Dancing the last scene, in which the White Swan throws herself off a cliff, Nina spots her mother weeping in the audience. As Nina falls backward onto a hidden mattress, the theater erupts in thunderous applause. Thomas and the cast gather to congratulate her‚Äö√Ñ√Æonly to find that she is severely bleeding. As the white ceiling lights envelop her, she whispers, ""I felt it. Perfect.

325,Blade,"In a world where vampires walk the earth, Blade has a goal. His goal is to rid the world of all vampire evil. When Blade witnesses a vampire bite Dr. Karen Jenson, he fights away the beast and takes Jenson back to his hideout. Here, alongside Abraham Whistler, Blade attempts to help heal Jenson. The vampire Quinn who was attacked by Blade, reports back to his master Deacon Frost, who is planning a huge surprise for the human population.","A pregnant woman is treated in the hospital after being bitten by a vampire, but the doctors mistake the wound for an animal bite. They try to revive her, but she dies after they deliver her baby boy. The boy inherits the superhuman strength, speed, agility, endurance, durability, regenerative healing factor, blood lust, and enhanced senses of vampires, but does not suffer their weaknesses, such as garlic or sunlight. He grows up to be Blade, the vampire hunter.
Several years later, Blade locates a vampire rave club and kills most of the attendees, including the vampire Quinn, who he pins to a wall and burns. When police and fire crews arrive, Blade escapes and the police take Quinn's body to the morgue. As Dr. Karen Jenson carries out an autopsy with a co-worker, Quinn returns to life and attacks. Blade rescues Jenson from Quinn but is unable to prevent him from escaping due to police intervention. Blade takes pity on Jenson who was bitten by Quinn and takes her to his base. There, Blade and his mentor/weapons technician Abraham Whistler attempt to prevent Jenson from turning into a vampire.
At a meeting of the vampire Shadow Council, the vampire elder, Dragonetti, discusses Blade's recent intensified attacks, and berates Deacon Frost for his recklessness in running the raves. The established vampire leadership believes that vampires should try to co-exist with humans rather than risk a full scale war. However, the renegade faction led by Frost believes that vampires should rule the humans outright and harvest them like cattle.
When Jenson decides to go home, Blade warns her that, due to Quinn's bite, she may still become a vampire. At her apartment, she is attacked by a ""familiar"" - a human who serves vampires in the hopes of someday becoming one - and is rescued by Blade. After the attack they follow the familiar to a vampire library. Blade and Jenson come across an obese vampire named Pearl, who reveals Frost's research into vampire mythology and his plan to turn himself into an invulnerable vampire blood-god named La Magra. As Blade and Jenson explore, they are ambushed by Quinn and his gang. They manage to escape, thanks to the timely intervention of Whistler. Jenson offers to use her medical knowledge to cure Blade's need for blood.
Frost overthrows the vampire hierarchy, killing Dragonetti and taking the other members of the Shadow Council prisoner. When Blade leaves his hideout to obtain materials for Jenson's improved serum, Frost attacks. He abducts Jenson and has Whistler beaten and bitten, leaving him to turn into a vampire. When Blade returns, he gives Whistler a gun so he can kill himself.
Blade fights his way into Frost's lair but is captured. He is taken to the Temple of Eternal Night, where Frost intends to use Blade's blood and the sacrifice of the twelve pure-blood vampire leaders to resurrect La Magra and become the god's incarnation. Frost then intends to use the powers of La Magra to conquer the human race.
Frost throws Jenson into a pit, but she manages to escape. As the ritual begins, the trapped Blade is drained of blood, and the spirits of the Shadow Council are torn from their bodies to fuse with Frost, transforming him into La Magra. Jenson frees Blade and allows him to feed on her blood to renew his strength. Blade and Frost fight at the base of the temple, and Frost is killed. Jenson offers to continue working on a cure for Blade. He refuses, telling her that it would rob him of his Daywalker powers and render him unable to hunt vampires, so instead he asks her to make a better serum.","cool,scary,kungfu,mortal,martialart,garlic,monster,trust,kill,holy,prey,blood,teeth,vamp,vampire,immortal,vampirebloodcool,haayaa,killer,horror,evil,fear",325.jpg,1998-10-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/blade/id292720888?uo=4,cNEXUOoL400,5670311,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Blade/5670311,"Action & Adventure,Horror,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

Can they overcome mutual dislike, limited time to prepare, their coach's secret past, and the dirty tricks of their main opponents, the Van Waldenberg siblings?

Chazz has gained a lot of weight and is fired from a children‚Äö√Ñ√¥s skating show for being in a drunken stupor on stage. Jimmy's obsessive stalker, Hector (Nick Swardson), tells him of a loophole in the ban allowing him to compete in pair skating. In hopes of entering the upcoming World Winter Sport Games, Jimmy contacts his old coach, Robert (Craig T. Nelson), but is unable to find a partner. Jimmy's search for a last-minute partner leads him to Chazz, and Robert convinces the two to skate as the first-ever same-sex pairs team, because the regulations fail to state the genders of the pairs.
The reigning U.S. national pairs champions, brother and sister Stranz and Fairchild Van Waldenberg (Will Arnett and Amy Poehler), see the new pair as a threat and conspire against them. The pair convince their sister Katie (Jenna Fischer), whom they often take advantage of by reminding her that their parents died taking Katie to skating practice, to spy on the duo. In the process, Katie becomes acquainted with Jimmy and they develop a relationship. Although Chazz and Jimmy are initially disgusted by each other, they eventually develop a friendship. They compete at the United States Figure Skating Championships and earn a chance to compete at the World Winter Sport Games.
Chazz and Jimmy‚Äö√Ñ√¥s coach, Robert, informs them that to win, they will need to perform a technique that has never been performed successfully: The ""Iron Lotus"", an extremely complicated maneuver that Robert developed years ago. However, it is also dangerous: the only attempt of the maneuver was ‚Äö√Ñ√∫behind the bamboo curtain‚Äö√Ñ√π in North Korea, and resulted in the man decapitating the woman with his skate blade. Nonetheless, they decide to attempt it as Robert is convinced that two males would be better suited for the move because of the physics of a same-sex team (this is a parody of skating-themed film The Cutting Edge, where the conflicting main characters also decide to practice a dangerous skating routine). Fairchild commands Katie to disrupt the duo by having sex with Chazz, threatening to harm Jimmy if Katie does not comply. Katie invites Chazz to her room, and tries to seduce him. Chazz refuses, delighting Katie, but cannot resist grabbing her breasts. Jimmy witnesses this and is outraged at Chazz's and Katie's betrayals.
The next day, Chazz and Jimmy are both kidnapped and restrained by Stranz and Fairchild, respectively. Katie gets tired of her siblings and accepts that their parents were not properly safe while driving. While handcuffing Jimmy in a bathroom, Fairchild reveals that she and Stranz commanded Katie to have sex with Chazz yet she could not go through with it, due to her love for Jimmy. Chazz escapes but is pursued by Stranz through Montreal on ice and then through streets and stores. He tries to shoot Chazz with a crossbow, but accidentally hits the Winter Sport Games Mascot, Snowflake[2] Jimmy also escapes when a kid in the bathroom knocked down the bin which contains the key for the handcuff, though he had to use his tongue to drag the dirty toilet paper, as the key was on it.
Stranz and Fairchild perform their routine, a dramatization of the ""Forbidden Romance"" of John F. Kennedy and Marilyn Monroe. Both Chazz and Jimmy arrive in the ice rink just in time to compete. Chazz and Jimmy reconcile quickly and begin their routine, which has a science fiction theme. Fairchild, seeing the two doing well, throws pearls onto the ice. Chazz trips over a pearl and breaks his ankle, which renders him unable to perform his role in the Iron Lotus. Jimmy then offers to switch places with him. Although they have never practiced the other's roles, they perform it perfectly, with Jimmy's blade only cutting two small strands of Chazz's facial hair. Jimmy and Chazz win the competition, Jimmy reconciles with Katie, and Stranz and Fairchild are arrested due to the kidnappings and Snowflake‚Äö√Ñ√≤s shooting. Stranz and Fairchild begin arguing, then inexplicably kiss each other incestuously. Jimmy and Chazz receive the gold medal and fly off into the sky through rockets on their skates. While the credits roll, Hector is seen playing with dolls of himself, Jimmy and Chazz.","vision,joy,trust,why not,humorous,ice skating,impossible,skating,make it happen,hilarious,ice,ce,surprise",738.jpg,2007-03-30, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/blades-of-glory/id271407294?uo=4,bCg1HO4UbTA,70056446,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Blades_of_Glory/70056446,Comedy
7149,Blancanieves,"A twist on the Snow White fairy tale that is set in 1920s Seville and centered on a female bullfighter. ""Blancanieves"" ( Snow White ) (2012),a film directed by Herr Pablo Berger, is also a modern silent but, due to problems with financing such a bizarre film project, ""The Artist"" won the race to movie theaters. No doubt the two films will be compared in lengthy discussions complete with boring controversies which this Herr Von will leave to those interested in such trivial subjects.

""Blancanieves"" is certainly a fascinating, mesmerizing, modern silent film, and is inspired by the famous German fairy tale collected by Brothers Grimm; Herr Berger transfers the story to Spain during the 20s of the last century.

Deep Spain, namely the Andalucian a region, is the setting and we have a star bullfighter who will die tragically, six dwarf toreadors in a travelling show, a wicked stepmother and a helpless heroine who is looking for protection and love ( what a sad ending, MEIN GOTT!! ), By a twist of fate, ""Blancanieves"" is the best Spanish silent film ever made.
","Just imagine if Ernest Hemingway hooked up with the Brothers Grimm to write a screenplay based on the story of Snow White, and they got Francisco Goya to shoot and Tod Browning to direct. If that sounds cool, there‚Äö√Ñ√¥s even better news: Spanish filmmaker Pablo Berger has channeled all those energies through his own artistic sensibility and made one of the year‚Äö√Ñ√¥s most memorable, haunting films.
While this black-and-white silent feature has the misfortune of timing and comparison to THE ARTIST‚Äö√Ñ√Æas well as two other recent films about a malevolent queen hell-bent on the destruction of a fair young girl‚Äö√Ñ√Ærest assured: BLANCANIEVES (Spain‚Äö√Ñ√¥s official entry for this year‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Best Foreign Language Film Oscar, hitting theaters in New York and LA January 25) is its own thing. Set in the hot-blooded, violent and romantic world of 1920s Spanish bullfighting rings, magic castles and traveling carnival shows, the movie tells, in linear fashion, the tale of comely Carmen (played as a child by Sof‚àö‚â†a Oria and later by Macarena Garc‚àö‚â†a)‚Äö√Ñ√Æyes, her character name is a homage to the opera.
 
It begins in the womb. Carmen‚Äö√Ñ√¥s drop-dead gorgeous mother drops dead in childbirth, leaving her matador daddy Antonio (Daniel Gim‚àö¬©nez Cacho) heartbroken. So distraught is he, he can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t bear the sight of the baby. While Carmen is sent to live with her doting dancer grandma, Antonio marries the naughty nurse who attended his wife. Encarna (PAN‚Äö√Ñ√¥S LABYRINTH‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Maribel Verd‚àö‚à´) is more than just naughty, though: She‚Äö√Ñ√¥s downright nefarious.
When a chain of fateful events brings Carmen to live with Antonio and the wicked stepmother in the mansion of contrasts, she soon finds that living there could also mean dying there. She flees and winds up in a traveling road show with ‚Äö√Ñ√∫The 7 Bullfighting Dwarfs‚Äö√Ñ√π and finds her true calling‚Äö√Ñ√Æwhich is, of course, her family legacy. The brave beauty quickly rises to fame in the corrida under the stage name Blancanieves (Snow White). But her success as a toreador doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t sit well at all with evil Encarna, who‚Äö√Ñ√¥s got more than just a poisoned apple up her sleeve.

1218,Blood Diamond,"An ex-mercenary turned smuggler (Leonardo DiCaprio). A Mende fisherman (Djimon Hounsou). Amid the explosive civil war overtaking 1999 Sierra Leone, these men join for two desperate missions: recovering a rare pink diamond of immense value and rescuing the fisherman's son, conscripted as a child soldier into the brutal rebel forces ripping a swath of torture and bloodshed across the alternately beautiful and ravaged countryside. Directed by Edward Zwick (Glory, The Last Samurai), this urgent, intensely moving adventure shapes gripping human stories and heart-pounding action into a modern epic of profound impact.","It is 1999 and the troubled West African nation of Sierra Leone is ravaged by major political unrest. Rebel factions such as the Revolutionary United Front frequently terrorize the open countryside, intimidating Mende locals and enslaving many to harvest diamonds, which fund their increasingly successful war effort. One such unfortunate is fisherman Solomon Vandy (Djimon Hounsou), from Shenge, who has been assigned to a workforce overseen by a ruthless warlord, Captain Poison (David Harewood).
On a particularly tense morning, Vandy discovers an enormous pink diamond in the riverbank and buries it in the soft earth. Captain Poison learns of the stone, but before he can act on this knowledge the area is raided by government security forces. Both men are subsequently incarcerated in Freetown along with Danny Archer (Leonardo DiCaprio), a white Zimbabwean gunrunner jailed while attempting to smuggle diamonds into Liberia for corrupt South African mining executive Rudolph van de Kaap (Marius Weyers).
Having managed to learn of the pink diamond's existence, Archer arranges to have Vandy freed from detention. He then travels to Cape Town, meeting with his former military contacts, including Colonel Coetzee - an Afrikaner late of the apartheid-era South African Defence Force. Archer remarks that he hopes to abscond with Vandy's stone and leave the Dark Continent forever, but Coetzee indicates that his lost stake in Archer's botched Liberian operation entitles him to the diamond as compensation. The former returns to Sierra Leone, locates Vandy, and offers to help him find his family if he will recover his prize.
Meanwhile, RUF insurgents initiate an escalation of hostilities. Freetown falls to their advance while Vandy's son Dia (Kagiso Kuypers) is among those rounded up to serve as a child soldier under a liberated Captain Poison. Archer and Vandy narrowly escape to Guinea, where they plan to infiltrate Kono with an American journalist, Maddy Bowen (Jennifer Connelly), in exchange for giving her inside information on the illicit diamond trade. Coetzee and his private army also turn up in the region, having been contracted by local authorities to repulse the renewed rebel offensive.
While Bowen is evacuated with her story, the two men set out for Captain Poison's former encampment on their own. Dia, now stationed with the RUF garrison there, is confronted - although he refuses to acknowledge his father. Archer radios the site's coordinates to Coetzee, who directs an air strike via an Mi-24 helicopter gunship. Vandy locates Captain Poison and decapitates him with a shovel while attacking mercenaries rout the warlord's surviving men. Coeztee then forces a reluctant Solomon to produce the diamond, but is killed by Archer, who has deduced that he will have them both eliminated once their usefulness has expired. Dia holds them both at gunpoint, although Vandy convinces him of his own retained innocence and the two consummate their previous bond.
While escaping from Coetzee's vengeful followers, Danny collapses with a mortal injury and surrenders the stone to Solomon, instructing him to take it for his family. Vandy and his son rendezvous with a charter pilot, Nabil (Jimi Mistry), who flies them to safety while Archer makes a final phone call to Maddy Bowen, charging her to assist Solomon. He dies peacefully, fulfilling Coetzee's prediction that the smuggler would never leave his African home.
Shortly afterwards, Vandy, who is now living in the United Kingdom, meets with representatives of van de Kaap, who wishes to acquire his jewel. Bowen photographs the deal for publication in her article detailing the trade in conflict gems and exposes van de Kaap's criminal actions. Meanwhile, Vandy's guest appearance at a conference on ""blood diamonds"" in Kimberley is met with a standing ovation.","thought provoking,bleak,suspenseful,captivating,fear",1218.jpg,2006-12-08, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/blood-diamond/id293311376?uo=4,YG_a8lw512A,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

1901,Blood and Bone,,"Isaiah Bone (Michael Jai White) moves to Los Angeles, where underground fights are being held.One night, after watching a match involving local champion Hammerman (Bob Sapp), Bone makes a deal with promoter Pinball (Dante Basco) to get him into the fight scene for 20% of his earnings (40% if Pinball puts his own money on the line). On that same night, Bone encounters mob boss James (Eamonn Walker) and his girlfriend Angela Soto (Michelle Belegrin). It is revealed to Bone by Pinball that Angela was previously married, but James set her husband up on a triple-homicide, sending him to jail. When James learned that she was pregnant, he had her undergo an abortion. Since then, Angela has fallen into drug addiction.
Over the next few nights, Bone makes a name for himself in the underground fighting scene, defeating every fighter in his path and earning himself and Pinball thousands in cash. At the same time, he bonds with the people who live at his apartment building: Tamara (Nona Gaye) - the landlady who manages his apartment, Roberto (Dick Anthony Williams) - an elderly man whom he plays chess with, and Jared (Brody Lee and Cody Lee) - a young boy Tamara adopted after his father was sent to prison. Then, after making the once-undefeated Hammerman fall to the ground, Bone is offered a deal by James. The international underground fighting scene is run by a league of rich, powerful men known as the ""Consortium"", but mainly by a black market arms dealer named Franklin McVeigh (Julian Sands), and James wants Bone to square off against Pretty Boy Price (Matt Mullins), the reigning champion. Bone tells James he will think about the offer. Later in the party, James orders Angela to get acquainted with Bone in her room. Bone reveals to her that he was cell mates and close friends with her husband Danny (Kevin Phillips) in jail. Then one day, Danny was murdered by an inmate named JC (Kimbo Slice). Angela reveals that shortly after Danny went to prison, she gave birth to a son, but lost custody of him and does not know if he is still alive. Bone promises to bring her to her son, but sends her to a drug rehab clinic until she is ready.
The next morning, James offers McVeigh US$5 million to have him get the Consortium approve and schedule a fight between Bone and Price. That night, Bone discovers that Roberto has been murdered in front of the apartment, mauled to death by James' dogs because he witnessed one of James' street killings. Bone declines the offer to fight for James mainly because he never agreed to it; as a result, James orders his thugs to hunt down Bone and Pinball. James' bodyguard Teddy D (Ron Yuan) and his thugs head to the rehab clinic to pick up Angela, only to have Bone and Pinball dispatch them. Transmitting his location through Teddy D's GPS phone, James has the duo follow him to McVeigh's mansion. There, Bone is ordered by James to fight Price and win back his money, or else he will have Angela, Tamara, Jared and Pinball killed. During the conversation, Bone secretly records James' revelation that he had Danny set up and murdered through the GPS phone, which he transmits to Pinball's cell phone; Pinball then sends the video to the police. Bone faces Price, but at the point where he is close to defeating Price, he taps the ground and forfeits the fight. An infuriated James grabs his katana and attacks Bone, but Bone is thrown a jian by McVeigh's bodyguard to even the odds. Bone drops the sword and uses the sheath instead, beating James with it. In the middle of the melee, Bone blocks a sword slash, causing James to cut off his own hand. He runs off before the police arrive at the mansion to arrest James.
The next day, Angela is reunited with Jared. Tamara, who had threatened to kick Bone out due to his association with James, offers him to stay; he declines, saying he will only cause further trouble. Before exiting the apartment, he leaves her an envelope full of cash and asks her to take Angela in once she is rehabilitated. He also parts ways with Pinball, saying he has business to take care of.",,1901.jpg,2009-02-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/blood-and-bone/id327428822?uo=4,,70122364,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Blood_and_Bone/70122364,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

49,Blow,"A boy named George Jung grows up in a struggling family in the 1950's. His mother nags at her husband as he is trying to make a living for the family. It is finally revealed that George's father cannot make a living and the family goes bankrupt. George does not want the same thing to happen to him, and his friend Tuna, in the 1960's, suggests that he deal marijuana. He is a big hit in California in the 1960's, yet he goes to jail, where he finds out about the wonders of cocaine. As a result, when released, he gets rich by bringing cocaine to America. However, he soon pays the price.","The film opens to a young George (Johnny Depp) and his parents Fred (Ray Liotta) and Ermine (Rachel Griffiths) of Weymouth, Massachusetts. When George is ten years old, Fred files for bankruptcy and loses everything, but tries to make George realize that money is not important.
As an adult, George moves to Southern California with his friend ""Tuna"" (Ethan Suplee); they meet Barbara (Franka Potente), an airline stewardess, who introduces them to Derek Foreal (Paul Reubens), the main dealer. With Derek's help, George and Tuna make a lot of money. Kevin Dulli (Max Perlich), a college student back in Boston, visits them and tells them of the enormous market ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ and demand ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ for pot in Boston. With Barbara's help, they start bringing the drugs to Boston.
As the demand grows, they decide to start buying the drugs directly from Mexico with the help of a few minor Mexican drug lords. But two years later, George is caught in Chicago trying to import 660 pounds of marijuana and is sentenced to two years. After unsuccessfully trying to plead his innocence (by reciting the lyrics of Bob Dylan's ""It Ain't Me Babe"" and insisting that he did no more than ""cross an imaginary line with a bunch of plants""), George skips bail to take care of Barbara, who is suffering from, and eventually succumbs to, cancer.
While hiding from the authorities, George visits his parents back in New England. While he is having a heart-to-heart talk with his father, George's mother calls the police, who come and arrest him.
George is now sentenced to 26 months in a federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut. His cellmate Diego Delgado (Jordi Molla) has contacts in the Medell‚àö‚â†n cocaine cartel and convinces George to help him go into business. Upon his release from prison, George violates his parole conditions and heads down to Cartagena, Colombia to meet up with Diego. They meet with cartel officer Cesar Rosa to negotiate the terms for smuggling 15 kilograms to establish ""good faith"". As the smuggling operation grows, Diego gets arrested, leaving George to find a way to sell 50 kilos (110 lbs) and get the money in time. George reconnects with Derek in California, and the two successfully sell all 50 kilos in 36 hours, amassing a $1.35 million profit. George is then whisked off to Medell‚àö‚â†n, Colombia, where he finally meets the group's leader, Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis), who agrees to go into business with them. With the help of main middleman Derek, the pair becomes Escobar's top US importer. However, Diego resents George for keeping Derek's identity secret and pressures George to reveal his connection. George eventually discovers that Diego has betrayed him by cutting him out of the connection with Derek. Inspired by the birth of his daughter and chastened by a subsequent drug-related heart attack, George severs his relationship with the cartel and vows to leave the drug business forever.
All goes well with George's newfound civilian life for five years, until his wife Mirtha (Pen‚àö¬©lope Cruz) organizes a 38th birthday party for him. Many of his former drug associates attend, including Derek, who reveals that Diego eventually cut him out as well. The FBI raids the party and arrest George. Following George's conviction, he becomes a fugitive. Meanwhile, his bank account ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ heretofore under Manuel Noriega's protection in Panama ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ is seized. One night, he and Mirtha get into a fight while driving. They are pulled over by police and Mirtha tells them Jung is a fugitive and has stashed a kilogram of cocaine in his trunk. He is sent to jail for three years, during which time Mirtha divorces him and takes custody of their nine-year-old daughter, Kristina Sunshine Jung (Emma Roberts). Upon his release, George finds himself struggling to keep his relationship with his daughter on good terms.
George promises Kristina a vacation in California and seeks one last deal to garner enough money for the trip. George completes a deal with former accomplices but learns too late that the deal had been set up by the FBI and DEA, with Dulli and Derek having leaked the nature and location of the action in exchange for pardons for their involvement in his prior action. George is sentenced to 60 years at Otisville Correctional Facility in upstate New York. He explains in the end that neither the sentence nor the betrayal bothered him, but that he can never forgive himself for having to break a promise to his daughter.
While in prison, George requests a furlough to see his dying father, Fred. His unforgiving mother denies the request, saying a visit would only upset Fred. George is given a tape recorder to record a final message to his father. In the message, George recounts his memories of working with his father, his run-ins with the law, and finally, too late, his understanding of what Fred meant when he said that money is not ""real"".","stylized,atmospheric,captivating,gloomy",49.jpg,2001-03-29, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/blow/id285628573?uo=4,5-paYasDo2E,60020891,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Blow/60020891,Drama

Cindy also comes from a dysfunctional family, with her own mother and father not setting an example of a harmonious married or family life. One of her previous serious relationships was with Bobby Ontario, that relationship which has a profound affect on many aspects of her marriage to Dean. Dean and Cindy head off on an overnight getaway together without Frankie, the getaway which may provide a clearer picture if their marriage can survive its many issues. ","Dean is a young high school dropout, working for a New York City moving company. Cindy is a pre-med student living with her unhappy parents and caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. Cindy and Dean meet by chance and rush into marriage after discovering that Cindy is pregnant, both knowing it is most likely from her previous boyfriend Bobby (Mike Vogel). Before the wedding, Bobby, unaware of Cindy's pregnancy, finds and assaults Dean at his job.
This narrative of their courtship is intercut with that of a weekend some five years later regarding the dissolution of their marriage. By this point, they live in rural Pennsylvania and Dean works at painting houses while Cindy is a nurse. Though Dean is content with their life, Cindy believes he drinks too much and lacks ambition. In the hope of resurrecting their troubled relationship, Dean brings Cindy to a motel. As they go to the motel they stop off to get alcohol. As she is inside she sees Bobby and talks to him for a while. Bobby asks Cindy if she has ever cheated on her husband and she ultimately leaves after saying no. When she and Dean are in the car Cindy tells Dean about seeing Bobby and he is upset. During their trip to and at the motel they fight, but Cindy is called away early in the morning to work at the clinic. Angry that Cindy departed without telling him, Dean shows up at the clinic drunk, leading to an intense argument and violent altercation with a doctor, who fires Cindy over the incident. Dean tries to persuade her to give the relationship another chance, asking if she wants their daughter to grow up in a broken home, but Cindy says she does not want Frankie to grow up with parents who are so hateful to each other. Dean tries to embrace Cindy, but then we see him walking away from the house, though Frankie runs after him asking him to stay. Dean tells his daughter to go back to her Mom, and Dean keeps walking.","emotional,sincere,touching,stylized,sexual,bittersweet,gloomy",1872.jpg,2010-01-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/blue-valentine/id428798693?uo=4,sYgr_iGATB4,70122316,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Blue_Valentine/70122316,"Drama,Romance"
329,Blue Velvet,"The gruesome discovery of a severed human ear he found in a field leads a young man on a dark and dangerous journey into a dark and sinister underworld that exists in his hometown. 

A man returns to his home town after being away and discovers a severed human ear in a field. Not satisfied with the police's pace, he and the police detective's daughter carry out their own investigation. The object of his investigation turns out to be a beautiful and mysterious woman involved with a violent and perversely evil man.

Director: David Lynch
Writer: David Lynch (screenplay)
Stars: Isabella Rossellini, Kyle MacLachlan, Dennis Hopper
","Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) returns to his logging home town of Lumberton from Oak Lake College after his father suffers a near fatal stroke. While walking home from the hospital, he cuts through a vacant lot and discovers a severed ear. Jeffrey takes the ear to police detective John Williams, through whom he meets the detective's daughter, Sandy. She tells him details about the ear case and a suspicious woman, Dorothy Vallens, who may be connected to the case. Increasingly curious, Jeffrey enters Dorothy's apartment by posing as an exterminator, and while Dorothy is distracted by a man dressed in a yellow suit at her door (whom Jeffrey later refers to as the Yellow Man), Jeffrey steals her spare key.
Jeffrey and Sandy attend Dorothy's nightclub act at the Slow Club, in which Dorothy sings ""Blue Velvet"", and leave early so Jeffrey can sneak into her apartment to snoop. He hurriedly hides in a closet when she returns home. However, Dorothy, wielding a knife, finds him and threatens to hurt him. Thinking his curiosity is merely sexual and aroused by his voyeurism, Dorothy makes Jeffrey undress at knifepoint and begins to fellate him before their encounter is interrupted by a knock at the door. Dorothy hides Jeffrey in the closet. From there he witnesses the visitor, Frank Booth, inflict his bizarre sexual proclivities ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ which include inhaling an unidentified gas, dry humping, and sadomasochism ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ upon Dorothy. Frank is an extremely foul-mouthed, violent sociopath whose orgasmic climax is a fit of both pleasure and rage. Frank has kidnapped Dorothy's husband and son to force her to perform sexual favors. When Frank leaves, a sad and desperate Dorothy tries to seduce Jeffrey again and demands that he hit her, but when he refuses, she tells him to leave. When Jeffrey moves to leave, she asks him to stay, though he leaves anyway.
Jeffrey relays his experience to Sandy, who in turn tells him of a wonderful dream she had about robins that she interprets as a sign of hope for humanity. It is clear that Jeffrey and Sandy are attracted to each other, though Sandy has a boyfriend.
Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's apartment and she tells him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the Slow Club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends the next few days spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an industrial building that Frank frequently goes to. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank. Jeffrey tells his new findings to Sandy and the two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again and the two have sex. When he refuses to hit her, though, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.
Afterwards, Frank catches Dorothy and Jeffrey together and forces them both to accompany him to the apartment of Ben, his suave, dandy partner in crime who is holding Dorothy's son. Ben lip-syncs a performance of Roy Orbison's ""In Dreams"", sending Frank into maudlin sadness, then rage. Frank takes Jeffrey to a lumber yard and when he molests Dorothy, Jeffrey punches him. Frank's cronies drag Jeffrey out of the car and Frank kisses Jeffrey's face, intimidates him, and then savagely beats him to the overture of ""In Dreams"". Jeffrey wakes the next day at the same place and walks home, overcome with guilt and despair. He goes to the police station, where he notices that Sandy's father's partner is the Yellow Man ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ an officer named Lieutenant Detective Gordon. Later at Sandy's home, her father is amazed by Jeffrey's story, but warns Jeffrey to stop his amateur sleuthing lest he endanger himself and the investigation. Jeffrey and Sandy go to a dance together and profess their love, only to be confronted by Sandy's boyfriend. A confrontation is averted when the group finds a naked, battered, and distressed Dorothy on Jeffrey's front lawn. Barely conscious, Dorothy calls Jeffrey ""my lover"" and thus reveals her intimacy with Jeffrey, causing an upset Sandy to slap Jeffrey, although she later forgives him.
Jeffrey insists on returning to Dorothy's apartment and tells Sandy to send the police there, including her father, immediately. At Dorothy's apartment, Jeffrey finds Dorothy's husband, who is dead from a gunshot to the head and identifiable by his missing ear, as well as the Yellow Man, on whom Frank has performed a crude lobotomy. When Jeffrey tries to leave, he sees the Well-Dressed Man coming up the stairs and recognizes him as Frank in disguise. Jeffrey talks to Detective Williams over the Yellow Man's police radio, but lies about his location inside the apartment. Frank enters the apartment and brags about hearing Jeffrey's location over his own police radio. While Frank searches for him in the wrong room, Jeffrey retrieves the Yellow Man's gun and hides in the same closet in which he hid during his first visit to the apartment. Frank fires sporadically, killing the Yellow Man, and when he opens the closet door, Jeffrey shoots him through the head. Detective Williams, gun drawn, enters with Sandy a moment later. Jeffrey and Sandy now go ahead with their relationship and note the unusual appearance of robins in their town. A montage sequence ends the film, which shows Dorothy and her son reunited.","sexy,suspenseful,disturbing,sleazy,seductive,sexual,weird,atmospheric,anticipation,offbeat,captivating,fear",329.jpg,1986-08,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/blue-velvet/id364923162?uo=4 ,,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
1479,Bold Native,"Charlie Cranehill, an animal liberator wanted by the United States government for domestic terrorism, emerges from the underground to coordinate a nationwide action as his estranged CEO father tries to find him before the FBI does. The film simultaneously follows a young woman who works for an animal welfare organization fighting within the system to establish more humane treatment of farmed animals. Bringing their critically-acclaimed documentary style to a fiction narrative, Open Road Films weaves a timely story about those who risk their freedom for the lives of others.","A travesty of justice and decency going on that you can personally witness without traveling to Haiti or Chechnya or Darfur or wherever else in the world the newest humanitarian-crisis-du-jour is abrewing; something whose dark outline you can perceive by going no further than the nearest Kentucky Fried Chicken or IHOP restaurant. ""Bold Native"" deals with the Animal Liberation Front, the number one domestic ""terrorist"" threat on the FBI's list of bogeymen. The movie follows one ALF operative (played by Jaoquin Pastor) as he attempts to organize a simultaneously-executed, cross-country series of ALF raids on research laboratories and factory farms. Along the way we encounter other disparate members and factions populating the animal rights movement, from a conscience-stricken legislative lobbyist to latter-day hippies to an FBI snitch. Randolph Mantooth, the only professional actor I recognized in the film, plays the lead figure's father trying to rescue the son from his errant radicalism in a remarkably affective performance. We also learn about something called the Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act, overwhelminigly passed by Congress in 2006, which effectively equates people who rescue animals from abusive situations or sabotage the machinery of their torture with crazed jihadists intent on crashing airliners into skyscrapers! (Apparently, the ACLU lobbyists who assiduously watch over our rights and freedoms were out-of-the-office or too busy worrying about gay marriage laws to have noticed when this bit of proto-fascist legislation was being proposed and ultimately passed by all of 5 congressmen present in the House.)",,1479.jpg,2010-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/bold-native/id405427048?uo=4,,70185031,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Bold_Native/70185031,Drama
2752,Bolt,"From Walt Disney Pictures comes an animated comedy adventure featuring a super-dog named BOLT (voice of John Travolta), whose days are filled with danger and intrigue -at least until the cameras stop rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he begins his biggest adventure yet - a cross-country journey through the real world to get back to his owner and co-star, Penny (voice of Miley Cyrus.  Armed only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions - a jaded, abandoned housecat named Mittens (voice of Susie Essman) and a TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino (voice of Mark Walton) - Bolt discovers he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero.","A girl named Penny and a dog named Bolt star on a hit television series called Bolt in which the titular character has various superpowers and must constantly thwart the evil plans of the nefarious Doctor Calico. To gain a more realistic performance, the TV show's producers have deceived Bolt his entire life, arranging the filming in such a way that Bolt believes the television show is real and he really has superpowers. Mistakenly believing Penny has been kidnapped by the villain, Bolt escapes from his on-set trailer in Hollywood but falls into a box of foam peanuts and unknown to the film company is accidentally shipped to New York City. In New York, Bolt starts to notice that his superpowers aren't working, and rationalizes this is the effect that styrofoam has on his body. He then meets Mittens, a female alley cat who bullies pigeons out of their food. Bolt forces Mittens to help him get back to Hollywood, and after Bolt knocks Mittens unconscious the two start their journey westward on a truck. In Hollywood, Penny is deeply saddened over Bolt's disappearance but is convinced by the studio to continue filming with a Bolt look alike.
Surprised at his first feelings of both pain and hunger, Bolt is shown by Mittens how to act like a cute, but needy dog, and is rewarded by food. They meet Rhino, a fearless, TV-obsessed hamster and Bolt fan who joins their team. Rhino‚Äö√Ñ√¥s unwavering faith in Bolt substantiates the dog‚Äö√Ñ√¥s illusions about his superpowers, but Mittens, who has learnt that Bolt is from a television show, tries to convince Bolt that his superpowers aren't real. Bolt refuses to listen to Mittens, and instead becomes frustrated and attempts to superbark her repeatedly. The noise attracts Animal Control, who captures them both and transports them to an animal shelter. After being freed en route by Rhino, Bolt finally realizes that he is just a normal dog, but regains his confidence after Rhino (oblivious to this revelation) gives him a pep talk. They rescue Mittens from the shelter and escape, allowing them to continue their journey. Along the way, Mittens helps Bolt through his identity crisis by teaching typical dog activities (such as hanging his head out the window and chasing sticks), but Mittens refuses to go farther than Las Vegas. She tells Bolt that his Hollywood life is fake and there is no real love for him there. Her emotional rant reveals that she was once a house cat, but was abandoned by her previous owner and left to brave the harsh streets alone and declawed. Bolt refuses to believe that Penny doesn't love him, and continues on alone, wishing Mittens the best. Rhino, learning of Bolt's departure, convinces Mittens that they must help him, and the two set off to find Bolt once again.
Bolt reaches the studio and finds Penny embracing his lookalike. Unaware that Penny still misses him and that her affection for the lookalike is only a part of a rehearsal for the show, he leaves, brokenhearted. Mittens, on a gantry in the studio, sees what Bolt does not: Penny telling her mother how much she misses Bolt. Realizing that Penny truly does love Bolt, Mittens follows Bolt and explains. At the same time, the Bolt-lookalike panics during the show's filming and accidentally knocks over some flaming torches, setting the sound stage on fire with Penny trapped inside. Bolt arrives and reunites with Penny inside the burning studio, but they cannot get out. In desperation, and unwilling to abandon Penny, Bolt uses his ""super bark"". The firefighters hear the noise through the building's air vent and manage to rescue them before they succumb to smoke inhalation.
Penny and her mother subsequently quit the show when their agent attempts to exploit the incident for publicity purposes. Penny herself adopts Mittens and Rhino, and she and her family move to a rural home to enjoy a simpler, happy lifestyle with Bolt and her new pets. The show continues, but with a replacement ""Bolt"" and ""Penny"" ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ ""Penny's"" new appearance being explained in the show as being serious injuries necessitating her undergoing facial reconstruction surgery, and adopting a new storyline about alien abduction (one that even Rhino finds unrealistic, and Bolt finds ""ridonculous""). The epilogue scenes during the credits show Bolt, Penny, her mother, Mittens, and Rhino enjoying their new life together.","belief,hero,joy,trust,freidnship,determination,humorous,super,exciting,feel good,hamster,dog,anticipation,friend,superhero",2752.jpg,2008-11-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/bolt/id299891336?uo=4,shPGYLAOiz8,70099615,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Bolt/70099615,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Comedy"
128,Bombay Beach,"From Focus Features, the premiere global brand in original and daring cinema, comes Focus World. Charged with finding the most exciting voices in international and independent film, Focus World is proud to bring you Bombay Beach, winner of the Best Documentary prize at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival. Decades ago, the Salton Sea, two hours outside Los Angeles, was a tourist hotspot and a symbol of 1950s-era American optimism. Now, a victim of environmental decline, it stands mostly abandoned, its boomtown communities now decaying relics of a bygone era. Visionary filmmaker Alma Har'el investigates one such - Bombay Beach,and weaves together the stories of its inhabitants with surreal poetry and beauty. Set to the music of Bob Dylan and Beirut, this is the story of a place where the American dream has faded, but where the dreams of those that stayed behind are alive and well.
","The film uses an adamantly atypical and artistically innovative filmmaking to tell the story of three protagonists: Benny Parrish, a young boy diagnosed with bipolar disorder whose troubled soul and vivid imagination create both suffering and joy for him and his complex and loving family. CeeJay Thompson, a black teenager and aspiring football player who has taken refuge in Bombay Beach hoping to avoid the same fate of his cousin who was murdered by a gang of youths in Los Angeles. And that of Red, an ancient survivor, once an oil field worker, living on the fumes of whiskey, cigarettes and an irrepressible love of life.Together they make up a triptych of American manhood in its decisive moments, populating the Salton Sea's land of thwarted opportunity. The New York Times writes, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫[Bombay Beach] feels like a fever dream about an alternate universe. Suffused with a sense of wonder, it hovers, dancing inside its own ethereal bubble.‚Äö√Ñ√π[3]
Har‚Äö√Ñ√¥el explains about the film, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫This film can only serve to show glimpses into some of the larger issues one can pick out from these people‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lives and the way in which they live their lives in this particular place. All these things that can be perceived as wrong or right, or bad or good, all reside together, side by side. This is the human experience of life and that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s what I wanted to illustrate more than anything, how things co-exist, all the wrongs and the rights together, the love and the violence, the broken dream and the persistence of dreams. Even though the dream is broken, you can still see the people‚Äö√Ñ√π[4]
From Salon: ‚Äö√Ñ√∫You either like this kind of ambitious, brave, borderless experiment or you don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t, and I think it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s absolutely magical and tragic. Maybe it took a foreign-born Jewish filmmaker to make a movie that seems so positively biblical (‚Äö√Ñ¬∂) about the current conditions of America.",,128.jpg,2011-01,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/bombay-beach/id473902556?uo=4 ,,,,"Documentary,Drama,Musical & Performing Arts,Special Interest"

2896,Bonnie and Clyde,"Bonnie Parker is bored with life and wants a change. She gets her chance when she meets a charming young drifter by the name of Clyde Barrow. Clyde has dreams of a life of crime that will free him from the hardships of the Depression. The two fall in love and begin a crime spree that extends from Oklahoma to Texas. They rob small banks with skill and panache, soon becoming minor celebrities known across the country. People are proud to have been held up by Bonnie and Clyde; to their victims, the duo is doing what nobody else has the guts to do. To the law, the two are evil bank robbers who deserve to be gunned down where they stand.","In the middle of the Great Depression, Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) and Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway) meet when Clyde tries to steal Bonnie's mother's car. Bonnie, who is bored by her job as a waitress, is intrigued with Clyde, and decides to take up with him and become his partner in crime. They pull off some holdups, but their amateur efforts, while exciting, are not very lucrative.
The duo's crime spree shifts into high gear once they hook up with a dim-witted gas station attendant, C.W. Moss (Michael J. Pollard), then with Clyde's older brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and his wife, Blanche (Estelle Parsons), a preacher's daughter. The women dislike each other on first sight, and their feud only escalates from there: shrill Blanche has nothing but disdain for Bonnie, Clyde and C.W., while gun-moll Bonnie sees Blanche's flighty presence as a constant danger to the gang's well-being.
Bonnie and Clyde turn from pulling small-time heists to robbing banks. Their exploits also become more violent. When C.W. botches a bank robbery by parallel parking the getaway car, Clyde shoots the bank manager in the face after he jumps onto the slow-moving car's running board. The gang is pursued by law enforcement, including Texas Ranger Frank Hamer (Denver Pyle), who is captured and humiliated by the outlaws, then set free. A raid later catches the outlaws off guard, mortally wounding Buck with a gruesome shot to his head and injuring Blanche. Bonnie, Clyde and C.W. barely escape with their lives. With Blanche sightless and in police custody, Hamer tricks her into revealing C.W.'s name, who was up until now still only an ""unidentified suspect.""
Hamer locates Bonnie, Clyde and C.W. hiding at the house of C.W.'s father Ivan Moss (Dub Taylor), who thinks the couple ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ and an ornate tattoo ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ have corrupted his son. He strikes a bargain with Hamer: in exchange for leniency for the boy, he helps set a trap for the outlaws. When Bonnie and Clyde stop on the side of the road to help Mr. Moss fix a flat tire, the police in the bushes open fire and riddle them violently. Hamer and his posse then come out of hiding, looking pensively at the couple's bodies.",,2896.jpg,1967-08-04, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/bonnie-and-clyde/id272727813?uo=4,,19054266,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Bonnie_and_Clyde/19054266,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Drama"

2923,Boogie Nights,"Set in 1977, back when sex was safe, pleasure was a business and business was booming, idealistic porn producer Jack Horner aspires to elevate his craft to an art form. Horner discovers Eddie Adams, a hot young talent working as a busboy in a nightclub, and welcomes him into the extended family of movie-makers, misfits and hangers-on that are always around. Adams' rise from nobody to a celebrity adult entertainer is meteoric, and soon the whole world seems to know his porn alter ego, ""Dirk Diggler"". Now, when disco and drugs are in vogue, fashion is in flux and the party never seems to stop, Adams' dreams of turning sex into stardom are about to collide with cold, hard reality.

Reilly (""Magnolia""), Julianne Moore (""Children of Men""), Philip Seymour Hoffman (""State & Main""), Don Cheadle (""Talk to Me""), William H. Macy (""Bobby""), and many more.","In 1977, Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) is a high school dropout who lives with his father and alcoholic mother in Torrance, California. He works at a Los Angeles nightclub owned by Maurice Rodriguez (Luis Guzman), where he is discovered by porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), who auditions him by watching him having sex with Rollergirl (Heather Graham), a porn starlet who always wears skates. After a heated argument with his mother about his girlfriend, his sexual life, and his lack of direction, Adams runs away from home and moves in with Horner at Horner's San Fernando Valley home. After agreeing to enter the world of pornography, Adams gives himself the screen name ""Dirk Diggler"" and becomes a star because of his good looks, youthful charisma, and extraordinarily large penis. His success allows him to buy a new house, an extensive wardrobe, and a 1977 C3 ""competition orange"" Chevrolet Corvette Stingray. Dirk and his best friend/fellow star Reed Rothchild (John C. Reilly) propose and star in a series of successful action-themed porn films.
Assistant director Little Bill (William H. Macy) is married to a porn star who frequently embarrasses him by having sex with other men in his bed and in public. At a New Year's Eve party at Jack's house marking the year 1980, he shoots both her and her lover, then turns the gun on himself.
Jack's porn empire struggles after his main source of funding, the Colonel, is imprisoned for possession of child pornography. His new financier, Floyd Gondolli, insists on cutting costs by shooting on videotape, a format that Jack detests. He is also unhappy with the lack of scripts and character development in the projects Gondolli expects him to churn out as quickly as possible. One of these projects involves him and Rollergirl, riding in a limousine searching for random men for her to have sex with while a crew tapes it. When a man recognizes Rollergirl as a former high school classmate, he insults both her and Jack. They beat him and leave him bleeding and half-conscious on the street.
Leading lady Amber Waves (Julianne Moore), who took Eddie under her wing when he joined Jack's stable of actors, finds herself in a custody battle for her young son with her former husband. The court determines she is an unfit mother due to her involvement in the porn industry, prior criminal record, and cocaine addiction.
Buck Swope (Don Cheadle) marries fellow porn star Jessie St. Vincent, who shortly thereafter becomes pregnant. Because of his involvement in the porn industry, Buck is denied a bank loan to open a stereo equipment store. He stops at a donut shop and finds himself in the middle of a holdup. The clerk, the thief, and an armed customer are killed in the crossfire. Buck, the sole survivor, escapes with the money and uses it to finance his store.
Dirk becomes addicted to cocaine and methamphetamine; consequently, he finds it increasingly difficult to achieve an erection, and he falls into violent mood swings. After he has a falling out with Jack during a film shoot, he and Reed decide to pursue their dream of rock and roll stardom, a move supported by Scotty, a gay boom operator who is in love with Dirk. However, they squander their money, leaving themselves unable to pay the recording studio for the demo tapes. Desperate for money, Dirk resorts to prostitution, but he is assaulted and robbed by a gang of thugs. Dirk, Reed, and their friend Todd attempt to scam drug dealer Rahad Jackson by selling him a half-kilo of baking soda disguised as cocaine. The sale seems to have been executed smoothly, but Todd unexpectedly tries to rob Rahad, and is killed in the ensuing gunfight. Frightened by his brush with death, Dirk tearfully reconciles with Jack. By 1984, Amber, Rollergirl, and Dirk, now living in Jack's house, prepare to shoot a film.","sexual,sentimental,surprise,captivating,touching",2923.jpg,1997-09-11, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/boogie-nights/id345892608?uo=4,9VK0kRp8ozI,1180077,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Boogie_Nights/1180077,"Comedy,Drama"
2091,Booker's Place: A Mississippi Story,"In 1965, filmmaker Frank De Felitta made a documentary film for NBC News about the changing times in the American South and the tensions of life in the Mississippi Delta during the civil rights struggle. The film was broadcast in May of 1966 and outraged many Southern viewers, in part, because it included an extraordinary scene featuring a local African-American waiter named Booker Wright. Wright, who worked at a local ""whites only"" restaurant in Greenwood MS, went on record to deliver a stunning, heartfelt and inflammatory monologue exploding the myth about who he was and how he felt about his position serving the local white community. The fallout for Booker Wright was extreme: He lost his job, and was beaten and ostracized by those that considered him ""one of their own."" Forty-five years after Booker's television appearance, Frank De Felitta's son, director Raymond De Felitta, takes a journey into the Mississippi Yazoo Delta with Booker Wright's granddaughter in search of who Booker Wright was, the mystery surrounding his courageous life and untimely murder, and the role Frank De Felitta's NBC News documentary may have played in it.","In 1965, documentary filmmaker Frank DeFelitta traveled to Mississippi to shoot a film on the subject of racism in the American South. As he went about observing life in Mississippi and interviewing the locals, Frank was introduced to an African-American waiter named Booker Wright. With utter candor and a brazen lack of concern for his own well-being, Booker appeared on tape in the documentary and spoke openly and honestly about the realities of living in a racist society. This brief interview forever changed the lives of Booker and his family, and more than 40 years later, Frank's son Raymond DeFelitta (director of City Island) returns to the site of his father's film to examine the repercussions of this fateful interview. -- (C) Tribeca",,2091.jpg,2012-04-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/bookers-place-mississippi/id512305729?uo=4,wsjD8YofTv4,70236765,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Booker_s_Place_A_Mississippi_Story/70236765,"Documentary,Special Interest,Television"

Kennedy's inaugural address, which later inspires him to enlist in the Marines.
After Ron Kovic and his classmates hear an impassioned lecture about the Marine Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom because he is unable to secure a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.
The film then moves to Kovic's second Vietnam tour in October 1967. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, named Wilson. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsmen present who try to save him, Wilson later dies from his wounds, leaving a deep impression on Kovic. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO.
The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol in January 1968. During a firefight, Kovic is critically wounded and trapped in a field facing sure death, until a fellow Marine rescues him. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months recovering at the Bronx Veterans Administration hospital. The hospital living conditions are deplorable: rats crawl freely on the floors, the staff is generally apathetic to their patients' needs, doctors visit the patients infrequently, drug use is rampant (among both the staff and patients), and equipment is too old and ill-maintained to be useful. He desperately tries to walk again with the use of crutches and braces, despite repeated warnings from his doctors. However, he soon suffers a bad fall that causes a compound fracture of his femur. The injury nearly robs him of his leg, and he vehemently argues with the doctors who briefly consider resorting to amputation.
Ron returns home, permanently in a wheelchair, with his leg intact. From the start, he notices how all his family and friends treat him differently now that he is paralyzed. He begins to alienate his family and friends, complaining about students staging anti-war rallies across the country and burning the American flag. Though he tries to maintain his dignity as a Marine, Ron gradually becomes disillusioned, feeling the effects of his paralysis on his life, and realizes that all the things he was taught from birth, like honor, patriotism, and courage, were illusions which he would give up any day to get his legs back. In Ron's absence, his younger brother Tommy has already become staunchly anti-war, remarking to Ron directly in his face what the war had done to him, leading to a rift between them. His highly religious mother also seems unable to deal with Ron's new attitude as a resentful, paralyzed veteran. His problems are as much psychological as they are physical and he quickly becomes alcoholic and belligerent. During an Independence Day parade, he shows signs of post-traumatic stress when firecrackers explode and when a baby in the crowd starts crying. He reunites with his old high school friend, Timmy Burns, who is also a wounded veteran, and the two spend Ron's birthday sharing war stories. Later, Ron goes to visit Donna at her college in Syracuse, New York. The two reminisce and she asks him to attend a vigil for the victims of the Kent State shootings. However, he cannot do so, because his chair prevents him from getting very far on campus because of curbs and stairways. He and Donna are separated after she and her fellow students are captured and taken away by the police at her college for demonstrating a protest against the Vietnam War.
After returning home drunk one night after having a barroom confrontation with a World War II veteran who expresses no sympathy to Ron, Ron's disillusionment grows severe enough that he has an intense fight with his mother, yelling at her that there was no God, and that they murdered civilians in Vietnam in disregard of Christian morals. Ron travels to a small town in Mexico (""The Village of the Sun"") that seems to be a haven for paralyzed Vietnam veterans. He has his first sexual experience with a prostitute he believes he's in love with. Ron wants to ask her to marry him but when he sees her with another customer, the realization of real love versus a mere physical sexual experience sets in, and he decides against it. Hooking up with another wheelchair-using veteran, Charlie, who is furious over a prostitute's mocking his lack of sexual function due to his paralysis, the two travel to what they believe will be a friendlier village. After annoying their taxicab driver, they end up stranded on the side of the road. They quarrel and fight about what each of them had really done in Vietnam, knocking each other out of their wheelchairs. Eventually, they are picked up by a man with a truck and eventually driven back to the ""Village of the Sun"". On his way back to Long Island, Ron makes a side trek to Georgia to visit the parents and family of Wilson, the Marine he accidentally killed during his tour. He tells them the real story about how their son died and confesses his guilt to them. Wilson's widow, now the mother of the deceased Marine's toddler son, admits that she cannot find it in her heart to forgive him for killing her husband, but adds that maybe God can. Wilson's parents, however, are more forgiving and even sympathetic to his predicament and suffering, because Wilson's father fought in the Pacific Theater during World War II and is disillusioned with the war in Vietnam. In spite of the mixed reactions he receives, the confession seems to lift a heavy weight from Ron's conscience.
Ron joins Vietnam Veterans Against the War (VVAW) and travels to the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami. He and his compatriots force their way into the convention hall during Richard Nixon's acceptance speech and cause a commotion that makes it onto the national news. Ron himself tells a reporter about his negative experiences in Vietnam and the VA hospital conditions, that the Vietnam war is wrong, and tells him that the Vietnamese people are a proud people fighting against the US for their independence, fueling rage from the surrounding Nixon supporters. His interview is cut short when guards eject him and his fellow vets from the hall and attempt to turn them over to the police. They manage to break free from the police, regroup, and charge the hall again, though not so successfully this time. The film ends with Kovic's speaking at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, shortly after the publication of his autobiography, Born on the Fourth of July.","bleak,sadness,sincere,disturbing,emotional,intense,thought provoking,disabled,captivating,gloomy,fear",1662.jpg,1989-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/born-on-the-fourth-of-july/id279966845?uo=4,t8NR6n1nRMI,,,Drama
2784,Boundin',"In the not too distant past, a lamb lives in the desert plateau just below the snow line. He is proud of how bright and shiny his coat of wool is, so much so that it makes him want to dance, which in turn makes all the other creatures around him also want to dance. His life changes when one spring day he is captured, his wool shorn, and thrown back out onto the plateau all naked and pink. But a bounding jackalope who wanders by makes the lamb look at life a little differently in seeing that there is always something exciting in life to bound about. ","The film features a sheep that lived in the American West whose elegant dancing is very popular with the other animals. One day the sheep-shearers arrive and shear it for wool. Having lost his coat, the sheep becomes shy and loses the confidence to dance so elegantly. It is whilst in his bare state that a benevolent jackalope comes across the little lamb and teaches him the merits of ""bounding"" rather than dancing (that is, getting up whenever you fall down). The sheep is converted and its joy in life is restored. The sheep's wool eventually grows back in the winter, only for it to be cut again, but his pride is now completely unshaken and he continues to ""bound"". It is also implied that the jackalope has helped other animals before the sheep.",,2784.jpg,2003-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/boundin/id81758680?uo=4,,,,"Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family,Musical & Performing Arts,Special Interest"
1925,Box Elder,"Box elder bugs are loud, scary looking, and dependent on group swarming. Yet, they're also completely harmless and extremely passive aggressive. Using this metaphor to address a generation that thinks big, talks fast, and threatens to change the world, Box Elder is an unapologetic portrait of a youth movement at odds with its own ambivalence, exposing a generation defined by privilege, potential, and self-induced paralysis. The film follows four best friends through their last years of college. Dependant on their parents financially, and on each other emotionally, they spend their time sleeping in, hanging out, and eating lots of sandwiches. Using break-ups and re-occurring scholastic failures to impose a quarter-life crisis, they take turns postponing responsibility, avoiding accountability, and looking for someone or something to substantiate their lives, all the while hedging their bets and mastering the art of treading water and getting away with it. It's a collegiate love letter.","Box Elder follows best friends and roommates, John Scott (Sklar) Alex, Nick, and Chad (Haas) through their final years of college at the University of Missouri. The loose narrative structure is anchored by John's breakup with his girlfriend Laura (Hina Abdullah).

7330,Boy,"Set on the east coast of New Zealand in the year 1984, Boy, an 11-year-old kid and devout Michael Jackson fan gets a chance to know his father, who has returned to find a bag of money he buried years ago.

It's 1984, and Michael Jackson is king-even in Waihau Bay, New Zealand. Here we meet Boy, an 11-year-old who lives on a farm with his gran, a goat, and his younger brother, Rocky (who thinks he has magic powers). Shortly after Gran leaves for a week, Boy's father, Alamein, appears out of the blue. Having imagined a heroic version of his father during his absence, Boy comes face to face with the real version-an incompetent hoodlum who has returned to find a bag of money he buried years before. This is where the goat enters. 

Director: Taika Waititi
Writer: Taika Waititi
Stars: James Rolleston, Te Aho Aho Eketone-Whitu, Taika Waititi","The year is 1984.

Boy spends his time dreaming of Michael Jackson and his estranged father, Alamein, who has since left him and Rocky. Boy continually creates stories about his father such as him escaping prison and taking him to see Michael Jackson live. Even though Boy continues to believe this, friends and bullies never believe him anyway, which starts a fight between him and another classmate, Kingi, and his older brother. When Boy's grandmother leaves for a funeral one day, Boy takes charge of the house and his brother and cousins but is then surprised to see his father and two other men arrive at the farm.
Boy and the others are happy to see Alamein return but Rocky is displeased at their father's sudden reappearance. It seems at first that Alamein is here to finally be in his sons' lives but it is soon revealed that he is actually back to find a bag of money he had buried before being arrested by the police. With his two henchmen, he begins to dig up the money in a nearby field he had buried it at but has trouble remembering the exact spot. Boy sees this and offers to help and Alamein soon decides to hang out with Boy and be a father. The two have fun such as going on drives in Alamein's car and getting revenge on Boy's bully and the bully's brother. Meanwhile, Alamein has no luck with digging up the money and decides to go in the business of marijuana after he discovers Boy bring some from helping his friends pick. Boy leads his father to the stalks of marijuana and after gathering enough, they head to see Boy's friend Dynasty's father, who deals with pot. As Alamein and his men give the details of the plan to Dynasty's father, he attacks them with his buddies and beats them up. Even though this happens, Boy sees his father doing a fighting dance sequence with the others, still seeing the best in him.
Boy continues to dig for the money and one day he successfully finds the treasure but is overcome with the amount. This leads Boy to treat his friends with popsicles and candy from his aunt's store but Alamein comes and angrily questions and hits Boy into revealing where he got the money. Boy's Aunt Gracey stops him and yells at Alamein to leave Boy alone and he soon leaves with Boy standing shamed. Boy later visits back at the farm to check on the spot where he hid the money; his goat's pen. He is devastated though to find the money eaten by the goat. Also, Alamein's men decide to leave him and take the car as his plans continue to fail. Boy starts drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana due to his stress and the fact that he finally understands that his father is not as great as he thought. After getting over his stress and sadness, he returns home to clean the house and put his cousins to sleep. Alamein sits up depressed in the barn and is visited by Rocky and finally sits to comfort him. Just then, Boy comes in and begins to hit his father in anger but Alamein stops his crying son who then goes back to the house.
Boy and Rocky visit their mother's grave the next day to find Alamein sitting there, staring at the grave. It was also revealed before in the film that their mother had died after giving birth to Rocky which was a reason why Alamein had also left before. The final scene of the film shows the boys silently joining Alamein as they sit around the grave.",,7330.jpg,2010-03-25,,,70129389,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Boy/70129389,"Drama,Comedy"

But the fact that the latter was a non-speaking killer bear proved the difference between the two. Merida was a poster girl for archery as the cinematic ladies' hobby of choice.

OK, so tomboy Merida (nimbly voiced by Kelly Macdonald) does feel something of an amalgam, saddled as she is with Mulan's independent streak, Jessie the Cowgirl's pluck and the archery prowess of Katniss Everdeen. Boldly though, this is one Disney princess who refuses to be defined by a Prince Charming, for all her mother's attempts to set her up with one in the interests of Highland tribal harmony.

Voiced by Emma Thompson, the stately Queen Elinor fills much the same role as Marlin in Finding Nemo: namely, overprotective parental buzz-kill forever trying to keep their mischievous offspring in check. (As well as Merida, she and the burly King Fergus - the easiest of paydays for Billy Connolly - have a trio of unruly boy triplets wreaking havoc in their castle.)

It's evident from the off, then, that much of Brave's drama will be driven by its stern mother/headstrong daughter dynamic, and the friction therein. But how this dynamic develops hangs on a bonkers plot twist that's so off the wall and out of left field it almost capsizes the entire movie.

More lukewarm haggis than piping-hot broth, Pixar's 13th feature might fall short, but is still head and hair-covered shoulders above most of its CG competitors.

1982,Braveheart,"William Wallace is a Scottish rebel who leads an uprising against the cruel English ruler Edward the Longshanks, who wishes to inherit the crown of Scotland for himself. When he was a young boy, William Wallace's father and brother, along with many others, lost their lives trying to free Scotland. Once he loses another of his loved ones, William Wallace begins his long quest to make Scotland free once and for all, along with the assistance of Robert the Bruce.","In 1280, after several years of political unrest, Scotland is invaded and conquered by King Edward I of England (called ""Longshanks"" for his height - 6' 2"") (Patrick McGoohan).
Young William Wallace witnesses the treachery of Longshanks, survives the death of his father and brother, and is taken abroad by his uncle where he is educated. Years later, Longshanks grants his noblemen land and privileges in Scotland, including ius primae noctis, the right of the lord to take a newly married Scottish woman into his bed for sexual liberties on her wedding night. When he returns home, Wallace (Mel Gibson) falls in love with his childhood sweetheart, Murron MacClannough (Catherine McCormack), and they marry in secret so that she does not have to spend a night in the bed of the English lord.
When an English soldier tries to rape Murron, Wallace fights off several soldiers and the two attempt to flee. But Murron is captured and publicly executed by having her throat slit by the sheriff, who proclaims ""an assault on the King's soldiers is the same as an assault on the King himself."" In retribution, Wallace and several villagers slaughter the English garrison and execute the sheriff. In addition, he goes to an English military stronghold near Lanark, allows one of the villagers to avenge his wife's sexual shaming from an English lord, and sends the occupying English garrison back to England. This enrages Longshanks, who confronts his son Edward about this: he then orders his son to stop Wallace by any means necessary. He also knows his son has a bisexual relationship going with his French wife Isabella (Sophie Marceau), and another man: momentarily ignoring this, Longshanks tells Edward ""One day you will be a king: at least try to act like one.""
Wallace rebels against the English, and as his legend spreads, hundreds of Scots from the surrounding clans join him. Wallace leads his army to victory at Stirling and then sacks the city of York. All the while, Wallace seeks the assistance of Robert the Bruce (Angus Macfadyen), the son of nobleman Robert the Elder and a contender for the Scottish crown. Despite his growing admiration for Wallace and his cause, Robert is dominated by his father, who wishes to secure the throne for his son by submitting to the English.
Longshanks, worried by the threat of the rebellion, sends the wife of his son Edward, the French princess Isabella, to try to negotiate with Wallace in hopes that Wallace kills her in order to draw the French king to declare war on Wallace in revenge. Wallace refuses the bribe sent with Isabella by Longshanks, but after meeting him in person, Isabella becomes enamored with him. Meanwhile, Longshanks prepares an army to invade Scotland.
Warned of the coming invasion by Isabella, Wallace implores the Scottish nobility, who are more concerned with their own welfare, that immediate action is needed to counter the threat and to take back the country. Leading the English army himself, Longshanks confronts the Scots at the Battle of Falkirk where noblemen Lochlan and Mornay betray Wallace. The Scots lose the battle, Wallace is wounded, and Hamish's father is fatally wounded and dies after the battle. As he charges toward the departing Longshanks on horseback, Wallace is intercepted by one of the king's lancers, who turns out to be Robert the Bruce. Remorseful, Bruce gets Wallace to safety before the English can capture him. Wallace kills Mornay and Lochlan for their betrayal, avoids assassination attempts, and wages a protracted guerrilla war against the English.
Robert the Bruce, intending to join Wallace and commit troops to the war, sets up a meeting with him in Edinburgh where Robert's father has conspired with other nobles to capture and hand over Wallace to the English. Learning of his treachery, Robert the Bruce disowns his father. Following a tryst with Wallace, Isabella exacts revenge on the now terminally ill Longshanks by telling him she is pregnant with Wallace's child, intent on ending Longshank's line and ruling in his son's place.
In London, Wallace is brought before an English magistrate, tried for high treason, and condemned to public torture and beheading. Even whilst being hanged, drawn and quartered, Wallace refuses to beg for mercy and submit to the king. As cries for mercy come from the watching crowd, the magistrate offers him one final chance. Wallace instead shouts the word ""Freedom!"" Just before the axe falls, Wallace sees a vision of Murron in the crowd smiling at him.
Years after Wallace's death, Robert the Bruce, now Scotland's king, leads a Scottish army before a ceremonial line of English troops on the fields of Bannockburn where he is to formally accept English rule. As he begins to ride toward the English, he stops and turns back to his troops. Invoking Wallace's memory, he implores them to fight with him as they did with Wallace. He then leads his army into battle against the stunned English, winning the Scots their freedom.","hero,belief,freedom,sincere,trust,painful,rough,captivating,exciting,love,never take our freedom,kilt,emotional,anger,face paint,swrod,sword",1982.jpg,1995-05-18, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/braveheart/id270007336?uo=4,1cnoM8EiGGU,60000540,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Braveheart/60000540,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Drama"
7247,Breathe In,"Living in a nice house in a verdant New York community about 90 minutes from Manhattan, the Reynolds family consists of Keith (Guy Pearce), a former rock musician who teaches music locally and often subs as a cellist in a New York orchestra; his wife, Megan (Amy Ryan), who is rather pathetically preoccupied with her cookie jar collection, and their blond daughter Lauren (Mackenzie Davis), a lanky high school senior and top swimmer.
A bit disheveled and distracted most of the time, Keith misses the excitement and musical promise of his youth, so he pins what could be his last hope for professional fulfillment on an imminent audition for a chair with the symphony. Mackenzie will be off to college in a year and it's hard to tell what then lies ahead for her seemingly mismatched parents.
Arriving during a thunderstorm to stay for a term is an 18-year-old from England they've never met. Sophie (Jones) is a strikingly pretty and serious girl who's polite but discloses precious little about her personal life and can't hide her disappointment at not being closer to the city. Lauren and Sophie try to bond and have a little fun, but the former's an athlete who, she allows, recently lost her virginity to the full-of-himself Aaron (Matthew Daddario), while the latter is a guarded intellectual, suggesting limited prospects for a real friendship.
Keith expects Sophie to practice the piano for hours per day but he hears nothing until he asks her to play something for his class. In a powerful scene, Sophie begins reluctantly, then throws herself into an electrifying performance that mesmerizes Keith. A bond thus established, it then becomes a question of how these two music lovers handle the suddenly delicate domestic situation and if they allow what ought not to happen to indeed happen.
Even if there were not others to be impacted, namely Keith's wife and daughter, there would be the issue of a roughly 30-year age difference. From every angle except for mutual affinity (and whatever unknown personal and man issues Sophie may have), this is a relationship festooned with stop signs and blinking red lights. Then there's the monkey wrench supplied by Aaron, who asks Sophie to join him and a bunch of friends for a night in New York, only to trick her and turn up alone for a one-on-date and put heavy moves on, which turns Lauren irrevocably against both of them.","When a foreign exchange student arrives in a small upstate New York town, she challenges the dynamics of her host family's relationships and alters their lives forever.

Several at TF liked Drake Doremus' Like Crazy (2011) like crazy, so had high hopes for his new one, which again stars Felicity Jones getting into romantic bother abroad.
 If it's a lesser film than its predecessor, that's largely down to the narrative template it hews to, involving a young woman (Jones) entering the orbit of an older, dissatisfied family man (Guy Pearce). If the destination isn't too surprising, Doremus makes the journey worthwhile.

Taking a tack that's more between-the-lines than between-the-sheets, Breathe In yields moments of palpable erotic tension.

Jones, once again, is a class act _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü not least when playing drunk.

1687,Brick,"The lonely teenager Brendan finds his former girlfriend Emily dead in the entrance of a tunnel of sewage and recalls her phone call two days ago, when she said to him that she was in trouble. Brendan, who still loved Emily, met bad elements of his high-school trying to contact her, and when he succeeded, she told him that she was OK. He hides her body in the tunnel and decides to investigate the meaning and connection of four words, including ""brick"" and ""pin"", that Emily told him to find who killed her. Using the support of his nerd friend Brain, he successively meets the small time drug dealers Kara, Dode, Brad Bramish, Laura and Tugger, to reach the teenager powerful drug dealer The Pin. Slowly, Brendan unravels the motives why Emily was killed and plots a revenge.","High school student Brendan Frye is living a lonely existence after breaking up with his girlfriend Emily Kostich and betraying his friend Jerr to the authorities.
Brendan receives a phone call from a terrified Emily. She begs him to help her, mentioning a ""brick"", ""poor Frisco"", ""tug"", and ""the Pin"" before abruptly and fearfully hanging up. Her fear appears to have been due to a passing car, from which a distinctive-looking cigarette was thrown. Brendan searches for Emily and arranges a meeting through Dode, leader of a stoner clique that Emily belongs to. When they meet, Emily recants what she had said on the phone and tells Brendan to let her go. Brendan steals her notepad during the encounter, finding a clue that leads him to her dead body.
Brendan takes it upon himself to solve her murder, enlisting the aid of an acquaintance named Brain. Brendan hides the body to avoid police intrusion. Brendan discovers that ""The Pin"" mentioned by Emily is a local drug baron. Brendan sets about getting The Pin's attention by beating up Brad Bramish, an arrogant jock and The Pin's regular customer. Afterwards, Brendan is beaten up by an unknown man.
Brendan meets The Pin and persuades him to consider Brendan for a spot in his operation. Laura, Brad's squeeze, tells Brendan that The Pin had rejected Emily's attempt to join, so she stole the title's brick. Laura offers to help Brendan, but he does not trust her. The Pin accepts Brendan. Brendan gets a call from Dode, who says he saw Brendan hide Emily's body and, believing Brendan to be the murderer, vows to ruin him. Brendan meets with The Pin, who suspects an uprising from Tug, the gang member who had earlier beat up Brendan.
Brain learns that ""poor Frisco"" is Frisco Farr, a student who fell into a coma after injecting poorly-cut heroin. Brendan learns from Tug that The Pin initially received a shipment of ten bricks. He has sold eight. The ninth was stolen and replaced with one that had been doctored with detergent, causing Frisco's coma. The Pin interrupts to tell Tug about meeting someone who knows what happened to Emily. Brendan, weakened from several recent fistfights, intercepts Dode before the meeting and discovers Emily was pregnant when she died. Dode tries to tell Tug and The Pin that Brendan killed Emily, but Tug goes berserk and shoots Dode in the head. Tug then threatens The Pin, who walks away as Brendan faints due to internal bleeding.
Brendan awakens in Tug's bedroom, then Tug says he's at war with The Pin. Brendan arranges a meeting between Tug and The Pin. Brendan sleeps with Laura, noticing that she smokes the distinctive cigarettes he had seen after Emily's first phone call. At the meeting, chaos erupts when it is discovered that the tenth brick is missing. Tug beats The Pin to death while Brendan flees, escaping just as police arrive. As he goes he passes the trunk of Tug's car, where Emily's body is visible because he had hidden her there before the meeting to ensure that police pin her murder on Tug.
The next day, Brendan reveals to Laura that he knows she set Emily up to take the fall for Laura's theft of the ninth brick. She further manipulated Emily into meeting Tug, letting him believe he was responsible for Emily's pregnancy. It is revealed that Laura later stole the tenth brick. Brendan tells Laura he has put the truth in a note to Vice Principal Trueman, who finds the brick in Laura's locker. Laura vindictively tells Brendan that Emily expressed regret that she couldn't keep her pregnancy because she didn't love the prospective father, and that Emily was three months pregnant when she died, implying that the baby was his. The film ends with Brendan watching Laura as she walks away.",,1687.jpg,2006-04-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/brick/id360543376?uo=4,,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
2657,Brideshead Revisited,"Inspired by the bestselling novel, Brideshead Revisited is a riveting drama of forbidden love, power and betrayal, featuring stunning performances by Academy Award winner Emma Thompson (Best Actress, Howard s End, 1992) and Matthew Goode (The Lookout). When the charming aristocrat Sebastian invites Charles Ryder to his family's estate, Charles becomes seduced by the opulent lifestyle of the Marchmain family, and by Julia, Sebastian's sister. As their romance deepens, repercussions follow, and Charles discovers that at Brideshead, love, money and power come at a price. It's a spellbinding story you'll want to revisit again and again.","Although he aspires to become an artist, middle-class Charles Ryder reads history at the University of Oxford, where he befriends wealthy Lord Sebastian Flyte, a flamboyant homosexual and alcoholic. Sebastian's family, the noble Marchmains, strongly disapprove of both proclivities. When Sebastian takes him home to visit his nanny, Charles is enthralled by the grandeur of the Marchmain family estate, known as Brideshead, and he is entranced by its residents, including the devout Catholic Lady Marchmain and her other children, Sebastian's elder brother Bridey and his sisters Julia and Cordelia.
When Lord Marchmain invites Sebastian and Julia to visit him and his mistress Cara in Venice, Lady Marchmain encourages Charles to accompany them in the hope he can act as a positive influence on her son. Increasingly interested in Julia, Charles surreptitiously kisses her in a dark alley, unaware Sebastian can see them from the opposite side of the canal. Jealous of his attention to his sibling, Sebastian ends their friendship. On their return to England, Lady Marchmain makes it clear Charles cannot marry her daughter since he professes to be an atheist.
Sebastian's mother, concerned about his increasing alcoholism, rescinds his allowance. During a visit to Brideshead, Ryder gives Sebastian money, which he uses to purchase alcohol. When he arrives drunk and improperly dressed at a ball celebrating Julia's engagement to Canadian Rex Mottram, Lady Marchmain blames Charles and tells him he no longer is welcome at Brideshead.
Sebastian flees to Morocco where, at the request of the now terminally-ill Lady Marchmain, Charles finds him hospitalised. His plan to bring him home is disrupted when the doctor warns him Sebastian is too ill to travel.
Years later, Charles - now married and a successful painter - reunites with Julia on an ocean liner en-route to England from New York. They realize they are still in love and decide to leave their respective spouses and live together.
Charles returns to Brideshead and persuades Rex to step aside so he and Julia can be together. Rex agrees to the proposal in exchange for two of Charles' paintings, an arrangement that shocks and angers Julia, who feels like bartered goods. Without warning, a dying Lord Marchmain and Cara arrive at Brideshead so he can spend his final days in his former home. On his deathbed Lord Marchmain, hitherto an atheist, regains his faith and dies a reconciled Catholic. Deeply affected by her father's transformation, Julia decides she cannot relinquish her faith to marry Charles, and the two part.
Several years later, during World War II, Charles - now a disillusioned army captain - finds himself once again at Brideshead, which the army has requisitioned as a military base. A corporal tells him Julia is serving in the reserves and that her elder brother died during the Blitz. In the movie's final scene, Charles visits the family chapel, where he finds a single lit candle. He dips his hand in holy water and moves to snuff out the candle between his fingers, but leaves the flame still burning.","sentimental,clever,sincere,touching,contemplative",2657.jpg, ,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/brideshead-revisited/id432470136?uo=4 ,cwUA82BGUdk,70098894,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Brideshead_Revisited/70098894,Drama
7319,Bridesmaids,"Annie (Kristen Wiig), is a maid of honor whose life unravels as she leads her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), and a group of colorful bridesmaids (Rose Byrne, Melissa McCarthy, Wendi McLendon-Covey and Ellie Kemper) on a wild ride down the road to matrimony. Annie's life is a mess. But when she finds out her lifetime best friend is engaged, she simply must serve as Lillian's maid of honor. Though lovelorn and broke, Annie bluffs her way through the expensive and bizarre rituals. With one chance to get it perfect, she'll show Lillian and her bridesmaids just how far you'll go for someone you love.","Annie Walker (Kristen Wiig) is a single woman in her mid-30s. Following the failure of her bakery, she lost her boyfriend and her savings, reducing her career to a sales clerk and forcing her to share an apartment with an obnoxious roommate and his sister. Her business's failure was so painful that she has given up baking entirely. She has a no-strings-attached sexual relationship with the self-absorbed Ted (Jon Hamm) but hopes for something more. Her best friend Lillian Donovan (Maya Rudolph) is virtually her only source of happiness.
Lillian becomes engaged and asks Annie to be her maid of honor. At the engagement party, Annie meets her fellow bridesmaids: Lillian's cynical cousin Rita (Wendi McLendon-Covey); idealistic friend Becca (Ellie Kemper); raunchy future sister-in-law Megan (Melissa McCarthy); and Helen Harris III (Rose Byrne), the beautiful but over-the-top wife of Lillian's fianc‚àö¬©'s boss. Helen and Annie, each jealous of the other's friendship with Lillian, take an instant dislike to each other, but Lillian persuades them to spend time together.
Annie takes Lillian and the bridesmaids to a Brazilian steak restaurant for lunch before going to a chic bridal shop. However, Helen must use her influence to gain access to the shop when Annie neglects to make a reservation. While trying on gowns, the entire party‚Äö√Ñ√Æwith the exception of Helen, who did not eat food at the restaurant‚Äö√Ñ√Æbecomes sick from food poisoning, ruining their afternoon. Later, Annie's suggestion of a bachelorette party at Lillian's parents' lake house is overruled in favor of a trip to Las Vegas planned by Helen. Worried about her finances and too proud to accept a ticket paid for by Helen, Annie books a ticket in coach while the rest of the party flies first class. However, the trip is cut short due to an outburst from Annie, who due to her fear of flying had accepted a sedative from Helen. The scene on-board the plane forces an emergency landing in Casper, Wyoming, following which the party takes a bus back home. Annie tries to apologize but Lillian tells Annie she wants Helen to take over planning the shower and wedding.
Annie continues to hope for a relationship with Ted, but begins flirting with Officer Nathan Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), a friendly traffic cop who earlier had let her off without a ticket for broken taillights. Nathan encourages her to open a new bakery, but Annie refuses. Following a night together, the next morning Nathan buys baking supplies with which he suggests Annie make them breakfast. Offended, Annie leaves. Annie is later fired from her job and‚Äö√Ñ√Æunable to pay rent‚Äö√Ñ√Æmoves in with her mother.
Annie travels to Chicago for the bridal shower at Helen's home, which has been transformed into an Paris-themed event. Helen then upstages Annie's heartfelt, handmade shower gift by giving Lillian a trip to Paris, an idea Annie expressed earlier, which Helen stole. Enraged that Helen has taken credit for the Parisian theme, Annie throws a temper tantrum, is kicked out of the shower and the wedding. On her way home, Annie is involved in a car accident, but the other driver flees the scene. Still hurt from Annie's dismissal, Nathan refuses to help and she must instead call Ted to pick her up. When he asks her to perform oral sex on him on the way home, she breaks off the relationship and walks home.
Throughout the next several days Annie becomes reclusive, refusing to leave her mother's house and watching television obsessively. After a pep talk from Megan, Annie realizes her errors and tries to make amends with Nathan, but he ignores her. On the day of the wedding, Helen appears at Annie's doorstep distraught; Lillian has disappeared, and Helen begs for Annie's help in finding her. Helen and Annie have a reconciliation of sorts, and Helen apologizes to Annie. The two enlist Nathan to help, and he grudgingly agrees. The group find Lillian at her own apartment, discovering that she ran from her wedding due to Helen's micromanagement and her fear that Annie will end up alone. After reconciling, Annie helps Lillian prepare for her wedding.
Annie resumes her place as maid of honor at the wedding. After the wedding, which included over-the-top arrangements by Helen, she again apologizes to Annie and states her hope that they can be friends in the future. Realizing that Annie and Nathan were falling in love, Helen had also arranged for him to pick Annie up after the wedding, and the pair leave together.",,7319.jpg,2011-06-22,,nsUEd2cUIqo,70184047,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Bridesmaids/70184047,Comedy
1162,Bridge to Terabithia,"A rousing fantasy adventure about family, friendship, and the wondrous power of imagination. A perpetual outsider both at home and at school, Jess Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) just never seems to fit in no matter how hard he tries. When his goal to become the fastest runner in middle school is unexpectedly thwarted by newly arrived classmate Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb), who enters in an ""all boys"" race and leaves her competitors in the dust, Jess soon strikes up a friendship with the imaginative outsider. Their bond is soon cemented thanks to Leslie's love for storytelling and Jess' skill as an artist, and the two lonely kids create a secret kingdom called Terabithia that is only accessible by swinging over a stream on a nearby rope. Though Jess and Leslie may be considered outcasts by their classmates, their adventures in Terabithia find the pair doing battle against the dreaded Dark Master and his malevolent creatures while plotting revenge against the schoolyard bullies. Now, thanks to his adventures in Terabithia and his friendship with Leslie, Jess finally finds the confidence needed to stand tall and be himself.","Jesse Aarons (Josh Hutcherson) is a fifth-grade aspiring artist living with his financially struggling family in Lark Creek, Virginia. He rides the bus to his elementary school with his little sister May Belle (Bailee Madison), where he avoids the school bully, Janice Avery (Lauren Clinton). In class, Jesse is teased by classmates Scott Hoager (Cameron Wakefield) and Gary Fulcher (Elliot Lawless), and meets a new student his age by the name Leslie Burke (AnnaSophia Robb). At recess, Jesse enters a running event, for which he had been training at home. Leslie also enters and manages to beat all the boys, much to Jesse's irritation. On the way home, Jesse and Leslie learn that they are next-door neighbors.
Later in the evening, Jesse becomes frustrated when he finds that May Belle drew in his notebook, but his mom (Kate Butler) who favors her daughters and his strict father (Robert Patrick) sides with her. He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his father never spends time with him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jesse's drawing ability after seeing his notebook, and they soon become best friends. Every day after school they venture into the woods and swing across a creek on a rope. Jesse and Leslie find an abandoned tree house and a broken down truck on the other side, and invent a new world, which Leslie names ""Terabithia"". The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings and spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other, ruling Terabithia as King and Queen.
Leslie gives Jesse an art kit for his birthday, much to his delight. Later, he gives her a puppy, whom she decides to name Prince Terrien (P.T. for short). Once in Terabithia, they fight with various creatures, including a troll resembling Janice. In one particular scene, Leslie walks onto a log and shouts ""We rule Terabithia and nothing crushes us!"" At school, Janice puts a fee on entering the girls' bathroom. Leslie becomes frustrated by her fee and she and Jesse play a prank on Janice. Once Leslie's parents finish writing their book, she and Jesse help paint a room in their house. Jesse is impressed by her parents' happiness, and smiles as he watches their family. At school on Friday, Leslie hears Janice Avery crying in the bathroom. After Leslie talks with her, she discovers that the reason why Janice is a bully is that she is abused by her father, and they become friends. Jesse and Leslie then take P.T. to Terabithia, where they fight off several creatures resembling students at their school. They decide to go home when it starts raining and the creek gets higher than ever, and Jesse realizes that he has started having feelings for Leslie as she runs back to her house, for the last time.
The next morning, Ms. Edmunds (Zooey Deschanel), Jesse's music teacher, calls to invite him on a one-on-one field trip to an art museum. Jesse tries to ask his mother's permission; however, she is half-asleep and he takes her mumbling as approval. Jesse does not ask Leslie to accompany him, and merely looks at her house as they drive by. When he returns home, Jesse finds that his father and mother are worried sick because they did not know where he was. His father tells him that Leslie drowned in the creek after falling in (possibly due to head injury) because the rope broke in the same morning when Jesse went to the museum. The family therefore thought that Jesse had drowned too. Jesse is heartbroken, and says he doesn't believe that Leslie drowned.
The following day, Jesse and his parents visit the Burke family home to pay their respects. Leslie's father, Bill Burke (Latham Gaines), tells Jesse that she loved him, and thanks him for being a very good friend to her, since she had trouble making friends at her old school. Jesse feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie's death because he didn't invite her to the museum trip and for not being there for her. He runs back into the forest, and breaks down in tears. His father tells him that it's not his fault and says, ""She brought you something special when she came here, didn't she? That's what you hold on to. That's how you keep her alive"".
Jesse decides to re-imagine Terabithia and builds a bridge with a sign saying ""Nothing Crushes Us"" across the creek to welcome a new ruler. He invites his sister May Belle to enter Terabithia; she is delighted because she was previously denied every opportunity to enter. She and Jesse bring back Terabithia in even greater splendor, with Jesse as king and his sister as princess.","sentimental,belief,emotional,trust,feel good,bittersweet,surprise,anticipation,captivating",1162.jpg,2007-02-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/bridge-to-terabithia/id254088647?uo=4,T2TDSEG57hI,70053832,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Bridge_to_Terabithia/70053832,"Action & Adventure,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
3094,Brokeback Mountain,"Winner of three Academy Awards, including Best Director, Brokeback Mountain is a sweeping epic that explores the lives of two young men, a ranch hand and a rodeo cowboy, who meet in the summer of 1963 and unexpectedly forge a lifelong connection. The complications, joys and heartbreak they experience provide a testament to the endurance and power of love. Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal deliver emotionally charged, remarkably moving performances in ""a movie that is destined to become one of the great classics of our time"" (Clay Smith, The Insider).","In 1963, Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) and Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) are hired by Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) to herd his sheep through the summer in Wyoming. After a night of heavy drinking, Jack makes a sexual pass at Ennis, who is initially apprehensive but eventually falls to Jack's advances. Though he informs Jack that it was a one-time incident, they develop a sexual and emotional relationship. Shortly after learning their summer together is being cut short, they briefly fight, and each is bloodied.
After Jack and Ennis part ways, Ennis marries his longtime fianc‚àö¬©e Alma Beers (Michelle Williams) and fathers two children. Jack returns the next summer, but Aguirre, who witnessed Jack and Ennis on the mountain, does not re-hire him. Jack meets, marries, and starts a family with rodeo rider Lureen Newsome (Anne Hathaway). After four years, Jack visits Ennis. Upon meeting the two kiss passionately, which Alma accidentally witnesses. Jack broaches the subject of creating a life together on a small ranch, but Ennis, haunted by a childhood memory of the torture and murder of a man suspected of homosexual behavior, refuses. He is also unwilling to abandon his family. Ennis and Jack continue to meet for infrequent fishing trips.
The marriages of both men deteriorate. Alma and Ennis eventually divorce. Ennis sees his family regularly until Alma finally confronts him about her knowledge of the true nature of his relationship with Jack which incites a violent argument and causes Ennis to abandon his connections with Alma. Lureen abandons her rodeo days and becomes a businesswoman with her father and expects Jack to work in sales. Hearing about Ennis's divorce, Jack drives to Wyoming hoping they can live together, but Ennis refuses to move away from his children. Jack finds solace with male prostitutes in Mexico. Ennis meets and has a brief romantic relationship with a waitress, Cassie Cartwright (Linda Cardellini). Jack and Lureen meet and befriend another couple, Randall and Lashawn Malone, and it is implied that Jack and Randall begin an affair behind their wives' backs.
At the end of a fishing trip, Ennis attempts to push back their next meeting. An argument erupts over Jack's frustration at him and Ennis meeting infrequently and Ennis blames Jack for being the cause of his own conflicted actions. Jack attempts to hold him and there is a brief struggle, but they end up locked in an embrace. A flashback of Ennis saying goodbye to Jack during their summer on Brokeback Mountain fades back to Jack watching Ennis drive away.
Some time later, a postcard Ennis sends to Jack is returned stamped ""Deceased"". In a telephone conversation, Lureen tells Ennis that Jack died when a tire he was changing exploded; while listening, Ennis imagines Jack being bludgeoned to death by a gang. Jack's actual fate is left ""deliberately ambiguous"".[7] Lureen tells Ennis that Jack wanted to have his ashes scattered on Brokeback Mountain, but she does not know where it is. Ennis travels to meet with Jack's mother and father (Roberta Maxwell and Peter McRobbie), where he offers to take Jack's ashes ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ but the father refuses, preferring to have them interred in a family plot. In Jack's childhood bedroom, Ennis finds the bloodstained shirt he thought he lost on Brokeback Mountain, realizing that Jack kept it hanging with the bloodstained shirt Jack himself wore during that fight. Ennis holds them up to his face, breathing in their scent and silently weeping. Jack's mother allows him to keep the shirts.
Later, 19-year-old Alma Jr. (Kate Mara) arrives at her father's trailer with the news that she is engaged. She asks Ennis for his blessing and invites him to the wedding. Ennis asks her if her fianc‚àö¬© really loves her, and she answers ""yes"". After Alma's departure, Ennis goes to his closet. Hanging on a nail pounded into the door are the shirts, with a postcard of Brokeback Mountain tacked above. Now Jack's shirt is tucked inside of Ennis's. Ennis fastens the top button of Jack's shirt, and with tears in his eyes mutters, ""Jack, I swear..."" while straightening the postcard, before closing the door and walking away.","sadness,sincere,emotional,touching,anger,gay,trust,sexual,atmospheric,bittersweet,captivating,gloomy",3094.jpg,2005-12-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/brokeback-mountain/id293294355?uo=4,yPjMWNfxA0Y,70023965,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Brokeback_Mountain/70023965,"Drama,Romance"

So says Buck Brannaman, a true American cowboy and sage on horseback who travels the country for nine grueling months a year helping horses with people problems. BUCK, a richly textured and visually stunning film, follows Brannaman from his abusive childhood to his phenomenally successful approach to horses.

2045,Bugsy,"Warren Beatty and Annette Bening star in the incredible true story of Benjamin Bugsy Siegel, the playboy gangster who betrayed the Mob for love. A cold-blooded killer who dreamed of Hollywood stardom, a crazed patriot who plotted against Mussolini, and the brilliant visionary who carved Las Vegas out of the dry Nevada desert, Bugsy had it all. Until he fell for the one woman who wanted more. A critical masterpiece, BUGSY is a remarkable collaboration of Hollywood's best: director Barry Levinson, screenwriter James Toback, and an all-star supporting cast that includes Harvey Keitel, Oscar(r)-winner Ben Kingsley (Best Actor, Gandhi,1982), Joe Mantegna, and Elliott Gould. But at the center of itall is the white-hot romance between Bugsy and the insatiable starlet, Virginia Hill.","Gangster Benjamin ""Bugsy"" Siegel (Warren Beatty), who works for the New York mob, goes to California and instantly falls in love with Virginia Hill (Annette Bening), a Hollywood starlet. The two meet for the first time when Bugsy visits his friend, actor George Raft, on a movie set. He buys a house in Beverly Hills from opera singer Lawrence Tibbett, planning to stay while his wife and two daughters remain in Scarsdale.
As a representative for his associates Meyer Lansky and Charlie Luciano, Bugsy is in California to wrestle control of betting parlors away from Los Angeles gangster Jack Dragna. Mickey Cohen robs Dragna's office one day, and is confronted by Bugsy, who decides he should be in business with the guy who committed the robbery, not the guy who got robbed. Cohen is put in charge of the betting casinos; Dragna is forced to admit to a raging Bugsy that he stole $14,000, and is told he now answers to Cohen.
After an earlier argument about Virginia's sexual trysts with drummer Gene Krupa and a variety of bull fighters, Virginia makes a romantic move on Siegel.
On a trip to Nevada to visit a gambling joint, Bugsy comes up with the idea for a casino in the desert. He obtains $1 million in funding from his longtime friend Meyer Lansky (Ben Kingsley) and other New York mobsters.
Bugsy puts Virginia in charge of accounting and begins construction of the Flamingo Las Vegas Hotel Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, but the budget soon soars to $6 million due to his extravagance. Bugsy tries everything to ensure it gets completed, even selling his share of the casino and most of his belongings.
Bugsy is visited in Los Angeles by former associate Harry Greenberg. Harry has betrayed his old associates to save himself. Harry has also run out of money, from a combination of his gambling habits, and being extorted by the prosecutors who want his testimony. Though he is Harry's last and only friend, Bugsy has no choice but to kill Harry.
Bugsy is arrested for Harry's murder. The only witness is a cab driver who dropped off Harry in front of Bugsy's Beverly Hills house. The driver is escorted to the train station by Mickey Cohen. Meyer is waiting for Bugsy outside the jail. Meyer has a satchel of money that he gives to his friend. ""Charlie doesn't have to know about it,"" he tells Bugsy, but warns ""I can't protect you anymore.""
Upset about the costs, the fact that the casino is a failure, and that $2 million of the budget is unaccounted for, Meyer Lansky asks Bugsy to meet him in Los Angeles. Bugsy discovers that Virginia stole the money, but tells her to ""keep it and save it for a rainy day"". He then calls Lansky and tells him never to sell his share of the casino and that he will live to thank him someday.
Later that night, Bugsy is killed by several gunshots. Virginia is told the news back in Las Vegas and becomes upset, rushing out of the casino. The ending text before the credits states that she returned the missing money a week later and committed suicide at some point after that. It also states that by 1991 the $6 million invested in Bugsy's dream of Las Vegas had generated revenues of over $100 billion.","sentimental,rough,suspenseful,captivating,tense",2045.jpg,1991-12-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/bugsy/id276898636?uo=4,Bs296PVx01E,70058803,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Bugsy/70058803,Drama

962,Burlesque,"Ali (Christina Aguilera) is a small-town girl with a big voice who escapes hardship and an uncertain future to follow her dreams to LA. After stumbling upon The Burlesque Lounge, a majestic but ailing theater that is home to an inspired musical revue, Ali lands a job as a cocktail waitress from Tess (Cher), the club's proprietor and headliner. Burlesque's outrageous costumes and bold choreography enrapture the young ingenue, who vows to perform there one day. Soon enough, Ali builds a friendship with a featured dancer (Julianne Hough), finds an enemy in a troubled, jealous performer (Kristen Bell), and garners the affection of Jack (Cam Gigandet), a bartender and fellow musician. With the help of a sharp-witted stage manager (Stanley Tucci) and gender-bending host (Alan Cumming), Ali makes her way from the bar to the stage. Her spectacular voice restores The Burlesque Lounge to its former glory, though not before a charismatic entrepreneur (Eric Dane) arrives with an enticing proposal...","Ali Rose (Aguilera) moves to Los Angeles after she quits her bar job when her boss refuses to pay her. Once in L.A., she tries and fails at every audition she does until one night, she finds herself unknowingly in a burlesque club when she hears the music on the street. She finds Tess (Cher) and the dancers performing ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Welcome to Burlesque‚Äö√Ñ√π and decides to pursue a career on stage once she meets Jack (Gigandet). Jack refers her to Tess for an audition, but is rejected instantly and ushered out by Sean (Tucci). Instead of leaving, Ali begins serving customers at the club as a waitress, while Tess and Sean observe with Jack asking Tess to give Ali a chance.
When Georgia (Hough) becomes pregnant, auditions are held to replace her. Ali begins her audition when everyone leaves, and after performing ""Wagon Wheel Watusi"", persuades Tess to allow her to become one of the club's dancers, much to the annoyance of Nikki (Bell), a performer who is always late and caught drinking before numbers. When Nikki appears drunk, Tess orders Ali to take her place. Behind the stage, Tess and her ex-husband/co-owner Vince (Gallagher) argue with Marcus (Dane), who wants to buy the club to save it from foreclosure.
Nikki is mad that Ali took her place, so in the middle of her performance, she cuts off the sound. Sean immediately tries to lower the curtain but Ali begins to sing the song without the music, a cappella, and the curtain is again raised. Everyone is impressed by her beautiful, strong voice and Tess excitedly announces that she will create a new show around the new lead singer and dancer, Ali. Sean, impressed by Ali, tells Jack that he should make a move on Ali before it's too late, even though Jack is already engaged. Kind of showing Jack's relationship is rocky. Despite the club's growing success, Tess is still unable to pay the bank.
One night after the club closes, Tess, worried with the club's economic prospects, sings ""You Haven't Seen the Last of Me"". A very jealous Nikki shows up drunk and picks a fight with Tess, calling Ali a ""slut with mutant lungs"". Tess, who has grown frustrated with Nikki, questions her gratitude for the help she has received. Angered, Nikki quits on the spot (before falsely confessing that she slept with Vince after his and Tess' honeymoon), and the altercation ends when Tess angrily retaliates by smashing the passenger side window on Nikki's convertible with a crowbar.
Tensions arise between Ali and Jack as Marcus grows increasingly infatuated with Ali, making Jack jealous. At Georgia's wedding, Jack appears to call off his engagement, getting drunk. That night, Ali and Jack sleep together, but the following morning Jack's fianc‚àö¬©, Natalie (Agron), returns unexpectedly from her play in New York and tells Ali that the engagement is still on. Jack denies this, and while trying to fix things, he asks Ali to leave. Feeling heartbroken and betrayed, Ali runs to Sean for support, who prompts her to go with Marcus after his phone call.
While spending time with Marcus, Ali finds out about ""air rights"", which refers to the empty space above a building and what can be done with it. Ali breaks things off with Marcus after she sees his plans to build a skyscraper on the property the club is on. Ali tells Tess, and together they inform the owner of the new million-dollar condos across the street; fearing the loss of business that would result from the obstruction of his prospective tenants' view, he purchases the air rights to the club's property. The resulting money is enough for Tess to buy out Vince's share, pay off the bank, and re-fashion the club to her own vision. She also makes up with Nikki and rehires her at the club. In the end Ali, having reunited with Jack and earned Nikki's respect, performs ""Show Me How You Burlesque"" with all of the dancers, a song which Jack wrote and finally finished.","sexy,stylized",962.jpg,2010-11-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/burlesque/id415822621?uo=4,1PiPYAz7f0Q,70137790,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Burlesque/70137790,"Drama,Musical & Performing Arts,Romance"

When a disc filled with some of the CIA's most irrelevant secrets gets in the hands of two determined, but dim-witted, gym employees, the duo are intent on exploiting their find. But since blackmail is a trade better left for the experts, events soon spiral out of everyone's and anyone's control, resulting in a non-stop series of hilarious encounters! From Joel and Ethan Coen, the Academy Award¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫-winning directors of No Country For Old Men and The Big Lebowski, comes this brilliantly clever and endlessly entertaining movie that critics are calling, ""smart, funny, and original"" (Ben Lyons, E!).","Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her extramarital affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD.
When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistake the numerical data in the Cox's bank records and the cryptic first draft of Osbourne's memoir to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for cosmetic surgery. But when a phone call and subsequent in-person meeting with Osbourne goes horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Cox home to get more files from their computer.
Meanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior - aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda - prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer to move in. A womanizing Treasury Department employee and U.S. Marshal, Pfarrer is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda. Chad, who was sent by Linda to find more files on Cox, is discovered hiding in a wardrobe in the Cox home by Pfarrer and shot dead.
Two days later at the CIA headquarters, an official named Palmer and his director learn that information from Osbourne has been given to the Russian Embassy. They are perplexed and decide to maintain observation until the situation ""makes sense"" They also get a hold of Chad and put him into the witness protection program. Harry, gets into an argument with Katie and decides to leave the house. On his way out, he spots a man who has been trailing him for the past several days. After tackling him to the ground, Harry finds out that the man is a process server tasked with giving him divorce papers from his wife Sandy, who is having an extramarital liaison of her own. Harry is devastated and goes to see an agitated Linda, who confides in Harry that her friend Chad is missing; he agrees to try to help find him.
The next morning, Harry and Linda meet in a park, and she provides him with more information about Chad's disappearance. When Harry realizes that there are strange men in the park, he flees in terror, assuming Linda is a spy. Linda then turns to Ted Treffon, the kindhearted manager of Hardbodies, who has unrequited feelings for her. Believing the Russians have kidnapped Chad, he agrees to go to the Cox home to search Osbourne's computer. Unemployed and having spent the past several days living on a small boat, Osbourne becomes unhinged when he finds out that his wife has emptied his bank accounts, and, no longer having keys, decides to break into the house to get some of his personal belongings. Finding Ted in the basement, Osbourne initially takes him to be Katie's lover. He soon realizes Ted's affiliation with Linda and the rest of the ""league of morons"" he feels he has been struggling against his whole life, and fires a gunshot at him. Ted manages to get out of the house, only to be fatally attacked by a hatchet-wielding Osbourne.
At CIA headquarters a few days later, Palmer and his director try to understand what exactly happened. It is revealed that while trying to board a flight to Venezuela, Harry was detained because his name was on a hot list, Ted's body has been disposed of and the CIA are holding Linda who is promising to keep quiet about everything if they will pay for her cosmetic surgery. A CIA agent shot Osbourne during his hatchet assault on Ted and the bullet has put Osbourne in a coma. The director instructs Palmer to let Harry fly to Venezuela, saying that the U.S. has no extradition treaty with Venezuela, decides the CIA will pay for Linda's surgery and postpones considering Osbourne's situation until he regains consciousness, which is not likely. The director tells Palmer that they did not really learn anything.","exciting,humorous,biting,clever,cynical",1589.jpg,2008-08-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/burn-after-reading/id296763805?uo=4,ossq0Cay7mk,70098606,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Burn_After_Reading/70098606,"Comedy,Drama"
3171,Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,,"In late 1890s Wyoming, Butch Cassidy (Paul Newman) is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw Hole in the Wall Gang. His closest companion is the laconic dead-shot ""Sundance Kid"" (Robert Redford). The two return to their hideout at Hole-in-the-Wall to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Butch's long absences, have selected Harvey Logan (Ted Cassidy) as their new leader. Harvey challenges Butch to a knife fight over the gang's leadership. Butch defeats him using trickery, but embraces his idea to rob the Union Pacific Overland Flyer train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap even more money than the first.
The first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Butch and Sundance visit a favorite brothel in a nearby town and watch, amused, as the town sheriff (Kenneth Mars) unsuccessfully attempts to organize a posse to track down the gang. They then visit Sundance's lover, schoolteacher Etta Place (Katharine Ross). On the second train robbery, Butch uses too much dynamite to blow open the safe, blowing up the baggage car. As the gang scrambles to gather up the money, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen.
The robbers scatter but the posse heads after Butch and Sundance, who unsuccessfully try to hide out in the brothel and to seek amnesty from the friendly Sheriff Bledsoe (Jeff Corey). As the posse remains in pursuit despite all attempts to elude them, Butch and Sundance determine that the group includes renowned Indian tracker ""Lord Baltimore"" and relentless lawman Joe LeFors, recognizable by his white skimmer. Butch and Sundance finally elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Etta that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head E. H. Harriman to remain on their trail until Butch and Sundance are both killed.
Butch persuades Sundance and Etta that the three should escape to Bolivia, which Butch envisions as a robber's paradise. On their arrival there, a dismayed Sundance regards the country with contempt while Butch remains optimistic. They soon discover that they know too little Spanish to pull off a bank robbery, so Etta attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as Los Bandidos Yanquis. However, their confidence drops when they see a man wearing a white skimmer and fear that Harriman's posse is still after them.
Butch suggests ""going straight"", and he and Sundance land their first honest job as payroll guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local bandits on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris (Strother Martin), is killed. Butch and Sundance ambush and kill the bandits, the first time Butch has ever shot someone. Concluding that the straight life isn't for them, they return to robbery, but Etta decides to return to the United States.
Butch and Sundance steal a payroll and the mules carrying it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the mules' brand and alerts the local police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. They take cover in a building, but are both seriously wounded when Butch has to make a run to the mules for more ammunition. As dozens of Bolivian soldiers surround the area, Butch suggests the duo's next destination should be Australia. The film ends with a freeze frame shot on the pair charging out of the building, guns blazing, as the Bolivian forces fire repeatedly on them.","friendship,western,gun slinger,trust,joy",3171.jpg,1969-09-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/butch-cassidy-sundance-kid/id401101707?uo=4,,26308213,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Butch_Cassidy_and_the_Sundance_Kid/26308213,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Western"
636,Cabaret,"Willkommen, bienvenue, welcome to Cabaret. The winner of eight Academy Awards, it boasts a score by the legendary songwriting partnership behind another film that would energize the movie musical genre with equal razzle-dazzle 30 years later: Chicago's John Kander and Fred Ebb. Inside the Kit Kat Club of 1931 Berlin, starry-eyed singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) and an impish emcee (Joel Grey) sound the clarion call to decadent fun, while outside a certain political party grows into a brutal force. Cabaret caught lightning (and won Oscars) for Minnelli, Grey and director Bob Fosse, who shaped a triumph of style and substance. Come to this Cabaret, old chum. You'll never want to leave.","In 1931 Berlin, American artist Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) performs at the Kit Kat Klub. A new arrival in the city, Brian Roberts (Michael York), moves into Sally's boarding house. A reserved English academic and writer, Brian gives English lessons to earn a living while completing his doctorate in Philosophy. Sally unsuccessfully tries to seduce Brian and suspects he may be gay. Brian tells Sally that on three previous occasions he has tried to have physical relationships with women, all of which have failed. The unlikely pair become friends, and Brian is witness to Sally's anarchic, bohemian life in the last days of the German Weimar Republic. Later in the film, Sally and Brian become lovers despite their earlier reservations, and Brian and Sally conclude with irony that his previous failures with women were because they were ""the wrong three girls.""
Sally befriends Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem), a rich playboy baron who takes her and Brian to his country estate. It becomes ambiguous which of the duo Max is seducing, epitomized by a scene in which the three dance intimately together in a wine-induced reverie. After a sexual experience with Brian, Max loses interest in the two, and departs for Argentina. During an argument, when Sally triumphantly tells Brian that she has been having sex with Max, Brian begins to laugh and reveals that has been having sex with Max as well. Brian storms off and picks a fight with a group of Nazis, who beat him senseless. Brian and Sally make up in their rooming house, where Sally reveals that Max left them an envelope of money.
Later on, Sally finds out that she's pregnant and is unsure whether Brian or Max is the father. Brian offers to marry her and take her back to his university life in Cambridge. After a scene that shows Sally's ambivalence about going to Cambridge to be a housewife and mother, she proceeds with an abortion. When Brian confronts her, she shares her fears and the two reach an understanding. The film ends with Brian departing for England by train, and Sally continuing her life in Berlin, singing ""Cabaret"" to a highly appreciative audience.","stylized,biting,sentimental,captivating",636.jpg,1972-02-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cabaret/id278873289?uo=4,YE3xrfjAJfs,342645,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cabaret/342645,"Classics,Drama,Musical & Performing Arts"

3213,Captain America: The First Avenger,"After being deemed unfit for military service, Steve Rogers volunteers for a top secret research project that turns him into Captain America, a superhero dedicated to defending America's ideals.","In March 1942, Nazi officer Johann Schmidt and his men invade T‚àö‚àènsberg, Norway, to steal a mysterious Tesseract[a] possessing untold powers. Meanwhile, in New York City, Steve Rogers is rejected for World War II military duty because of various health and physical problems. While attending an exhibition of future technologies with his friend Sgt. James ""Bucky"" Barnes, Rogers again attempts to enlist. Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, Dr. Abraham Erskine allows Rogers to enlist. He is recruited in the Scientific Strategic Reserve as part of a ""super-soldier"" experiment under Erskine, Col. Chester Phillips, and British agent Peggy Carter. Phillips is unconvinced by Erskine's claims that Rogers is the right person for the procedure, but relents after seeing Rogers commit an act of self-sacrificing bravery. The night before the treatment, Erskine reveals to Rogers that Schmidt underwent an imperfect version of the procedure and suffered side-effects.
Back in Europe, Schmidt and Dr. Arnim Zola successfully harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions. Schmidt, having discovered Erskine's location, dispatches an assassin to kill him. In America, Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with ""vita-rays"". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, one of the attendees kills Erskine, revealing himself to be Schmidt's assassin, Heinz Kruger. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin commits suicide by cyanide capsule before he can be interrogated.
With Erskine dead and his super-soldier formula lost, U.S. Senator Brandt has Rogers tour the nation in a colorful costume as ""Captain America"" to promote war bonds, rather than allow scientists to study him and attempt to rediscover the formula. In 1943, while on tour in Italy performing for active servicemen, Rogers learns that Barnes' unit was lost in a battle against Schmidt's forces. Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer Howard Stark fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt's HYDRA organization, freeing Barnes and the other captured soldiers. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who reveals his face to be a mask, removing it to display the red, skull-like face that earned him the sobriquet ""the Red Skull."" Schmidt escapes and Rogers returns to base with the freed soldiers.
Rogers recruits Barnes, Dum Dum Dugan, Gabe Jones, Jim Morita, James Montgomery Falsworth, and Jacques Dernier to attack the other known HYDRA bases. Stark outfits Rogers with advanced equipment, in particular a circular shield made of vibranium, a rare, near-indestructible metal. Rogers and his team successfully sabotage various HYDRA operations. The team later assaults a train carrying Zola. Zola is captured, but Barnes falls from the train to his apparent death.[b] Using information extracted from Zola, the final HYDRA stronghold is located and Rogers leads an attack to stop Schmidt from using weapons of mass destruction on American cities. Rogers clambers aboard Schmidt's aircraft as it takes off. During the subsequent fight, the Tesseract's container is damaged. Schmidt physically handles the Tesseract, causing him to dissolve in a bright light. The Tesseract falls to the floor, burning through the plane and falling to Earth. Seeing no way to land the plane without the risk of detonating its weapons, Rogers crashes it in the Arctic. Stark later recovers the Tesseract from the ocean floor, but is unable to locate Rogers or the aircraft.
Rogers awakens in a 1940s-style hospital room. Deducing from an anachronistic radio broadcast that something is wrong, he flees outside into what is revealed to be present-day Times Square in New York City, where S.H.I.E.L.D. director Nick Fury tells him he has been ""asleep"" for nearly 70 years.","exciting,hero,suspenseful,joy,anticipation,evolve,morph,superhero",3213.jpg,2011-07-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/captain-america-first-avenger/id464094560?uo=4,"JerVrbLldXw,GAiKvcCCYMo",70153850,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Captain_America_The_First_Avenger/70153850,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense"
2299,Capturing the Friedmans,"In the late 1980's, the Friedmans - father and respected computer and music teacher Arnold Friedman, mother and housewife Elaine Friedman, and their three grown sons, David Friedman, Seth Friedman and Jesse Friedman - of Great Neck, Long Island, are seemingly your typical middle class American family. They all admit that the marriage was by no means close to being harmonious - Arnold and Elaine eventually got divorced - but the sons talk of their father, while also not being always there for them, as being a good man. This fa‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬∫ade of respectability masks the fact that Arnold was buying and distributing child pornography. Following a sting operation to confirm this fact, the authorities began to investigate Arnold for sexual abuse of the minor-aged male students of his computer classes, which he held in the basement of the family home. Based on interviews with the students, not only was Arnold charged with and ultimately convicted of multiple counts of sodomy and sexual abuse of these boys but so was eighteen year old Jesse, who was mentioned by many as the aggressor of the two in the acts. Arnold admitted that he is a pedophile, but that he did not abuse the boys in his class as charged and convicted. The trial process brought out the dysfunction that previously existed within the family. But the issue of Arnold and Jesse's guilt of these acts is hotly debated among the family, among the authorities, among the media and among the students of the computer classes.","The investigation into Arnold Friedman's life started after a federal sting operation when he received a magazine of child pornography from the Netherlands by mail. In searching his Great Neck, New York home, investigators found a collection of child pornography. After learning that Friedman taught children computer classes from his home, local police began to suspect him of abusing his students.
In police interviews, some of the children Friedman taught stated Friedman played bizarre sex games with them during their computer classes. Jarecki interviewed some of these children himself; some stated that they had been in the room with other children alleging abuse, and that nothing had happened. The film portrayed police investigative procedures as the genesis of a ""witch-hunt"" in the Friedmans' community.
The Friedmans took home-videos while Arnold Friedman (and, later, his son Jesse) awaited trial. They were allowed to stay at home in order to prepare for court. The pictures were not made with publishing in mind, but as a way to record what was happening in their lives. The movie shows much of this footage; family dinners, conversations and arguments. Arnold's wife quickly decided that her husband was indeed guilty, and advised him to confess and protect their son.
Arnold Friedman pleaded guilty to multiple charges of sodomy and sexual abuse. According to the Friedman family, he confessed in the hopes that his son would be spared prison time. Jesse Friedman later confessed as well, but now claims he did so to avoid being sent to prison for life. He said in mitigation that his father had molested him. Arnold Friedman admitted to molesting two boys, but not those who attended his computer classes. He is also quoted as admitting that, when he was 13, he had sex with his younger brother, Howard, who was eight years old at the time of the abuse; Howard Friedman has said he does not recall this. In addition, Peter Panaro, the lawyer for Jesse Friedman, stated that Jesse had admitted to him that he was sexually assaulted by his father as a child and that ""not everything he had said about 'nothing had happened' was true."" Jesse denies telling Panaro this, and states that Panaro told him to plead guilty and blame his father.","bleak,emotional,disturbing,sincere,contemplative,thought provoking,gloomy",2299.jpg,2003-01-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/capturing-the-friedmans/id480588602?uo=4,R10VjJgx1dU,60027997,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Capturing_the_Friedmans/60027997,"Documentary,Special Interest"
596,Carlito's Way,"From the director of Scarface comes the critically acclaimed crime thriller Carlito's Way. Oscar¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫ winner Al Pacino gives on electrifying performance as former drug kingpin Carlito Brigante, who is sprung from prison by his high-powered attorney (Academy Award¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫ winner Sean Penn). He stuns the New York underworld by vowing to go straight from a history of violence, but his plans are undermined by misguided loyalties and an outmoded code of honor. In a life-or-death battle, Carlito takes on the relentless forces that refuse to let him go. Co-starring John Leguizamo and Luis Guzman, Carlito's Way is a powerful, action-packed ride all the way to its explosive conclusion.","In 1975, after serving 5 years of a 30 year prison sentence, Carlito Brigante (Al Pacino) is freed on a legal technicality exploited by his close friend and lawyer, Dave Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Carlito vows to be through with his criminal activities but is persuaded to accompany his young cousin Guajiro (John Ortiz) to a drug deal held at a bar. Guajiro is betrayed and killed by his suppliers and Carlito is forced to shoot his way out. Afterwards, Carlito takes Guajiro's $30,000 from the botched deal and uses it to buy into a nightclub owned by a gambling addict named Saso (Jorge Porcel) with the intent on saving $75,000 to retire to the Caribbean.
As nightclub co-owner, Carlito declines several offers for a business partnership with an ambitious, albeit obnoxious, young gangster from the Bronx named Benny Blanco (John Leguizamo). Carlito also rekindles his romance with his former girlfriend Gail (Penelope Ann Miller), a ballet dancer who moonlights as a stripper. Kleinfeld develops a love interest with Benny's girlfriend, Steffie, a waitress at Carlito's nightclub. Benny's frustration with Carlito's constant rejections boils over and he confronts Carlito one night at his table. Carlito publicly humiliates Benny, who reacts by manhandling Steffie. Fueled by his now extensive use of alcohol and cocaine, Kleinfeld brazenly pulls out a gun and threatens to kill Benny, but Carlito intervenes. Despite being personally threatened by Benny himself, Carlito lets Benny go unharmed; a decision which alienates Carlito's gangster friend and personal bodyguard Pachanga (Luis Guzm‚àö¬∞n).
Kleinfeld, who stole one million dollars in payoff money from his Italian mob-boss client, Anthony ""Tony T"" Taglialucci, is coerced into providing his yacht to help Tony T break out of the Rikers Island prison barge. Kleinfeld begs for Carlito's assistance in the prison break, and Carlito reluctantly agrees. Under cover of night, Carlito, Kleinfeld, and Tony T's son, Frankie, sail to a floating buoy outside of the prison barge where Tony T is waiting. As they pull Tony T aboard, Kleinfeld unexpectedly bludgeons him to death then slits Frankie's throat and dumps both of their bodies in the East River. Carlito immediately severs his ties with Kleinfeld and decides to leave town with Gail. The next day, Kleinfeld barely survives a retaliatory assassination attempt when he's stabbed in the chest at his office by two mobsters.
Carlito is apprehended by police and taken to District Attorney Norwalk's (James Rebhorn) office where he is played a tape of Kleinfeld making a deal and offering to testify to false criminal allegations against Carlito. Norwalk advises that he is aware of Carlito as an accomplice to the Taglialucci murders in an attempt to leverage him into betraying Kleinfeld to save himself, but Carlito refuses. Carlito visits Kleinfeld under police protection in the hospital, where Kleinfeld confesses to selling him out; Carlito warns Kleinfeld that he's crossed the line from being a lawyer to acting like a gangster, and other gangsters will treat him accordingly. Having noticed a suspicious man dressed in a police uniform waiting in the lobby, Carlito deftly unloads Kleinfeld's revolver and parts ways with him. The man turns out to be Tony T's other son, Vinnie (Joseph Siravo), seeking vengeance for his brother and father. Vinnie sneaks into Kleinfeld's room and executes him without incident because of Kleinfeld's empty gun.
Carlito then buys train tickets to Miami for himself and Gail, now pregnant. When he stops by his club to get the stashed money, Carlito is met by a group of Italian mobsters led by Vinnie. The Italians plan on killing Carlito, but he manages to slip out through a secret exit. The Italians pursue him throughout the city's subway system and into Grand Central Terminal where they engage in a gunfight. Carlito kills all of his pursuers except Vinnie, who is shot and killed by police attracted by the gunfire.
As Carlito runs to catch the train where Gail and Pachanga are waiting for him, he is ambushed by a disguised Benny, who shoots Carlito several times in the abdomen with a silenced gun. Pachanga admits to the dying Carlito that he is now working for Benny, only to be shot as well. Carlito hands a tearful Gail the money and tells her to escape with their unborn child and start a new life elsewhere. As he is wheeled away on a gurney, Carlito stares at a billboard with a Caribbean beach and a picture of a woman. The billboard then comes to life in his mind, and the woman, who is clearly Gail, starts dancing as Carlito slowly passes away.","tough,anticipation,drugs,fear",596.jpg,1993-11-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/carlitos-way/id280173319?uo=4,0yehgqPtG3Y,351701,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Carlito_s_Way/351701,Drama
2954,Carnage,"CARNAGE is a razor sharp, biting comedy centered on parental differences. After two boys duke it out on a playground, the parents of the ""victim"" invite the parents of the ""bully"" over to work out their issues. A polite discussion of childrearing soon escalates into verbal warfare, with all four parents revealing their true colors. None of them will escape the carnage.","When two grade-school boys get into a fight in the park that results in one boy hitting the other in the mouth with a stick, their parents meet in a Brooklyn apartment to discuss the matter. The parents of the boy wielding the stick, Alan and Nancy Cowan (Waltz and Winslet), visit the home of Michael and Penelope Longstreet (Reilly and Foster), the parents of the boy who was struck. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out.
At first, the couples seem to get along, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting among themselves, the couples blame each other on who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets ""superficially fair-minded"" and Penny and Michael constantly complain about Alan's arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan's many phone calls.
Nancy accuses Michael of being a murderer because he supposedly killed a pet hamster of his and Penny's. Penny becomes emotional about the hamster and with everyone arguing with each other. Michael offers everyone a glass of scotch. Penny claims she doesn't ""get drunk"" and Nancy drinks way too many and finally stops Alan's phone calls by putting his cellphone in Penny and Michael's flower vase full of water. Penny and Nancy both laugh uproariously while Michael and Alan try to blow-dry the cell phone. Nancy's true colors are revealed when she drunkenly and vulgarly states that she was glad that her and Alan's son beat up Penny and Michael's son. The couples repeatedly state that their conversation is getting nowhere.
In the end, the film cuts to the Longstreets' and Cowans' sons reconciling on their own.",,2954.jpg,2011-09-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/carnage/id508347323?uo=4,"ON3kwJPwcMU,343N7mg_hh8",70206132,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Carnage/70206132,"Comedy,Drama"
2834,Carny,"Frankie (Gary Busey) and Patch (Robbie Robertson) have a system. Frankie wears clown makeup and sits in the dunk-tank cage, howling insults at midway passersby. Patch is out front collecting dollars from marks eager to make Frankie and his big mouth take a dive. It's a good town-to-town living for the two pals. Then Donna (Jodie Foster) came along. A charismatic star trio energizes this grit-and-glitter slice of carnival life that's as atmospheric as a stroll down midway USA. Indeed, music man Robertson, who co-produced and penned the story on which the screenplay was based, once worked as a carny. He and his collaborators ensure that time spent with the impressive sights and unique personalities of this traveling show will be downright unforgettable.","Frankie and Patch are friends who take a small-time carnival from town to town, often bribing local authorities to let them stay.
Among their ruses to fleece the rubes is a dunk tank, in which Frankie perches, made up as a clown, and mercilessly heckles the customers. He is a public face of the carny, whereas Patch sticks to running the business behind the scenes.
Into their life comes Donna, a wayward 18-year-old who is bored with her life at home. Donna strikes up a friendship with Frankie and follows the carny on the circuit. She eventually joins the troupe, learning how to con customers and also doing an exotic dance that is more suggestive than lewd.
The dark and brooding Patch persuades others that Donna is capable of much more, implying that she would even consent to prostitute herself to make money for the traveling show, as others clearly have. Donna doesn't go that far, but Frankie does catch her in bed with Patch, straining the relationships of all three.","disturbing,gloomy",2834.jpg,1980-06-13,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/carny/id470594774?uo=4 ,dY8fS0x9TBk,,,"Drama,Horror"
1216,Carrie,"Stephen King's Carrie White (Sissy Spacek) is a lonely, withdrawn high-school student who is the object of ridicule because of her drabness and because of the influence of her mother (Piper Laurie)--a religious zealot who has kept her in the dark about all things feminine. When Carrie experiences her first period in the gym shower, she is teased and humiliated. Threatened with expulsion from the upcoming prom, the girls' ringleader (Amy Irving) devises a plan: Amy's boyfriend (William Katt) will pretend to court Carrie and then Carrie will be elected Prom Queen. At the prom, Amy and her cohorts (including John Travolta) drop a rigged bucket of pig's blood on Carrie. Carrie's kinetic powers are now unleashed in one of the screen's most-celebrated depictions of merciless and unstoppable fury.","Carrie White is a shy, friendless teenage girl abused by her unstable Christian fundamentalist mother Margaret. The girls at Bates High School also harass Carrie, with Chris Hargensen being especially cruel.
Carrie experiences her first period while showering after gym class, and, because of her sheltered life, becomes hysterical, thinking she is dying. Chris and another popular girl, Sue Snell notice Carrie's horror. Rather than help, they and the other girls throw tampons and sanitary pads at her before Miss Collins intervenes. As Carrie becomes more frantic, a light bulb bursts just before Miss Collins makes the other girls leave. Miss Collins brings Carrie to Principal Morton's office. While consoling her, Principal Morton repeatedly calls Carrie ""Cassie"", unintentionally emphasizing how overlooked she is. When Carrie corrects the principal, an ashtray from the principal's desk flips onto the floor and smashes. While Carrie is walking home, a neighborhood boy falls off his bicycle immediately after taunting her. Margaret pays a visit to Mrs. Snell house about Christianity but instead gave her $10 dollars as a contribution to get rid of her.
Margaret receives a call from Miss Collins about the locker room incident and tells Carrie that the ""curse of blood"" is punishment for sin. She locks Carrie in a closet and forces her to pray. That night, a miserable Carrie stares at her bedroom mirror until it shatters.
The next day, English teacher Mr. Fromm reads a poem to the class written by Sue's athletic boyfriend Tommy Ross. Fromm invites the class to critique Tommy's work, but mocks Carrie when she calls it ""beautiful"", which irks Tommy, who defends Carrie. Sue, feeling guilty for teasing Carrie, convinces Tommy to take Carrie to the prom.
Miss Collins berates the girls in the gym who tormented Carrie, subjecting them to a week-long boot-camp-style detention, threatening them with suspension from school and the prom if they do not attend. All the girls show remorse except for Chris, who throws a fit to Miss Collins who slaps her and is banned from the prom.
Carrie suspects she may have telekinesis, and researches it in the library. Tommy asks Carrie to the prom, but she fears another trick. After a pep talk from Miss Collins, Tommy pays a visits to Carrie's house and keeps asking her to the prom she then accepts Tommy's invitation.
Carrie tells her mother she is going to the prom, and Margaret declares the prom an occasion of sin, refusing to let her attend. However, Carrie causes the windows of the house to slam shut, revealing her telekinesis. Margaret believes this is Satan's power, but Carrie insists she will go to the prom.
Chris tells her delinquent boyfriend, Billy Nolan, that she wants revenge on Carrie. She goes with Billy and other kids to a farm, where Billy kills a pig. After draining the pig's blood into a bucket, Chris has Billy place the bucket above the school's stage.
Chris makes a deal with her friend, Norma Watson, and Billy's friend, Freddy, to rig the prom king and queen election so that Tommy and Carrie will win. As Carrie prepares for the evening, her mother tells her everyone will laugh at her. Carrie leaves with Tommy. Though her classmates are surprised to see Carrie at the prom, they treat her as an equal. Sue, who was unable to attend due to lacking a date, sneaks into the prom to ensure everything goes well for Carrie.
To Carrie's surprise, she and Tommy are named prom king and queen. As the couple approaches the stage, Sue discovers Chris holding a rope attached to the bucket of pig's blood. Miss Collins forces Sue out, believing she is there for mischief. As the crown is placed on Carrie's head, Chris pulls the rope and Carrie is drenched in pig's blood. As the crowd looks on in silence, Tommy is knocked unconscious by the bucket and Carrie sees the whole room laughing and jeering at her, when it is implied that only a few of Chris's friends are actually doing so. Carrie's telekinesis takes over, closing the doors to the gym and turning on a fire hose. Chris and Billy's friends are knocked out by the fire hose along with many other people and Miss Collins is killed by a falling ceiling rafter. Principal Morton and Mr. Fromm are electrocuted, which causes a fire in the gym. Leaving her classmates inside the school as it burns, Carrie walks home covered in blood. Chris and Billy intend to run her over with Billy's car, but Carrie flips the car over, causing it to burst into flames, and kills them both.
At home, Carrie breaks down in her mother's arms. However, by this time Margaret has gone completely mad; believing the devil has taken over Carrie, Margaret brings her to her knees and stabs Carrie in the back. Carrie falls down the stairs and is cornered in the kitchen by her mother, but sends kitchen knives flying at her mother, killing her and having her body shaped in the form of the Saint Sebastian figurine in the ""prayer closet"". Overcome with guilt and grief, Carrie uses her last ounce of strength to collapse the house upon her and her mother and the house burns down to the ground.

But Carrie has a secret: She's been blessed with the terrifying power of telekinesis; and when her peers decide to pull a prank on her at prom, they'll soon learn a deadly lesson: If you play with fire, you get burned. ","The plot surrounds a young school girl who discovers the unique gift of telekinesis. Abused by her borderline psychotic and God-fearing mother, Carrie White is a shy introvert, bullied at school by both peers and teachers. Constantly enduring the endless torture both at home and school, Carrie‚Äö√Ñ√¥s mind is destroyed while her new power simultaneously grows, resulting in a tragic climax.

The story culminates at Carrie‚Äö√Ñ√¥s prom, where her peers plot a cruel prank, lifting Carries spirits then utterly humiliating her.  As a result, the wrath of her full power ensues and all hell breaks loose as she wreaks havoc on the sleepy American town.

Originally adapted in 1976, Carrie first came to our screens through the direction of Brian De Palma (Scarface (1983), Carlito‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Way (1993)), laying forth a film remembered for it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s terrifying portrait of the human condition. Peirce replaces the gangster auteur in the adaptation of King‚Äö√Ñ√¥s novel, and undoubtedly has big boots to fill, especially with 2013‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Carrie being a sharp turn in genre for the director.

The film sees Chlo‚àö¬¥ Grace Moretz as the terrifying teen and Julianne Moore as her estranged mother. The pair look set to cause a storm in the suburbs of Maine as both have had plenty of past experiences with troubled characters (Moretz in Let Me In (2010) and Moore in The Forgotten (2004). Other notable cast members include Judy Greer as the sympathetic gym teacher, known mostly for her light comic roles.  Perhaps this role will present a new side to the Love And Other Drugs (2010) actress.",,7220.jpg,,,,,,"Horror,Drama"

Lightning is desperate to win the race, since it would allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze, a rust treatment for old cars, and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, Lightning pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, the exhausted Mack drifts off and is startled by a gang of reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the truck into the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic, and speeds off the highway to find Mack, ending up in a run-down town of Radiator Springs and inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road.
After being arrested and impounded overnight, McQueen is ordered by the town's judge and doctor, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer, Sally Carrera, insists that McQueen be given community service to repave the road, to which Doc begrudingly agrees. McQueen tries to repave it in a single day, but it turns out to be shoddy and McQueen is ordered to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he becomes friends with several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing the town, it was effectively taken off the map. McQueen also discovers that Doc is really the ""Fabulous Hudson Hornet"", a three-time Piston Cup winner who was forced out of racing after an accident and quickly forgotten by the sport. McQueen finishes the road, which has invigorated the cars to improve their town, and spends an extra day in town with his new friends, before Mack and the media descend on the town, led by a tip to McQueen's location. McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race, while Sally and the rest of Radiator Springs chastise Doc after discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered himself instead.
At the speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully set on the race, and he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc Hudson, decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief, along with several other friends from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. Hicks, refusing to lose, sends Weathers into a dangerous accident. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line, allowing Hicks to win, and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory and give praise to McQueen's sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines, insisting on staying with his current sponsors as an appreciation of their past support. Later, back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns and announces that he will be setting up his headquarters there, helping to put Radiator Springs back on the map.","exciting,never lose faith,joy,be who you are,humorous,stylized,feel good",2270.jpg,2006-06-08, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cars/id188764984?uo=4,_z-gerHEq6c,70043811,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cars/70043811,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family"
3416,Cars 2,"After Mater gets his best friend, star race car Lightning McQueen, a spot in the very first World Grand Prix, he is given the job of pit crew chief. But while they are in Japan, Mater crosses paths with Holly Shiftwell, a spy searching for an American spy. Unknown to Mater, the American spy attached a tracking device on him while being attacked. Thinking the tow truck is the spy, Holly and another spy, Finn McMissile, take Mater around the world to find and stop an evil plot created by ""lemons,"" old cars considered ugly.","Like the previous film, Cars 2 takes place in a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles. British spy Finn McMissile infiltrates the world's largest untapped oil reserves, owned by a group of ""lemon"" cars. After being discovered, he is forced to flee and fake his death.
Four-time Piston Cup champion Lightning McQueen returns home to Radiator Springs and reunites with his best friend Mater and his girlfriend Sally Carrera. Doc Hudson is indicated to have died some time before. Former oil tycoon Sir Miles Axlerod, now a green power advocate, announces a racing series called the ""World Grand Prix"" to promote Allinol biofuel. When Italian formula race car Francesco Bernoulli challenges McQueen, he and Mater - along with Luigi, Guido, Fillmore, and Sarge - depart for Tokyo, Japan for the World Grand Prix.
Meanwhile, the lemons, led by Professor Z‚àö¬∫ndapp and an unknown mastermind, secretly plot to secure their oil profits by using a weapon disguised as a television camera to ignite the Allinol fuel. McMissile and partner Holley Shiftwell attempt to rendezvous with American spy car Rod ""Torque"" Redline at a World Grand Prix promotional event in Tokyo, to receive information about the mastermind; however, Redline is attacked by Z‚àö¬∫ndapp's henchmen and passes his information to Mater before he is captured. Holley and Finn mistake Mater as their American contact. Under torture, Z‚àö¬∫ndapp reveals to Torque that Allinol has one fatal flaw: it can ignite if impacted by a high electromagnetic pulse. Z‚àö¬∫ndapp demonstrates it on Torque, killing him, but not before they realize that he passed this information to Mater.
During the first race, Finn and Holley help Mater evade Z‚àö¬∫ndapp's henchmen; in the process, Mater inadvertently gives McQueen bad racing advice which causes him to lose the race to Bernouilli. Meanwhile, Z‚àö¬∫ndapp uses the weapon on several race cars. After McQueen falls out with Mater, who sadly claims that he is leaving, Finn - who still believes Mater is an American spy - drafts him into foiling Z‚àö¬∫ndapp's plot. Finn and Mater escape Z‚àö¬∫ndapp's henchmen and climb aboard Siddeley. Finn and Holley remove the tracking device on Mater and discover in it a picture of a mysterious British engine, which Mater identified by the engine and rare parts.
Finn, Holley, and Mater fly to Paris, France, where they go into a black-market and meet an old friend of Finn's, Tomber. Finn and Holley show the mysterious engine to Tomber, who tells them that the car with the engine was his best customer, but never met him in person. Mater explains what he knows about the evil Lemons, and realizes that every Lemon involved with the plot is one of ""history's biggest loser cars."" Tomber tells Finn, Holley and Mater that the lemons are going to have a secret meeting in Porto Corsa, Italy (where the next race in the World Grand Prix is taken place).
In Italy, Mater infiltrates the criminals' meeting and discovers Z‚àö¬∫ndapp's plan. Z‚àö¬∫ndapp's henchmen, meanwhile, use their weapon on several more cars during the race, eventually causing a multi-car pileup on the Casino Bridge. With the Allinol fuel under suspicion, Axlerod suspends its use for the final race in England; however, McQueen chooses to continue using it. The criminals decide to kill McQueen in the next race; upon hearing this, Mater is exposed and is captured along with McMissile and Shiftwell, and tied up inside Big Bentley's bell tower in London, England.
Mater realizes how foolishly he has been acting. The criminals use the weapon on McQueen during the race, but nothing happens. Mater escapes to warn his friends of a bomb planted in McQueen's pit stop, but McMissile and Shiftwell find that the bomb was actually planted on Mater. They warn Mater about the bomb, and he flees to protect his friends. However, he is pursued by McQueen in an attempt to reconcile, unaware of the danger until they are beyond the range of Z‚àö¬∫ndapp's remote detonator. He sends his henchmen to kill McQueen and Mater, but they are foiled by the combined efforts of McMissile, Shiftwell, and the Radiator Springs residents. Upon his capture, Z‚àö¬∫ndapp reveals that only the person who installed the bomb can deactivate it, and Mater realizes that Axlerod is the mastermind behind the plot. Mater confronts Axlerod, trapping him next to the bomb. Axlerod finally deactivates the bomb, and he, Z‚àö¬∫ndapp and the lemons are arrested by the police.
As a reward for his heroism, Mater receives an honorary knighthood from the Queen and returns home with his friends, where the cars from the Grand Prix take part in the unofficial Radiator Springs Grand Prix. Fillmore reveals that before the last race, Sarge replaced McQueen's Allinol with Fillmore's organic fuel, which prevented McQueen from being affected by the weapon. McMissile and Shiftwell invite Mater to join them in another spy mission, but he graciously turns it down but asks Shiftwell for a date when she returns which she accepts. He gets to keep the rockets they gave him earlier, which he uses in the Radiator Springs race.","exciting,humorous,stylized,joy",3416.jpg,2011-06-18, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cars-2/id450754772?uo=4,"wmd-qmO_wFI,oFTfAdauCOo,MGHwlExcaqU,lg5hj2c5Nkk",70184048,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cars_2/70184048,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family"

2812,Cellular,"SUSPENSE IS ON THE LINE! After getting a frantic call on his cell phone from a kidnapped woman, a young man must battle his way through a ruthless world of lies and murder to rescue her. A fast-paced thriller in the vein of Phone Booth and Speed that will keep you riveted with edge-of-your-seat car chase scenes.","The film opens with Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger), a high school biology teacher, talking to her son Ricky. After she returns home, mysterious assailants enter her home through the back door, kill her housemaid, kidnap her, and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan Greer (Jason Statham), the gang leader, smashes the attic's telephone to prevent her from contacting anyone. She has no idea who the kidnappers are or what they want. She pieces together the broken phone and randomly makes a connection. She reaches the cell phone of Ryan Hewitt (Chris Evans), who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Chloe (Jessica Biel), for being irresponsible. He believes the call is a joke, but Jessica persuades him to go to the police. At the police station, Desk Sergeant Mooney (William H. Macy) tells him to go to the detectives on the fourth floor. He begins to lose the signal in the stairwell, so he turns back to avoid losing the connection.
Meanwhile, Ethan returns to the safe house and asks Jessica about something she doesn't know. When Jessica tells him that she doesn't know, he tells her that he is going to get her son. Ryan, who overhears them, is now convinced that the kidnapping is real. After Ethan leaves, she tells Ryan to reach her son's school before they do. Unfortunately, he is too late, and her son is kidnapped. Ryan hijacks a security officer's car and gives chase. Because his cell phone's battery is dying, he drives to a shop for a charger. After being repeatedly redirected from counter to counter, he uses a gun from the security vehicle to hold up the store and get the charger.
Sgt. Mooney, meanwhile, decides to check on the kidnapping claim. He uses the Department of Motor Vehicles records to find Jessica's address, but when he comes to her house, a woman meets him, telling him that she is Jessica and everything is fine. Believing it to be a false alarm, he leaves. It is revealed that the woman is Dana Bayback (Valerie Cruz), an accomplice of the kidnappers.
Ethan returns to the safe house and asks Jessica for the location of a place called ""The Left Field"", where her husband, Craig, was. He reveals that he has Ricky and threatens to kill him if Jessica does not tell him what ""The Left Field"" means. She tells him that ""The Left Field"" is a bar in Los Angeles International Airport. As Ethan leaves, she tells Ryan that they have gone to get her husband. A cross-connection between phone lines causes Ryan to grab a nearby lawyer's (Rick Hoffman) cell phone as well as his car after his is destroyed. Jessica urges him to find her husband, and at the airport, he tries to stop the kidnappers by planting the gun under one of their jackets. The gun trips the alarm and security intervenes, but the kidnappers flash police badges and soon apprehend Craig. Ryan and Jessica realize that Ethan and his gang are police officers. After viewing a news report, Mooney identifies Ryan and calls Jessica's home. When he hears the voicemail greeting, he notices that Jessica's voice on the answering machine is different from that of the woman he met.
Craig is brought into the attic and is forced to reveal the location of a videotape. He tells them that it is in a bank safe deposit box. Ethan and his friends, Dimitri (Eric Etebari) and Deason (Matt McColm), go with Craig while another kidnapper stays on guard. Ryan also reaches the bank, and when the kidnappers retrieve the video camera, Ryan grabs it and flees to the roof. However, he accidentally drops the cell phone off the roof, smashing it to pieces. He manages to escape in a taxi, and while watching the videotape learns that Craig accidentally shot footage of LAPD Det. Ethan, Mad Dog (Brendan Kelly), Dimitri, Bayback, Deason, and Jack Tanner (Noah Emmerich), a friend of Mooney, robbing and murdering drug dealers. Ryan steals the lawyer's car again from the impound lot and manages to retrieve his own cell phone.
Mooney returns to the Martin residence, where Bayback shoots at him, injuring him. He retaliates and kills her but learns, to his dismay, that she was a cop, too. Meanwhile, Mad Dog tries to call Ethan on the house phone line, but he stumbles on the phone conversation. Angered, he heads upstairs and attacks her, but Jessica kills him by cutting his brachial artery, causing him to bleed to death in seconds. She attempts to escape with her son, but Ethan returns with Craig hostage and stops her. Before Ethan can do anything, Ryan uses his cell phone's memory to contact Ethan and makes a deal directly over the phone: the videotape in exchange for the Martin family. Upon learning of the meeting, Tanner convinces Mooney to go so that he can identify Ryan.
The deal goes down at the Santa Monica Pier. Ryan tries to handle it his way in disguise, but his ex-girlfriend accidentally exposes him, after which Mooney is able to finger him. While Tanner sends Dimitri to help Mooney get needed medical attention, he takes Ryan to Ethan. Ethan destroys the video recording and Tanner radios the order to kill the Martins, although Deason in the van suggests they wait until they get to the safe house.
However, Mooney overhears the radio transmission. Ryan escapes, following a distraction by his friend Chad (Eric Christian Olsen), Mooney overpowers Dimitri and handcuffs him on the stairs. Tanner and Ethan confront Ryan in a boathouse, where Ryan knocks out Tanner, but Ethan beats him up with his superior fighting skills until Mooney intervenes. After a brief cat and mouse game, Ryan, wounded, notices that Ethan has circled behind Mooney, and helps Mooney by calling Ethan's cell phone (revealing that Ryan's phone somehow was not water damaged after his jumping into the river). The ring of the cell betrays Ethan's hiding place, and Mooney promptly shoots him dead. As Ethan falls, he looks dumbfoundedly at Ryan ... and then at Ryan's cell phone, the ""weapon"" that got him killed.
Meanwhile, Jessica manages to strangle Deason with her handcuff chain from the rear of their van, then frees her husband and son. But Deason was merely stunned, and aims his gun at them. Ryan intervenes and smashes him with the van doors until he is dead.
While Ryan and Mooney are being treated by medics, Tanner is also exposed, because Ryan had copied the video recording onto his cell phone, and the Martin family is set free. Jessica finally gets to meet the man who has risked his life saving her and her family. Ryan's only jokingly requests that she never call him again. They laugh.","exciting,suspenseful",2812.jpg,2004-09-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cellular/id373721434?uo=4,g6V96fY9fqw&hd=1,60034577,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cellular/60034577,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense"

3143,Center Stage,"From Nicholas Hytner, the acclaimed director of the Madness of King George, The Crucible and The Object of My Affection, and Academy Award Nominated producer Laurence Mark (Jerry Maguire, As Good As It Gets) comes Center Stage. A drama with heart and energy that follows the hopes and dreams of a tight-knit group of young ballet students as they try to make a name for themselves in the competitive world of professional dance. Talented, vibrant and supremely gifted, they are students who devote themselves to dance, sacrificing ordinary pleasures of life to train for their art with the rigor of Olympic athletes. While experiencing the normal joys and sorrows, love and conflicts of life, they vie for a place in an ultra-selective professional ballet company and strive to take center stage.","After a series of country-wide auditions, 12 young dancers gain entry to the American Ballet Academy (which is loosely based on the School of American Ballet). They work hard, attending classes every day for weeks to make them the best dancers they can possibly be, and in preparations for a final dance workshop which will determine the three boys and three girls who will be asked to join the American Ballet Company (which appears to be based on either the American Ballet Theatre or the New York City Ballet). The workshop will also provide an opportunity for the students to showcase their talent to other ballet companies across the country. Gaining a leading part in the workshop is therefore essential.
Tensions mount between Jonathan (Peter Gallagher), the company's aging choreographer and director, and Cooper Nielson (Ethan Stiefel), his best dancer, who also wants to choreograph. They also have issues because Kathleen, Cooper's ex-girlfriend and fellow ballet dancer, left him for Jonathan. Star student Maureen (Susan May Pratt), a closet bulimic who seems poised for success, discovers that life is passing her by when she meets a pre-med student who shows her life without ballet. Sweet Jody Sawyer (Amanda Schull), despite body type issues and bad feet, is determined to dance professionally but it appears less and less likely as the movie progresses that she will be good enough. The talented but smart-mouthed Eva (Zoe Saldana) loves to dance but seems destined to be stuck in the back of the corps because of her attitude. Tensions also arise between Charlie (a naturally gifted fellow student) and Cooper. Charlie has a crush on Jody, who had a one-night stand with Cooper and remains infatuated with him.
Despite Jonathan's objections, Cooper choreographs a rock music based ballet for the workshop. Three ballets are being presented; Jonathan and another choreographer create the other two respectively--the two more ""traditional"" ballets are not danced to actual ballet music, however. The first is to Mendelssohn's Italian Symphony, while Jonathan's ballet is set to Rachmaninov's 2nd Piano Concerto. Cooper's ballet mirrors the relationship between himself, Jonathan, and Kathleen (and also, though done unconsciously, Jody, Charlie and Cooper). Jody, Charlie, and Erik (Shakiem Evans) are set to dance the three lead roles when Erik sprains his ankle in a rehearsal. Cooper then steps in to fill the role, and the tensions between Jody, Charlie and Cooper play out on the stage.
After the final workshop, Cooper starts his own dance company - much to Jonathan's chagrin, as Cooper's financial backer is a woman that Jonathan was hoping would donate to his own company. Cooper asks Jody to be a principal dancer as her dancing style, though technically behind, is perfect for the kind of dance he wants in his company. He also asks to date her, but Jody turns him down in favor of Charlie. Maureen decides to give up ballet because she finally realizes that ballet is just something she does well, and not what she wants from life. She decides to attend regular university and also seek help for her eating disorder. Eva is picked by Jonathan to join the prestigious American Ballet Company after proving her worth in the workshop - secretly taking the place of Maureen, who had the lead, in Jonathan's ballet. Jody's boyfriend Charlie, and their friends Anna (a girl who was always favored by Jonathan) and Erik are also asked to join the American Ballet Company, and Sergei (a Russian dancer who also befriended them) joins his girlfriend in the San Francisco Ballet Company.
There is a subplot in which Cooper attracts the financial support of a flirtatious wealthy female philanthropist (played by Elizabeth Hubbard). An August 15, 2004 New York Times article entitled ""How Much Is That Dancer in the Program?"" revealed that Stiefel has a very similar real-life sponsorship relationship with a philanthropist named Anka Palitz.","belief,dreams,joy,believe in yourself,new york,captivating,touching,feel good,believ in yourself,ballet,anticipation,passion,dance",3143.jpg,2000-05-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/center-stage/id291440179?uo=4,,60000891,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Center_Stage/60000891,"Drama,Musical & Performing Arts"
335,Centurion,"CENTURION is set during the war between Roman soldiers and Pict tribesmen during the 2nd century Roman conquest of Britain. Michael Fassbender stars as Quintus Dias, Roman centurion and son of a legendary gladiator who leads a group of soldiers on a raid of a Pict camp to rescue a captured general (Dominic West). The son of the Pict leader is murdered during the raid, and the Romans find themselves hunted by a seemingly unstoppable group of the Pict‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s most vicious and skilled warriors, led by a beautiful and deadly tracker (Olga Kurylenko), and hell bent on revenge.","The narrative opens with a Roman soldier fleeing across a snowy landscape, saying;
""My name is Quintus Dias. I am a soldier of Rome, and this is neither the beginning, nor the end of my story.""
It is AD 117 and the Roman garrisons are struggling to conquer the Picts, who inhabit the Scottish Highlands and a large part of the rest of Scotland. Centurion Quintus Dias is the only survivor of a Pictish raid on a Roman garrison and is taken prisoner by Vortix. Agricola, the Roman governor of Britannia, wants to obtain favour with the Roman Senate, hoping to secure a transfer back to the comforts of Rome. He dispatches the Ninth Legion, under General Titus Flavius Virilus, to eradicate the Pictish threat and provides him with a Brigantian scout called Etain.
As the legion marches north they encounter Dias and rescue him from three of Gorlacon's men. Dias tells Virilus of his encounter with Gorlacon and the general discovers that Dias' father was a famous gladiator whom he had seen fight. Dias befriends two Roman officers, a veteran named Bothos and a young Roman soldier named Thax.
Etain betrays the legion to Gorlacon, leading them into a trap where they are annihilated. The general is captured, while Dias, Bothos, and Thax survive, along with four others: ""Brick""; two Greco-Roman legionaries named Macros and Leonidas; and Tarak, a cook from the Hindu Kush. They set out to rescue general Virilus and, after a few days' travel, they find him and sneak in at nightfall. Failing to break his chains, he orders them to leave him and get back to Roman territory. As they retreat, Thax kills Gorlacon's young son and recovers Virilus' helmet. The next morning the general is given a sword and made to duel with Etain, who kills him.
The seven plan to travel north (which is away from Roman territory) in order to throw the Picts off their trail, then head west, and then south. Meanwhile, Etain, Aeron, Vortix and a detachment of seven Pictish warriors are sent to kill them. After several days' pursuit they catch up with the fugitives, who jump off a cliff into a river. Tarak is killed before he can jump, Macros and Thax become separated from the others and see a wolf close-by.
Dias and his group camp for the night, while their trackers set up camp nearby. Dias and Brick launch a night raid on the enemy camp, killing two men and severely wounding a third, but cannot find Etain. Dias learns of the death of Gorlacon's son, and that the king has sworn vengeance on their heads. Etain is absent, as she has launched her own attack on the Roman's campsite. Dias and Brick return to their camp, only to discover that Leonidas has been killed and Bothos injured.
Macros and Thax are running from a wolf pack. Thax falls, with the wolves in close pursuit, and cries out to his comrade for help. Macros returns to help him and Thax slices through Macros' hamstrings to prevent him from standing, allowing Thax to escape while the wolves attack and devour Macros. Dias, Bothos and Brick find a hut in the forest where they befriend Arianne, a Pict exile accused of witchcraft. She shelters them, provides food and medical attention. When Etain comes the following day, Arianne confronts her while the Romans hide in her grain store under the floorboards. The next morning they leave Arianne, who provides them with enough food to travel to a nearby Roman garrison.
They find the garrison abandoned, an order pinned to a post says that the Roman troops have retreated south, by the orders of Emperor Hadrian. As they see Etain and her group of Picts approach, they set up a defensive position inside the fort. Bothos kills Vortix and a female warrior, Dias kills two Picts, and Brick kills Aeron and the last Pict warrior; however, before the Picts are defeated, Brick is killed by a spear thrown by Etain who Dias then kills.
Dias and Bothos continue southwards and are reunited with Thax. Upon reaching Hadrian's Wall, Thax threatens Dias and they fight, with Dias killing Thax. Bothos, joyfully riding towards the Romans, is mistaken for a Pict and shot by an archer. When Dias enters the camp he reports to governor Agricola, who is concerned that news of the Legion's annihilation may cause other tribes to rise up against them. He is also fearful of his record being tainted by a military failure, and decides that the Ninth Legion's fate should remain a mystery and Dias must be killed.
Dias manages to foil the attempt on his life, though he is grievously wounded in the thigh during the fracas, and Agricola's daughter tells him that he is too much of a risk. He escapes the camp and returns to Arianne in the forest. As the weakened Dias lies in her arms by the stream, he and Arianne kiss. The film ends with Quintus Dias adjusting the narrative of the film's opening line;
""My name is Quintus Dias. I am a fugitive of Rome, and this is neither the beginning, nor the end of my story.""","exciting,soldier,suspenseful,trust,stylized,rough,atmospheric,fear",335.jpg,2010-02-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/centurion/id385420246?uo=4,"yiQCofKrYAI,2Zba6lg1Z9Y",70119196,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Centurion/70119196,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

2015,Changing Lanes,"An attorney in a rush to make a court appointment to file legal papers involving a multi-million dollar trust accidentally collides with an alcoholic insurance salesman, who also is a rush for a court appointment involving the custody of his children. The attorney leaves the scene of the accident and strands the salesman, causing him to miss his custody hearing. During the process of the post-crash discussion, the attorney accidentally drops the papers he needs to present in court. The judge gives him until the end of the day to present the papers and thus begins a cat and mouse game between the proponents. A few questionable actions later on both parties' part, they finally start questioning their actions and their lives. In the end, both come to new understanding of what is important and appear to be set in new ethical and moral directions. Contains mild violence and profanity.","A successful New York attorney, Gavin Banek, is in a rush to file a power of appointment, which will prove a dead man signed his foundation over to Banek's law firm. He has a collision with another car, belonging to an insurance salesman, Doyle Gipson, who is also in a rush to a hearing to try to gain custody of his children and to prevent his estranged wife from taking them to Oregon. Banek tries to brush Gipson off with a blank check thereby disobeying the law. After Gipson refuses to accept the check and voices his desire to ""do the right thing"", that is, filing a police report and insurance claim, Banek strands Gipson, telling him, ""better luck next time"". After arriving to the court late, Gipson learns that it proceeded without him and that it didn't go in his favor.
Unfortunately for Banek, he dropped the crucial power of appointment file at the scene of the accident, and the judge gives him until the end of the day to re-obtain the papers and present them. Gipson, who took the papers, has no intention of returning them, and in desperation, Banek goes to someone skilled with computers and gets him to switch off Gipson's credit. Gipson needed credit for a loan so he could buy a house for his family, and he becomes further enraged, determined to make life difficult for Banek.
Both men continue to do morally reprehensible things in an attempt to one-up each other, and eventually they begin to question their actions. Though it is made clear that Banek and Gipson are radically different, they both have an angry, vengeful streak, each capable of abandoning his morals just to punish the other. The film ends with both men having a new outlook on life, concentrating on ethics and the moral implications of their actions. Ultimately the two men apologize to each other and Gipson returns the file, but it looks to be too late for both of what they were trying to do. Banek ends up using the file to force his boss to do the right thing and plans to represent Gipson pro bono so he can get the house he wants. Banek also visits Gipson's wife to explain everything to her, knowing he owes Gipson that much. The movie ends with Gipson's wife and children smiling at him from across the street, indicating a possible reconciliation or at the very least some kind of arrangement between the two in the future.","thought provoking,bleak,sincere,gloomy",2015.jpg,2002-04-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/changing-lanes/id211216530?uo=4,-1X_73QwPks,60022934,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Changing_Lanes/60022934,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
3018,Charlie St. Cloud,"A young man forms a unique connection to the afterlife after surviving the tragic car accident that claimed his younger brother in this supernatural drama starring Zac Efron, based on the best-selling book by author Ben Sherwood. Charlie St. Cloud (Efron) is an experienced sailor from the Pacific Northwest who has just earned a scholarship that will take him far from home. The light of his mother's life, Charlie and his little brother, Sam (Charlie Tahan), are driving late at night when they're involved in a deadly car accident that kills Sam and leaves Charlie forever changed. In the aftermath of the accident, Charlie is wracked with guilt, convinced that if he had just been more careful behind the wheel, Sam would still be alive today. When Charlie begins seeing visions of his younger brother that are just as real as if Sam is actually standing before him, his friends and neighbors all start to think he's losing his mind. Shortly thereafter, Charlie's former high-school classmate Tess (Amanda Crew) returns to town unannounced, and together the two old acquaintances forge the foundation of a meaningful romance. But before Charlie can move on with his life he'll have to first let go of his past, and bid his beloved brother Sam one final, heartfelt farewell. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron) is a sailor who wins a professional boating race on his sailboat, the Splendid Splinter, along with his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan). He subsequently receives a sailing scholarship to Stanford University. Charlie graduates from Winslow High School and after getting home from his graduation ceremony, Charlie promises Sam that they will practice baseball together every day until he leaves for Stanford; at sunset when the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Bailey‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Yacht Club‚Äö√Ñ√π ceremonial cannons sound. Later that night, Charlie was supposed to go to a graduation party with his friends, but his mother Claire (Kim Basinger) makes him babysit Sam while she picks up another shift at her job as a nurse. When Sam is watching television, Charlie tries to sneak out and go to the party. But he is caught by Sam when he turns his headlights on, and Sam asks Charlie to drive him to his friend Tommy's house to watch the Red Sox game. At first Charlie refuses, but gives in when Sam makes compliments about his car. While driving, Charlie and Sam talk about Charlie's departure and horseplay until they get into a bad car accident at an intersection. Their car is rear ended by a SUV, forcing them into the path of a Mack truck in a T-bone collision. In the dark, during an out-of-body experience, Charlie hugs a badly wounded Sam and tries to reassure him that everything will be fine once he takes the blame for his actions. Knowing that his injuries are fatal, Sam asks Charlie to never leave him alone again, saying that if he does, they will always be together as brothers. Just when Charlie promises they will always be together, a paramedic named Florio Ferrente (Ray Liotta) revives Charlie, who sobs in horror when he realizes that Sam has succumbed to his wounds and died in his arms. At Sam's funeral, a broken-hearted Charlie runs off after being unable to put Sam's baseball glove in the grave. After a heartbroken run through the neighboring woods, Charlie finds Sam's spirit and discovers that Sam can interact with him on the physical plane. After their reunion, Charlie fulfills Sam's dying wish by practicing baseball with him every day at sunset, in the canyon, after the sounding of the cannons.
Five years later, Charlie, who gave up his scholarship and mournful over Sam's loss, is now caretaker at Waterside Cemetery. During a trip into town, Charlie visits the boat docks and meets Tess Carroll (Amanda Crew), a sailor who is scheduled to sail solo around the world. The following day, Charlie runs into Florio Ferrente, the paramedic who saved his life. Ferrente is dying of cancer and questions Charlie if he ever wonders why he was saved and tells him there is a reason for his gift. Charlie returns to the cemetery and finds Tess injured tending her father's grave. He takes her back to his home to patch her up and they develop a relationship. Meanwhile, Sam begins to feel that he is being transparently erased from existence as a certain sign that Charlie is forgetting him when Charlie arrives late for their game of catch. However, Tess follows Charlie and he explains to her that the more he is in her world, the less he can be in Sam's.
Later, Charlie discovers that Tess had gone missing while sailing through a storm a few days earlier, revealing that Charlie could see her just like he could Sam. Ferrente's wife Carla comes to Charlie and tells him that Ferrente had died the previous night and to give him his St. Jude medal that he wore the night Charlie was revived. Charlie examines the pendant. After one of the evenings Charlie and Tess have together they play hide and seek. Tess sticks a note on the door which says ""come find me"" with a drawing of a boat under. Later on in the story this is seen as her asking Charlie to find her after the storm has washed her on shore but she is dying. It is then that Charlie realizes that Tess is not dead and that he has to find her to save her life. Along with his friend Alistair and Tess's coach Tink, Charlie takes a boat to find Tess based on Charlie's instincts that he knows where she is due to what she told him and what he'd do himself. The following sunset, Charlie finally misses his game with Sam. As Charlie confesses his love for his departed sibling, Sam simply tells Charlie that he loves him back and takes off as a shooting star to point out Tess' location. The group finds Tess' wrecked boat along with her lying on the rocks. Charlie uses his body heat to keep both himself and Tess warm until the two are eventually found by a Coast Guard Jayhawk called in by Tink.
Charlie and Tess are taken to the hospital where Alistair tells Charlie that Tess had hypothermia and that he saved her. Later, Charlie purchases an old boat and asks Tess if she would like to take a ride with him. However, Tess fears him explaining that she had been having vivid dreams about them together. Charlie tells Tess that her dreams are memories and recites a quote from her dad's funeral that they had spoken about in her dreams. Charlie decides to resign from his job and goes into the forest to reminisce and say farewell to Sam, telling him they'll always be brothers and although he is unable to see him, Sam is there too and reveals that he's at peace, before Charlie leaves the forest with Tess. During the credits, Charlie and Tess finally sail around the world and say goodbye to the citizens of Quincy Harbor, Washington.","sadness,joy,ghost,sacrifice,missing you,never let me go,play with me,baseball,let go,never let go,memories,brother,guilt,anticipation,brothers",3018.jpg,2010-07-30, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/charlie-st.-cloud/id394333929?uo=4,MzgOvvMi8Lg,,,Drama
1537,Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"When Willy Wonka decides to let five children into his chocolate factory, he decides to release five golden tickets in five separate chocolate bars, causing complete mayhem. The tickets start to be found, with the fifth going to a very special boy, called Charlie Bucket. With his Grandpa, Charlie joins the rest of the children to experience the most amazing factory ever. But not everything goes to plan within the factory.","Charlie Bucket is a kind, loving boy who lives in poverty with his mother, father, and four bedridden grandparents. His mother is unemployed and his father works at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes of toothpaste that come through the line. Down the street is Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, which had recently been reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and to fire his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe had worked for Wonka directly and was laid off when that happened.
One day, Wonka announces a contest; the children that find the five Golden Tickets wrapped in ordinary Wonka candy bars will be given a full tour of the factory and a chance for an unknown grand prize. Four children quickly claim their prize: the greedy and gluttonous Augustus Gloop from D‚àö¬∫sseldorf, the spoiled and rotten Veruca Salt from Buckinghamshire, the competitive and boastful Violet Beauregarde from Atlanta, and the arrogant and aggressive Mike Teavee from Denver. Charlie hopes to win as well, but neither the bar he is given as a birthday present nor the one bought for him by Grandpa Joe contains a ticket. A fifth child in Russia claims to have found the last Ticket. Charlie, on finding a ten-dollar bill, buys a Wonka bar as news breaks that the Russian child's Ticket was fake; Charlie finds the bar he just bought contains the last Golden Ticket. As he races home, bystanders attempt to buy the Ticket from him. Grandpa George reminds Charlie that money is far more common than the Tickets, and convinces Charlie to keep it. Grandpa Joe offers to accompany him on the factory tour.
On the day of the tour, the children and their chaperons find Wonka to be a strange, lonely individual, acting odd at the mention of ""family"". As they proceed with the tour, they discover the fantastical factory is now manned by short humans called Oompa-Loompas. The other four children succumb to temptation, and end up caught in the factory workings before being safely recovered by the Oompa-Loompas, albeit in worse shape than at the start of the tour: Augustus falls into the river of chocolate but is rescued before the processing center, Violet expands into a giant blueberry when she tries an experimental piece of chewing gum, Veruca is thrown away as a ""bad nut"" by trained squirrels, and Mike is shrunk down to a few inches tall after being the first person transported by Wonka's new television advertising invention.
Wonka congratulates Charlie as the last remaining child and the winner of the grand prize, to become Wonka's heir to the factory. However, Wonka forbids Charlie to bring his family to the factory, and Charlie rejects the offer. Charlie comes to learn that Wonka had a troubled past with his father, Wilbur Wonka. Wilbur, a dentist, had forbidden Wonka from eating candy, but once Wonka got a taste, he wanted to become a confectioner himself against his father's wishes. After running away from home to follow his dream, Wonka later returned to find Wilbur and his home gone completely. Charlie is able to help locate Wilbur and convinces Wonka to visit him. Wonka finds his father has followed his success throughout the years, and the two reunite as a proud father and son. Wonka allows Charlie's family to move into the factory while he and Charlie plan out new types of candy to make.","belief,joy,trust,oompa-loompa,wonka bar,fate,honesty,strange,chocolate,everything you ever wanted,willy wonka,anticipation,be true",1537.jpg,2005-07-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/charlie-chocolate-factory/id271439854?uo=4,,,,"Comedy,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
2748,Chasing Amy,"Holden and Banky are comic book artists. Everything's going good for them until they meet Alyssa, also a comic book artist. Holden falls for her, but his hopes are crushed when he finds out she's a lesbian.

A pair of comic book authors named Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards, who live in New Jersey, have been best friends since 20 years. They spend their time working in their studio, and in the evenings they are going out. But their friendship is about to be disputed for the first time in their life, when a beautiful young lesbian woman named Alyssa Jones enters their life and Holden falls in love with her. Now Holden has to deal with Banky's jealousy, and with his new girlfriend's very rich past.
","Holden McNeil (Ben Affleck) and Banky Edwards (Jason Lee) are comic book artists and lifelong friends. Holden is the calmer, more reasonable of the duo; Banky, meanwhile, is the caustic and short-tempered half. Everything is going well for them until they meet Alyssa Jones (Joey Lauren Adams) at a comic book convention in New York where they are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to Alyssa, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out, and a deep friendship develops. Eventually, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings, and confesses his love to Alyssa. She is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship.
This new development worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers dirt on Alyssa's past, and he reports to Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys during high school, which gave her the nickname ""Finger Cuffs"". Holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. He angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game, after he clumsily attempts baiting her into confessing. During a tearful argument, she tells Holden about her ""many"" youthful sexual experimentations. She apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with. However, she refuses to apologize for her past, and Holden leaves feeling angry and confused.
Later, during lunch with Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), Silent Bob reveals that he was once in a relationship similar to Holden's. Despite the fact that he was in love with his girlfriend, Amy, his insecurities about her adventurous sexual past caused him to sabotage the relationship and leave her. Angry at himself for letting her go, he has ""spent every day since then chasing Amy, so to speak.""
Inspired by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. He invites them both over and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain her boyfriend. He also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him‚Äö√Ñ√Ækissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests a threesome. Though initially appalled, Banky agrees to participate, whereas Alyssa explains to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, she states that she loves him, but she will not be his whore. Banky also leaves the apartment, and summarily ends their friendship.
One year later, both Banky and Holden are busy promoting their own respective comics at a convention in New York. It is revealed that Holden has dissolved their partnership over Bluntman and Chronic, leaving the viewer with the assumption that he sold the publishing and creative rights over to Banky (which is corroborated in the beginning of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back). Banky smiles sadly at seeing his old friend, who silently congratulates him for his success. Banky gestures over to a booth hosted by Alyssa, and provides wordless encouragement to Holden to go talk to her. He has a brief, quietly emotional conversation with Alyssa, and gives her a copy of Chasing Amy, his new comic based on their failed relationship. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend (Virginia Smith) arrives and asks who she was talking to. A shaken misty-eyed Alyssa feigns indifference and replies, ""Oh, just some guy I knew.""","touching,witty,humorous,sexual,clever,bittersweet,offbeat",2748.jpg,1997-01-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/chasing-amy/id432470236?uo=4,_sAZWyaaIOM,1151188,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Chasing_Amy/1151188,"Comedy,Romance"

Although L‚àö¬©a only plans on keeping Ch‚àö¬©ri around for a short while, their affair turns into a six-year ordeal, in which L‚àö¬©a has begun paying for Ch‚àö¬©ri's expenses, and Ch‚àö¬©ri wears L‚àö¬©a's silk pajamas and pearls. The two believe their affair to be casual, and L‚àö¬©a learns from Charlotte that she has arranged for Ch‚àö¬©ri to marry the daughter of another courtesan, a barely eighteen-year-old named Edm‚àö¬©e.

The ending of the film turns out to be the opening sequence to the movie, although we only see bits and pieces of the ending interrogation, the audience gets to hear of Malachy's and Luke's final words on the incident before the movie cuts out.","Three teenagers go on a wild weekend of drink, drugs, shop-lifting and stealing cars that quickly spins beyond their control.

Cherry Bomb follows teenagers Luke, Malachy, and Michelle as they embark on a wild weekend of drink, drugs, shop-lifting and stealing cars. But what starts out as a game turns deadly serious when the three discover that they can't get off the wild ride they've set in motion. 

Getting under the skins of Belfast teens...

Pixels dominate the screen. As the image zooms out, it resolves itself into the battered, bloody, sullen face of Malachy (Rupert Grint), being filmed during police questioning. Then the twitchy, tearful Luke (Robert Sheehan) appears, also being questioned, and murder is mentioned. Rewind, in grand cinematic style, to three days earlier to see what's going on...

It's a well-worn but effective dramatic method, and that's a sentiment that can be applied to Cherrybomb as a whole. There's not much here that breaks new ground, but everything's achieved with style and skill.

The story follows two best friends fresh out of school: Malachy is the product of a solid upbringing, with the good grades to prove it; while Luke lives a precarious existence working as a drug dealer for his older brother.

When Michelle (Kimberley Nixon) arrives, both boys pursue her, creating a love triangle she enjoys maintaining. As she dares them to outdo each other in the misbehaviour stakes, it's clear that the glimpsed police interview isn't going to be far away.

The three young leads all excel in their varied roles _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü Sheehan and Grint, in the way they're at each other's throats in one scene and hugging and joking in the next, perfectly embody a pair of lifelong best friends who don't quite know how to handle the crossroads they're at.

Nixon, meanwhile, offers up a character masking her insecurity with sexy confidence. It's no wonder Malachy and Luke are falling over themselves to impress her, but at the same time the actress shows glimpses of a girl who isn't as in control as she'd like to think.

1120,Chicken Run,"Unlike anything ever seen on the big screen, ""Chicken Run"" is the year's biggest original comedy, hailed by critics and audiences alike as ""magical entertainment for all ages!"" (Roger Ebert, Roger Ebert & The Movies) While the chickens on evil Mrs. Tweedy's farm dream of a better life, a clever hen named Ginger is hatching plans to fly the coop- for good! The only problem is, chicken can't fly...or can they? Every escape attempt goes fowl until Rocky, a smooth-talking All-American rooster, crash-lands into the coop. It's hardly poultry in motion when Rocky attempts to teach Ginger and her fine feather friends to fly...but, with teamwork, determination and a little bit o'cluck, the fearless flock plots one last daring attempt in a spectacular bid for freedom! Featuring unforgettable characters, incredible animation, and all-star voice talent, this instant classic from the Academy Award winning creators of Wallace & Gromit is eggs-traordinary fun for the whole family!","The Tweedys are a middle-aged couple who run their chicken farm somewhere in Yorkshire, England. Mrs. Tweedy serves as the genius, while Mr. Tweedy is rather slow, but handles his manual work industriously. The coop is run in the style of a World War II POW camp, with the chickens accountable for the number of eggs they lay daily. One chicken, Ginger, who is often treated as the chickens' leader, has attempted numerous plans to flee the coop, aided by contraband smuggled in by two rats, Nick and Fetcher. However, Ginger is routinely captured by Mr. Tweedy and his dogs and later thrown into a coal bin for solitary confinement during the film's opening credits. Ginger is finally released from the coal bin just in time for roll call the next day. Mrs. Tweedy finds on her clipboard that a chicken named Edwina had not laid any eggs that day. With that, Mrs. Tweedy grabs Edwina and takes her to the chop. Mrs. Tweedy beheads Edwina with a hatchet and cooks her for dinner. Ginger becomes increasingly desperate to find a plan of escape which will work, facing problems with Nick and Fetcher, who are tired of being paid with chicken feed and want their own eggs instead.
Meanwhile, Mrs. Tweedy soon realises that the couple's farm is failing and reads a catalogue on an ambiguous method of increasing profits at the couple's farm. Realising something is wrong, Ginger attempts to convince herself and the other chickens to speed up their efforts to escape. However, Ginger soon concludes that the only escape route is to go over the fence, something she and the other chickens cannot do. Later that same night, as Ginger sits outside, she sees a Rhode Island Red cockerel named Rocky, who flies over the fence and accidentally crashes into the coop. The other chickens fawn over Rocky, while Ginger finds the first half of a poster with a picture of Rocky on it and when she explain to the other chickens how Rocky came in, Ginger claims that Rocky can fly. Upon discovering that Rocky is from a circus, Ginger agrees to hide Rocky from his owners if he teaches them how to fly. Rocky reluctantly agrees, but due to injuring his wing as a result of his landing, he cannot show them immediately. Instead, Rocky puts Ginger and the other chickens through a set of exercises that seem to have no purpose while assuring them that all the chickens are making progress.
Meanwhile, a large pie-making machine arrives, which Mr. Tweedy begins assembling. At the same time, Mrs. Tweedy orders all food rations doubled. Ginger proclaims that their intent is to fatten them up and then kill them, only for Rocky to drag her off. The two of them argue, Rocky claiming that Ginger's honesty will demoralize the chickens, and Ginger refusing to lie to the other hens. Discovering that the chickens have gone into depression following Ginger's announcement, Rocky organises a party by using a radio obtained by Nick and Fetcher, and he and Ginger grow closer whilst dancing. During the party, Rocky's arm is shown to have healed. Once the pie machine is complete, the Tweedys subject Ginger to its first test. Rocky follows Ginger into the machine and eventually rescues her by damaging the machine and giving him and Ginger more time to work on their escape. Fowler, an older cockerel who has been doubting of Rocky's acts, gives Rocky his respect for rescuing Ginger and his old Royal Air Force (RAF) badge in tribute. Rocky decides to flee the farm the next day, leaving behind Fowler's medal and the second half of his poster, showing that he was actually a stunt cockerel, only the word ""flying"" by being shot out of a cannon. This revelation outrages the other chickens and a fight soon breaks out as morale falls. When Fowler arrives to try and restore order, he begins talking of his days in the RAF, leading Ginger to realise that she and the other chickens could build their aeroplane made from Fowler's pictures and personal recollections. Supplied by Nick and Fetcher, the chickens race against time to assemble their plane as the Tweedys work to repair their pie machine.
The chickens finally finish their plane just as Mr. Tweedy completes all the repairs of the pie machine and enters the coop to grab all the chickens. However, the chickens launch an open revolt by tying up and gagging Mr. Tweedy and readying their plane. As the chickens are preparing to depart, Mr. Tweedy ends up freeing himself and knocks down the ramp used to get the chickens' plane airborne. Ginger jumps down as Fowler turns the plane around, which knocks Mr. Tweedy unconscious. As Ginger struggles to lift the ramp, Mrs. Tweedy arrives and attempt to kill Ginger with her used hatchet. However, Rocky jumps over the fence aboard his tricycle and hits Mrs. Tweedy in her face, which briefly knocks her senseless. Rocky and Ginger finally grab onto the string of lights caught on the plane's landing gear as the plane departs, but Mrs. Tweedy soon awakens and also grabs the lights, which weighs down the chickens' plane. Ginger heads down the string to cut it, but accidentally loses her own scissors. Realising what is the only way left to cut the lights, Ginger manages to trick Mrs. Tweedy by using the hatchet to sever the string, which causes Mrs. Tweedy to fall, crash into the pie machine, and plugging her into the safety valve. This causes the pie machine to build-up pressure and explode in a mushroom cloud of gravy, destroying the barn, and covering the entire farm with gravy, leaving only just the barn door standing. The chickens continue to fly to freedom as Mr. Tweedy reminds Mrs. Tweedy: ""I told you they was organised"". Mr. Tweedy later pushes the door on top of Mrs. Tweedy before she can lash on him.
In the epilogue, the chickens find their idyllic setting in a bird sanctuary, where they can live in comfort and raise their new chicks. Having fallen in love with each other, Rocky and Ginger become a couple. Meanwhile, Nick and Fetcher discuss their plans of starting their own chicken farm, so they can have all the eggs they could eat. However, Nick and Fetcher ends up arguing with each other over whether the chicken or the egg came first.","exciting,joy,trust,witty,humorous,coward,fake",1120.jpg,2000-06-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/chicken-run/id319786484?uo=4,jVdlxwX6A7g,60001287,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Chicken_Run/60001287,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Comedy,Drama,Kids & Family"
2806,Children Underground,"Edet Belzberg's Academy Award nominated directorial debut, CHILDREN UNDERGROUND, follows a group of homeless children living in a train station in Bucharest, Romania. Raw and insightful, CHILDREN UNDERGROUND personalizes the often dangerous and always chaotic and uncertain world of youngsters casually abandoned by their families and society at large. It also subtlety illustrates the legacy of former Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. CHILDREN UNDERGROUND won the Sundance Film Festival's Jury Prize, the International Documentary Association's Documentary Award, and the Gotham Awards' Documentary Achievement Prize.","In an effort to increase the Romania's work force, former communist leader Nicolae Ceau‚âà√ºescu outlawed contraception and abortion in 1966. Thousands of unwanted children were placed in state orphanages where they faced terrible conditions. With the fall of Communism, many children moved onto the streets. Some were from the orphanages. Others were runways from impoverished families. Today there are 20,000 children living on the streets while the resources for sheltering these homeless youths are severely limited.
Children Underground follows the story of five street children, aged eight to sixteen who live in a subway station in Bucharest, Romania. The street kids are encountered daily by commuting adults, who pass them by in the station as they starve, swindle, and steal, all while searching desperately for a fresh can of paint to get high with.
Belzberg and her cameraman, Wolfgang Held, maintain their distance as the kids panhandle, fight and sleep on cardboard boxes, either on the train platforms or the public parks above ground, watching dispassionately as the youngsters inhale Aurolac, a noxious silver paint with intoxicating fumes, from plastic bags. In a slightly uplifting coda, Belzberg and crew return a year later to find that a police sweep of the Victoriei has dispersed the children; some landed in state-funded homes, while others simply moved on to one of the many abandoned construction sites that dot the city, ironic symbols of a shining future that never arrived. Belzberg steers away from any discussion of the rampant sexual exploitation of these young children, or the fact that one of the biggest dangers they face are STDs, including AIDS, but the urban hell she presents is shattering enough. Homelessness is all too familiar to many inhabitants of the world's wealthiest cities, but rarely has the situation seemed so hopeless, or its victims so desperate
One of the children director Belzberg follows is Cristina Ionescu. At first this child may seem to be a young man, but you later find out that girls have to become hard and boyish in order to survive. This is also very apparent with another child named, Violeta 'Macarena' Rosu, who is also a girl. The nickname 'Macarena' derives from the song ""Macarena"", her favorite. Three other children, Mihai Tudose, and brother and sister Ana and Marian, are also profiled.
The film explores the lives of these children, who are shown fighting, abusing themselves, and becoming addicted to inhaling a colorant used in chroming called Aurolac. The filmmakers follow Mihai to his family's home in the town of Constan¬ª√µa. A similar scene films Ana and Marian as they visit their home, which is also outside Bucharest.","thought provoking,bleak,disturbing,emotional,sincere,touching",2806.jpg,2001-09-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/children-underground/id529569865?uo=4,,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"
405,Children of a Lesser God,"One of the most critically-acclaimed films of the 80s, Children of a Lesser God garnered four Academy Award nominations and a Best Actress Oscar for Marlee Matlin. Based on the hit Broadway play, it's the uplifting love story of John Leeds (William Hurt), an idealistic special education teacher, and a headstrong deaf girl named Sarah (Marlee Matlin). At first, Leeds sees Sarah as a teaching challenge. But soon their teacher/student relationship blossoms into a love so passionate it shatters the barrier of silence that keeps them apart.","Sarah Norman (Marlee Matlin) is a troubled young deaf woman working as a cleaner at a school for the deaf and hard of hearing in New England. An energetic new teacher, James Leeds (William Hurt), arrives at the school and encourages her to set aside her insular life by learning how to speak aloud.
As she already uses sign language, Sarah resists James's attempts to get her to talk. Romantic interest develops between James and Sarah and they are soon living together, though their differences and mutual stubbornness eventually strains their relationship to the breaking point, as he continues to want her to talk, and she feels somewhat stifled in his presence.
Sarah leaves James and goes to live with her estranged mother (Piper Laurie) in a nearby city, reconciling with her in the process. However, she and James later find a way to resolve their differences.","love,sincere,uplifting,touching,trust,contemplative,feel good,deaf,captivating",405.jpg,1986-10-03, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/children-of-a-lesser-god/id292070334?uo=4,ox4OyhhZkzE,60003584,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Children_of_a_Lesser_God/60003584,"Drama,Musical & Performing Arts,Romance"

3683,Chinatown,"Landmark movie in the film noir tradition, Roman Polanski's Chinatown stands as a true screen classic. Jack Nicholson is private eye Jake Gittes, living off the murky moral climate of sunbaked, pre-war Southern California. Hired by a beautiful socialite (Faye Dunaway) to investigate her husband's extra-marital affair, Gittes is swept into a maelstrom of double dealings and deadly deceits, uncovering a web of personal and political scandals that come crashing together for one, unforgettable night in...Chinatown. Co-starring film legend John Huston and featuring an Academy Award-winning script by Robert Towne, Chinatown captures a lost era in a masterfully woven movie that remains a timeless gem.","Evelyn Mulwray (Ladd) hires private investigator J.J. ""Jake"" Gittes (Nicholson) to perform matrimonial surveillance on her husband Hollis I. Mulwray (Zwerling), the chief engineer for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Gittes tails him, hears him publicly oppose the creation of a new reservoir, and shoots photographs of him with a young woman (Palmer) that hit the front page of the following day's paper. Upon his return to his office he is confronted by a beautiful woman who, after establishing that the two of them have never met, irately informs him that she is in fact Evelyn Mulwray (Dunaway) and he can expect a lawsuit.
Realizing he was set up, Gittes figures whoever did it wants to get Mulwray, but, before he can question the husband, Lt. Lou Escobar (Lopez) fishes his drowned body from a fresh water reservoir. Suspicious of murder, Gittes investigates, and notices that, although huge quantities of water are released from the reservoir every night, the land is almost completely dry. He is confronted by Water Department Security Chief Claude Mulvihill (Jenson) with a henchman (Polanski) who slashes Gittes's nose. Back at his office, Gittes receives a call from Ida Sessions, an actress whom he recognizes as the bogus Mrs. Mulwray. She is afraid to identify her employer, but provides a clue: the name of one of ""those people"" is in that day's obituaries.
Gittes learns that Mrs. Mulwray's husband was once the business partner of her father, Noah Cross (Huston), so he meets him for lunch at his palatial estate. Cross offers to double Gittes's fee to search for Mulwray's missing girlfriend, plus a bonus if he succeeds. Gittes visits the hall of records, where he discovers that many large orange groves have recently changed ownership in the northwest San Fernando Valley. He goes there but is caught and beaten by angry landowners, who think he's one of the water department agents who have been demolishing their water tanks and poisoning their wells to force them out.
Gittes's review of the obituaries uncovers a former resident of the Mar Vista Inn, a retirement home, who is one of the new landowners in the Valley. He infers that Mulwray was murdered when he learned that the new reservoir would be used to irrigate the newly-purchased properties. Evelyn and Gittes bluff their way into Mar Vista and confirm that the real estate deals are done in the name of its residents without their knowledge. After fleeing from Mulvihill and his thugs, they hide at Evelyn's house, where they nurse each other's wounds and make love.
In the morning, Evelyn has to leave suddenly, but she warns him that her father is dangerous and crazy. Gittes manages to follow her car to a house where he observes her with Mulwray's girlfriend. He confronts Evelyn, who finally confesses that the woman is her sister.
An anonymous call draws Gittes to Ida Sessions's apartment where he finds her murdered, with Escobar waiting for his arrival. Escobar pressures him because the coroner's report found salt water in Mulwray's lungs, indicating that the body was moved after death. Escobar suspects Evelyn of the murder, and he insists Gittes produce her quickly or he'll face charges of his own.
Gittes returns to Evelyn's mansion, where he discovers a pair of men's eyeglasses in her salt water garden pond and her servants packing her bags. He summons Cross to the Mulwray home to collect his bonus. Convinced that she killed her husband, Gittes confronts Evelyn about the woman she said was her sister; Evelyn claims it is her daughter Katherine. Gittes slaps her repeatedly until she cries out ""She's my sister and my daughter!"" and haltingly admits to a sexual relationship with her father that began after her mother died. He won't face up to it and for that she hates him. Also, the eyeglasses are not her husband's, she says, since he did not wear bifocals.
Gittes makes plans for the two women to flee to Mexico. He instructs Evelyn to meet him at her butler's home in Chinatown, but Cross intercepts him at Mulwray's. Cross admits he intends to incorporate the Northwest Valley into the City of Los Angeles, then irrigate and develop it. Gittes produces the bifocals -- they belong to Cross and link him to Mulwray's murder. Mulvihill appears to confiscate the glasses and force Jake to take them to the women.
When the three reach the hiding place in Chinatown, the police are already there and arrest Gittes. Evelyn will not allow Cross to approach Katherine, and when he is undeterred she shoots him in the arm and drives away with Katherine. As the car speeds off, the police open fire, killing Evelyn. Cross clutches Katherine and leads her away, while Escobar orders Gittes released, along with his associates. One of them urges, ""Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown.""","scary,more...,cynical,tense,mind bending,captivating,less...,bleak,suspenseful,contemplative,clever,atmospheric,gloomy",3683.jpg,1974-06-20, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/chinatown/id208600546?uo=4,3aifeXlnoqY,374030,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Chinatown/374030,"Classics,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

When harmless pranks give way to more dangerous escapades, their lives spin recklessly out of control, leading to an explosive, high-flying climax that will leave you breathless!","Seattle teenager Andrew Detmer (Dane DeHaan) starts videotaping his life. His mother Karen (Bo Petersen) is slowly dying from cancer and his alcoholic father Richard (Michael Kelly) verbally and physically abuses him. At school, Andrew is unpopular and frequently bullied.
Andrew's cousin Matt (Alex Russell) invites him to a party to help him meet people, but Andrew's filming angers an attendee and Andrew leaves despondent. Andrew is persuaded by popular student Steve (Michael B. Jordan) to record something strange he and Matt have found in the woods: a hole in the ground emitting a loud strange noise. The three enter the hole and discover a large glowing blue crystalline object. The object glows red and the group is stricken by nosebleeds and pain. The camera cuts out. Weeks later Andrew records himself, Matt, and Steve as they display telekinetic abilities, able to move objects with their minds, but bleeding from their noses when they overexert themselves. They return to the hole, but find that it has collapsed and that the sheriff's department is sealing off the area.
As their abilities grow more powerful, Matt theorizes that they function like a muscle, becoming stronger with use. The trio develop a close friendship and begin employing their abilities to play pranks. However, after Andrew pushes a rude motorist off the road and into a river, Matt insists that they restrict the use of their powers, particularly against living creatures.
When they discover the ability to fly, they agree to fly around the world together after graduation. Andrew wants to visit Tibet for the peaceful nature. Steve encourages Andrew to enter the school talent show to gain popularity. Andrew amazes his fellow students by disguising his powers as impressive feats. That night, Andrew, Matt and Steve celebrate at a house party, where Andrew is the center of attention. After drinking with his classmate Monica (Anna Wood), she and Andrew go upstairs to have sex, but Andrew vomits on Monica, humiliating himself.
Andrew becomes increasingly withdrawn and hostile, culminating when his father Richard attacks him, and Andrew uses his power to overcome him. His outburst is so extreme that it inflicts psychically connected nosebleeds and pain on Steve and Matt. Steve is drawn to Andrew, who is floating in the middle of a storm. Steve tries to console him, but Andrew grows increasingly angry until Steve is suddenly struck by lightning and killed. At Steve's funeral, Matt confronts Andrew about the suspicious circumstances of Steve's death. Andrew denies responsibility to Matt, but he privately begs forgiveness at Steve's grave.
Andrew grows distant from Matt and again finds himself ostracized at school. After being bullied, he psychically tears the wisdom teeth from the bully's mouth. Andrew begins to identify himself as an apex predator, rationalizing that he should not feel guilt for using his power to hurt those weaker than himself. When his mother's condition deteriorates, Andrew uses his powers to steal money for her medicine. After mugging some local thugs, he robs a gas station where he inadvertently causes an explosion that puts him in the hospital with severe burns and under police investigation. At his bedside, his father informs the unconscious Andrew that his mother has died, and he angrily blames Andrew for her death. As his father is about to strike him, Andrew awakens and the outer wall of his hospital room explodes.
Elsewhere Matt experiences a nosebleed and senses Andrew is in trouble. He sees a news report about the hospital explosion and travels there, finding Andrew floating outside the building. Andrew drops his father, who is saved by Matt, and proceeds to wreak havoc with his powers. Matt confronts Andrew at the Space Needle and tries to reason with him, but Andrew grows hostile and irrational at any attempt to control him. Andrew attacks Matt and the pair fight across the city, crashing through buildings and hurling vehicles. Injured and enraged, Andrew uses his power to destroy the buildings around him, threatening hundreds of lives. Unable to get through to Andrew and left with no other choice, Matt tears a spear from a nearby statue, and impales Andrew with it, killing him. The police surround Matt, but he flies away.
Three months later, Matt lands in Tibet with Andrew‚Äö√Ñ√¥s camera. Speaking to the camera while addressing Andrew, Matt vows to use his powers for good and to find out what happened to them in the hole. Matt positions the camera to view a Tibetan monastery in the distance and says ""You made it"" before flying away, leaving the camera behind to continue recording the tranquil scene.","control,belief,super powers,super,for the greater good,friends,suspenseful,loss of control,anger,friendship,teenagers,wonder,dark side,alien,surprise,responsibility,fear",2876.jpg,2012-02-03, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/chronicle/id505098635?uo=4,nGcwSDNFcsU,70212503,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Chronicle/70212503,"Art House & International,Drama,Horror,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
3048,Cinderella Man,"During the Great Depression, a common-man hero, James J. Braddock--a.k.a. the Cinderella Man--was to become one of the most surprising sports legends in history. By the early 1930s, the impoverished ex-prizefighter was seemingly as broken-down, beaten-up and out-of-luck as much of the rest of the American populace who had hit rock bottom. His career appeared to be finished, he was unable to pay the bills, the only thing that mattered to him--his family--was in danger, and he was even forced to go on Public Relief. But deep inside, Jim Braddock never relinquished his determination. Driven by love, honor and an incredible dose of grit, he willed an impossible dream to come true. In a last-chance bid to help his family, Braddock returned to the ring. No one thought he had a shot. However Braddock, fueled by something beyond mere competition, kept winning. Suddenly, the ordinary working man became the mythic athlete. Carrying the hopes and dreams of the disenfranchised on his shoulders, Braddock rocketed through the ranks, until this underdog chose to do the unthinkable: take on the heavyweight champ of the world, the unstoppable Max Baer, renowned for having killed two men in the ring.","James J. Braddock is an Irish-American boxer from New Jersey, formerly a light heavyweight contender, who is forced to give up boxing after breaking his hand in the ring. This is both a relief and an upset to his wife, Mae: she cannot bring herself to watch the violence of his chosen profession, yet she knows they will have no good income without his boxing.
As the United States enters the Great Depression, Braddock does manual labor as a longshoreman to support his family, even after badly breaking his hand. Unfortunately, he cannot get work every day. Thanks to a last-minute cancellation by another boxer, Braddock's longtime manager and friend, Joe Gould, offers him a chance to fill in for just this one night and make a little money. The fight is against the number-two contender in the world, Corn Griffin.
Braddock stuns the boxing experts and fans with a third-round knockout of his formidable opponent. He believes that while his right hand was broken, he became more proficient with his left hand, improving his in-ring ability. Against his wife's wishes, Braddock takes up Gould's offer to return to the ring. Mae resents this attempt by Gould to profit from her husband's dangerous livelihood, until she discovers that Gould and his wife also have been devastated by hard times.
With a shot at the heavyweight championship held by Max Baer a possibility, Braddock continues to win. Out of a sense of pride, he uses a portion of his prize money to pay back money to the government given to him while unemployed. When his rags to riches story gets out, the sportswriter Damon Runyon dubs him ""The Cinderella Man"", and before long Braddock comes to represent the hopes and aspirations of the American public struggling with the Depression.
A title fight against Baer comes his way. Braddock is a 10-to-1 underdog. Mae is terrified because Baer, the champ, is a vicious man who reportedly has killed at least two men in the ring. He is so destructive that the fight's promoter, James Johnston, forces both Braddock and Gould to watch a film of Baer in action, just so he can maintain later that he warned them what Braddock was up against.
Braddock demonstrates no fear. The arrogant Baer attempts to intimidate him, even taunting Mae in public that her man might not survive. When he says this, she becomes so angry that she throws a drink at him. She cannot bring herself to attend the fight at the Madison Square Garden Bowl or even to listen to it on the radio.
On June 13, 1935, in one of the biggest achievements in boxing history, Braddock defeats the seemingly invincible Baer to become the heavyweight champion of the world.
A graphic at the end of the film reveals that Braddock worked on the building of the Verrazano Bridge, and that he later owned and operated heavy machinery on the docks where he worked during the Depression. Also, he and Mae used the winnings to buy a house, in which they spent the rest of their lives.","sentimental,emotional,sincere,anticipation,uplifting,touching",3048.jpg,2005-05-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cinderella-man/id292303517?uo=4,DlbHzcH4VJY,70021639,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cinderella_Man/70021639,"Action & Adventure,Drama"
2152,Cinema Verite,"Decades before we had reality television, there was the Loud family. From HBO Films comes the story of the groundbreaking PBS documentary 'An American Family' which chronicled the lives of the Loud family in the early 1970s. The cameras put the Louds in the national spotlight as parents Pat and Bill (Diane Lane, Tim Robbins) grappled with their marriage while raising their children. Filmmaker Craig Gilbert (James Gandolfini) felt the family's struggles were relatable to many Americans, but none of them could have predicted that the series would catapult them to notoriety and give birth to reality TV.","The film begins in 1971 with Craig Gilbert (James Gandolfini) discussing with Pat Loud (Diane Lane) the idea of a documentary series that would concern her family's day to day lives. Pat considers the proposal and accepts, amidst her son Lance (Thomas Dekker) moving to New York City. Pat's husband Bill (Tim Robbins) travels often away on business, leaving his wife alone to care for their five children.
The crew (Patrick Fugit, Shanna Collins) moves in with the Louds and begins to document them. Relations between Pat and Bill grow frayed due to his time away and the stress of the TV show's production. Gilbert tells Pat of his suspicions surrounding Bill's trips away, giving fairly strong evidence that he is cheating on her. The crew fights with Gilbert about his documentary technique, as he makes them film many personal moments.
After surreptitiously duplicating the keys to Bill's office, Pat makes a late night trip to the office and discovers documents that confirm he is cheating on Pat with two other women, resulting in Pat's preparations to file for a divorce. Angry, she tells Gilbert to have cameras there when she tells Bill, wanting ""his bimbos to see it, the whole world to see it."" Against her wishes, he films Pat's conversation with her brother and his wife.
Pat begins to regret her decision to let Gilbert film the break up, and tries to get one of her sons to tell him while driving Bill home instead. He, however, does not work up the courage to do this, and Pat kicks Bill out of her home on camera.
The film cuts to one year later, when An American Family is experiencing its premiere. The show airs to strong television ratings but much criticism of members of the family, in particular Pat for how she came off on camera and Lance for his homosexuality. The family then gets together to ""fight back"", addressing their critics by appearing on many talk shows.
Title cards at film's end offer updates for each Loud family member. Lance died of AIDS in 2001, his last wish for his parents to move back in with each other. They currently live together in Los Angeles.","thought provoking,sentimental,emotional,sincere,captivating,contemplative",2152.jpg,2011-04-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cinema-verite/id504918326?uo=4,Sc9Tfjxf53M,70184890,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cinema_Verite/70184890,"Drama,Television"

2702,Citizen Kane,"Orson Welles' masterwork (#1 in the American Film Institute's list of Best American Movies) dazzles anew in a superb 70th-anniversary digital transfer. It's grand entertainment, sharply acted (starting many of Welles' Mercury Players on the road to thriving film careers) and directed with inspired visual flair. Chronicling the stormy life of an influential publishing tycoon, this Best Original Screenplay Academy Award winner (1941) is rooted in themes of power, corruption, vanity - the American Dream lost in the mystery of a dying man's last word: ""Rosebud.""","Charles Foster Kane (Orson Welles), an enormously wealthy media proprietor, has been living alone in Florida in his vast palatial estate Xanadu for the last years of his life, with a ""No trespassing"" sign on the gate. He dies in a bed while holding a snow globe and utters ""Rosebud...""; the globe slips from his dying hand and smashes. Kane's death then becomes sensational news around the world. Newsreel reporter Jerry Thompson (William Alland) tries to find out about Kane's private life and, in particular, to discover the meaning behind his last word. The reporter interviews the great man's friends and associates, and Kane's story unfolds as a series of flashbacks. Thompson approaches Kane's second wife, Susan Alexander (Dorothy Comingore), now an alcoholic who runs her own club, but she refuses to tell him anything. Thompson then goes to the private archive of the late Walter Parks Thatcher (George Coulouris), a banker who served as Kane's guardian during his childhood and adolescence. It is through Thatcher's written memoirs that Thompson learns about Kane's childhood. Thompson then interviews Kane's personal business manager Mr. Bernstein (Everett Sloane), best friend Jedediah Leland (Joseph Cotten), Susan for a second time, and Kane's butler Raymond (Paul Stewart) at Xanadu.
Flashbacks reveal that Kane's childhood was spent in poverty in Colorado (his parents ran a boarding house), until the ""world's third largest gold mine"" was discovered on the seemingly worthless property his mother had acquired. He is forced to leave his mother (Agnes Moorehead) when she sends him away to the East Coast of the U.S. to live with Thatcher, to be educated. After gaining full control over his possessions at the age of 25, Kane enters the newspaper business with sensationalized yellow journalism. He takes control of the newspaper, the New York Inquirer, and hires all the best journalists. His attempted rise to power is documented, including his manipulation of public opinion for the Spanish American War; his first marriage to Emily Monroe Norton (Ruth Warrick), a President's niece; and his campaign for the office of governor of New York State, for which alternative newspaper headlines are created depending on the result.
Kane's marriage disintegrates over the years, and he begins an affair with Susan Alexander. Both his wife and his opponent discover the affair, simultaneously ending his marriage and his political career. Kane marries his mistress, and forces her into an operatic career for which she has neither talent nor ambition. Kane finally allows her to abandon her singing career after she attempts suicide, but after a span of time spent in boredom and isolation in Xanadu, she ultimately leaves him.
Kane spends his last years building his vast estate and lives alone, interacting only with his staff. The butler recounts that Kane had said ""Rosebud"" after Susan left him, right after seeing a snow globe.
At Xanadu, Kane's vast number of belongings are being catalogued, ranging from priceless works of art to worthless furniture. During this time, Thompson finds that he is unable to solve the mystery and concludes that ""Rosebud"" will forever remain an enigma. He theorizes that ""Mr. Kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. Maybe Rosebud was something he couldn't get, or something he lost."" In the ending of the film, it is revealed to the audience that Rosebud was the name of the sled from Kane's childhood ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ an allusion to the only time in his life when he was truly happy. The sled, thought to be junk, is burned and destroyed in a basement furnace by Xanadu's departing staff.","emotional,tense,contemplative,clever,atmospheric,captivating,gloomy",2702.jpg,1941-05-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/citizen-kane-70th-anniversary/id447852615?uo=4,zyv19bg0scg,60000605,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Citizen_Kane/60000605,"Classics,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

They decide the best birthday gift is to go on a two week holiday in the wild west driving cattle from New Mexico to Colorado. There they meet cowboy Curly who not only teaches them how to become real cowboys, but also one or two other things about life in the open air of the west.","New Yorker Mitch Robbins (Billy Crystal) has just turned 39 years old, and is thick in the middle of a midlife crisis. His best friends are also having crises of their own.
Phil Berquist (Daniel Stern) is stuck managing his father-in-law's grocery store, while trapped in a sexless marriage with his overbearing wife, Arlene.
Ed Furillo (Bruno Kirby) is a successful businessman and playboy, having recently married an underwear model, but is struggling with the idea of monogamous marriage and the pressure to have kids. Ed often invites his two best friends on his various adventures, which are not always appreciated by Mitch, as one year earlier he suffered a mortifying injury during a holiday in Pamplona, Spain during the running of the bulls.
At Mitch's birthday party, Phil and Ed present their joint gift: a two-week Southwestern cattle drive for all three men. Mitch initially refuses, having promised to visit his wife Barbara's (Patricia Wettig) parents in Florida. However, they are also visited by a young check-out girl Nancy (Yeardley Smith) from Phil's grocery store who inadvertently reveals an affair they recently had. Heartbroken, Arlene informs her father and files for divorce, and Phil loses his job. After Barbara insists he go, Mitch and friends travel to New Mexico, where they meet ranch owner Clay Stone (Noble Willingham) and several other participants of the cattle drive.
As they ""learn the ropes"" of moving a herd, the trio enter a tense encounter with the ranch's two professional cowboys, Jeff and T.R. (Kyle Secor and Dean Hallo), when they drunkenly proposition another participant, Bonnie Rayburn (Helen Slater). The standoff is abruptly halted when Curly Washburn (Jack Palance), the seasoned, tough-as-nails trail boss, lassos Jeff into a chokehold, and chastises both for being intoxicated on the job. He demands Jeff apologize to Bonnie. Bonnie develops a crush on Mitch after this, but Mitch does not reciprocate.
Curly, Jeff, T.R., and the ranch's guests begin the long drive to Colorado. Curly overhears Mitch insult him and later humiliates Mitch in retaliation. After a destructive stampede is Mitch's fault, as punishment Curly chooses a fearful Mitch to ride with him in the canyons to find some stray cows. They spend the night alone and slowly begin to bond. Mitch discovers that despite Curly's tough exterior, he is a very wise man. Curly advises him how to face his problems: by concentrating on the ""one thing"" that is most important in his life.
The next morning, Curly and Mitch are forced to deliver a pregnant cow's calf, which Mitch names ""Norman"". After Curly is forced to euthanize its ailing mother by delivering a coup de grace, Mitch informally adopts the newborn.
The drive runs into trouble when Curly unexpectedly suffers a fatal heart attack. As they proceed without him, Cookie the cook (Tracey Walter) gets drunk and breaks both his legs, requiring him to be taken to a hospital. Without Curly's presence, Jeff and T.R. become freely intoxicated, goading Mitch into challenging them. Ed intervenes and Phil soon disarms both, furiously ordering them to go to bed.
Fearing reprisals from Clay Stone, Jeff and T.R. abandon the group in the wilderness, leaving them with no trail boss, food or map. The remaining participants decide to abandon the herd and seek civilization, except for Ed and Phil, who insist on driving the herd to Colorado despite Mitch's pleas. The others ride on ahead, but Mitch unexpectedly returns (wearing Curly's black hat) to rejoin his fellow ""city slickers"" and finish the drive.
The final test of the drive involves crossing a dangerous river. Despite a violent storm, the men successfully drive most of the herd across the river, except for Norman, who is caught up in the river's rapid current. Mitch impulsively chases after him, successfully lassoing the calf, but in turn gets caught in the rapids; seeing this, Phil and Ed race down the bank themselves and, working together, are able to save Mitch and Norman.
As the men collapse on the river bank, they all have a long laugh, having at last overcome their respective crises. From there the three easily lead the herd back to the Colorado ranch, where they are warmly received by the other participants. Clay Stone, overwhelmed, rewards the entire group, and the trio in particular, for overcoming such adversity by fully refunding their fees. To their dismay, however, Stone has decided to sell the cows to a meat company for a fine price.
Mitch returns to New York a happier man, having realized that his ""one thing"" is his family. Ed returns home to tell his newlywed wife he is fine with having children, and Phil starts a new relationship with Bonnie. Mitch has spared Norman from the slaughter by purchasing him and bringing the calf home as a pet, at least until he can find a ""nice petting zoo"".","touching,contemplative,humorous,stylized,feel good,bittersweet,captivating",1152.jpg,1991-06-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/city-slickers/id298409263?uo=4,AquxFeEoDgM,,,"Comedy,Western"

The box is entrusted the mayor of the underground complex. Each mayor, in turn, passes the box onto his or her successor. When the box has 47 more years left on the time-lock, the mayor holding the box dies suddenly. The significance of the box had not been explained to anyone else, and the mayor's family places it in a junk-filled closet. When 200 years have passed, the time-lock clicks the box open, but the event goes unnoticed.
For generations, the people of Ember have lived in a huge underground complex built as a refuge for humanity. It is built into a vast cavern so high that it is filled with regular-sized buildings. Far above the tops of the buildings are banks of floodlights that light the city during the day and provide light for the greenhouses. The lights are powered by a massive generator. Now it is year 247 and Ember threatens to fall into darkness as the generator begins to fail. Blackouts are occurring with increasing frequency and last longer each time. The reserves of canned goods and light bulbs are becoming depleted. Much of the knowledge about how to utilize and repair the systems necessary for the city's survival has also slowly been lost over succeeding generations.
At a rite of passage for all graduating students called Assignment Day, the mayor (Bill Murray) stands before the graduating students as they choose, by lottery, what their occupations will be. Lina (Saoirse Ronan), a young girl dreaming to be a messenger, is assigned to be a ""Pipeworks Laborer"" and Doon (Harry Treadaway) is assigned ""Messenger"". The two swap occupations even though it is not allowed. Lina goes home to find her grandmother searching for something in the closet, which turns out to be the lost metal box. Unable to piece the torn papers inside the box together, Lina nevertheless resolves to decipher their meaning and enlists Doon's help. As blackouts become more frequent, Lina and Doon realize that the information inside the box could lead to the salvation of Ember. Racing against time, the two follow the clues, and eventually come into conflict with the mayor and other corrupt politicians.
During their flight, it turns out that their parents had once joined in an attempt to make their way beyond Ember - an attempt which ended when Lina's father drowned after their tunneler hit an underground river. The pair realizes the document is a set of instructions on how to escape the city, and they search for the hidden exit. They also discover that the mayor has been hoarding canned food in a secret room. When they report the theft, they are declared traitors. Now on the run from the mayor's police, the pair puts their escape plan into action. They fetch Poppy, Lina's younger sister, and follow the instructions, which leads them to the surface where they see and feel the natural air and sky for the first time. At first, they despair, because it is dark and they assume that they haven't escaped, but they do not realize it is nighttime. In the morning, as the sun rises, they gaze in amazement at the glowing sun and blue sky. They then tie a message of their discovery to a rock and drop it back down to the city, where it is found by Doon's father (Tim Robbins).","exciting,trust",3286.jpg,2008-09-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/city-of-ember/id299413486?uo=4,FOC8PdK9gSA,,,"Action & Adventure,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

Because Mormons are counseled by their religion‚Äö√Ñ√¥s leaders to avoid R-rated films, dozens of businesses in Utah were able to create a niche in the DVD market by stripping Hollywood films of sex, violence, and profanity and then selling and renting clean versions of these films at retail stores not only in Utah, but throughout North America. When news of film sanitizing reached the likes of Steven Spielberg, Steven Soderbergh, Robert Redford, and Martin Scorsese, they and other members of the Director‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Guild of America responded with outrage over what they saw as the desecration of their art and a violation of held copyright. In 2006, a US District Court judge ruled in accordance with the DGA‚Äö√Ñ√¥s arguments, ordering the retailers of cleaned-up films to close their doors. However, dozens of sanitized-movie retailers defied the judgment and remained open well into 2007 and beyond, supported by their largely Mormon customer base, who saw the Hollywood filmmakers behind the suit as self-important and morally bankrupt. During the time these stores were operating illegally, James and Ligairi had unprecedented access to dozens of renegade stores and their Mormon owners, including the infamous Daniel Thompson. 

CLEANFLIX follows this publicly open but privately conflicted man through the legal and moral battles he would face, while offering a revealing look behind the scenes of the sanitized movie industry and the Mormon culture that created it.
","When a small Utah-based edited movie company is caught sanitizing Hollywood's copyrighted material, the film industry strikes back with a devastating blow.

Dozens of Utah DVD retailers attracted unwanted attention from Hollywood heavyweights when, in the name of conservative family values, they began sanitizing films of sex, nudity, profanity, and violence. Outraged over the unauthorized editing of their work, prominent filmmakers began to speak out, thrusting the two groups into an intense legal, theoretical, and moral battle that would last six years before coming to a shocking conclusion.

2955,Clerks II,"Ten years ago best friends Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) and Randal Graves (Jeff Anderson) were New Jersey mini-mall clerks still slacking off together in their early 20s. Now, Kevin Smith checks back in to see what kind of changes have rocked their lives -- in work, romance and their eternally raucous life philosophy. What he discovers is that never before have so many still done so little while having so much fun doing it. Now working in the fast-food universe, Dante and Randal have managed to maintain, and even hone, their in-your-face attitudes, agile skill with vulgarities and unbridled love of screwing with the customers. But they‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢re also faced with such shocking new prospects as marriage, leaving Jersey and finding real careers. Smith (""Clerks,"" ""Chasing Amy,"" ""Dogma,"" ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"") pushes his nothing-is-sacred humor right to the edge and then takes a leap as Dante and Randal invade the world of Mooby's fast food restaurant, where the slogan is ""I'm Eating It."" Behind the counter, where the only other employees are an uber-nerd (Trevor Ferhman) and an entirely too sexy manager (Rosario Dawson), Dante and Randal are free to offend anybody and everybody who so much as orders fries in their inimitably irreverent way. But, even as riotous debates rage between them over such burning matters as George Lucas v. Peter Jackson v. Jesus, change is on the horizon. When Dante announces that he's going to leave Jersey forever and marry Emma Bunting (Jennifer Schwalbach), Randal plots a going-away party so shocking it will draw the police, the fire department and potential protests from PETA, while altering their lives forever.","Retail clerk Dante Hicks (Brian O'Halloran) opens the Quick Stop convenience store to find that it is on fire; Randal (Jeff Anderson) had left the coffee pot on after closing the night before. As a result of the Quick Stop's destruction, Dante and Randal begin working at a Mooby's fast food restaurant. A year later, Dante is planning to leave his minimum wage lifestyle in favor of a family life in Florida with his fianc‚àö¬©e Emma Bunting (Jennifer Schwalbach), whose father will provide them with a home and a business to run. This leaves Randal bitterly disappointed, who fears that with Dante moving to Florida would leave him without his best friend. Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith) have since followed Dante and Randal, and now loiter outside of Mooby's. Jay and Silent Bob no longer do drugs after they were arrested for the possession of drugs and were sent to rehab, and become devout Christians following their release. However, Jay and Silent Bob continue selling drugs.
Throughout the day, many misadventures occur within Mooby's; among these incidents are arguments between Randal and Dante, as well as arguments between Randal and Elias (Trevor Fehrman), another Mooby's employee, and with a customer (Kevin Weisman) who is a fan of The Lord of the Rings. Other incidents include Randal and Dante unintentionally giving Jay and Silent Bob inedible food, and Randal using a racial slur in front of a couple of black customers, although Randal did not directly insult them nor did he know the term ""porchmonkey"" which he used was actually a racial slur. The word nearly gets Randal fired. Another incident occurs when a former fellow high school student, Lance Dowds (Jason Lee), taunts Dante and Randal for their jobs, prompting Randal to ease his anger through going go-karting with Dante, despite leaving work without asking permission from their boss Becky Scott (Rosario Dawson), leaving her and Elias to deal with customers on their own.
Dante confesses to Becky that he is worried about dancing at his wedding, so she takes him up onto the roof of the restaurant to teach him some moves. Dante soon lets go of his inhibitions and learns how to dance. When the song ends, Dante, caught up in the moment, tells Becky he loves her, and she reveals to him that she is pregnant; Dante and Becky had a one night stand on the prep table a few weeks before. Becky tells Dante not to tell anyone about the baby; however Dante tells Randal, who is shocked and criticizes Dante for cheating on his fiancee. An angered Becky leaves when she learns that Dante told Randal.
Randal encourages Dante to leave Mooby's in search for Becky, and in the meantime, sets up a surprise going away party for Dante. Randal hires ""Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud,"" a donkey show with a fog machine. When Dante comes back, he mistakes the fog for a fire and calls the fire department, but upon discovering that it is not a fire, he proceeds to watch the show with Randal, Jay, Bob, and Elias. The group soon discovers that ""Kinky Kelly"" is, in fact, the donkey, while the guy (Zak Knutson), whom Randal thought to be the pimp, is ""The Sexy Stud"". When Becky returns, Dante tells her that he believes that she feels the same way about him as he does about her. As they kiss, Emma arrives. She throws her engagement ring at Becky and angrily storms off.
The fire and police departments soon arrive and discover the show. Dante, Randal, Elias, Jay, Silent Bob, and The Sexy Stud are detained and jailed. The Sexy Stud tells the others that they will soon be released, and that he will have to pay a fine for his acts. Nevertheless, Dante blames Randal for ruining his life and expresses his eagerness to start a new life without Randal, while Randal condemns Dante for wanting to move to Florida and even goes as far as calling Dante a ""fucking drone"", for Randal's view that Dante wants to live his life under the standards of others. Amid the argument, Randal proposes that they buy the Quick Stop and re-open it, although Dante reacts by saying that neither two have the money to purchase the store. Jay and Silent Bob, who were watching the confrontation between Dante and Randal, offer to lend them some money (from the royalties they collected following the events of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back) on the condition that they can loiter outside of the Quick Stop. Randal accepts their offer, but Dante remains somewhat skeptical, prompting Randal to emotionally confess his fear of losing Dante. As a result, Dante agrees to the proposition as well, and after his release, he proposes to Becky, who accepts. Elias applies for a job and is hired at RST Video, the store adjacent to Quick Stop. In the very last scene, with the store open, Dante says, ""Can you feel it?

1168,Click,"A harried workaholic, Michael Newman (Adam Sandler) doesn't have time for his wife (Kate Beckinsale) and children, not if he's to impress his ungrateful boss and earn a well-deserved promotion. So when he meets Morty (Christopher Walken), a loopy sales clerk, he gets the answer to his prayers: a magical remote that allows him to bypass life's little distractions with increasingly hysterical results. But as Michael gleefully mutes, skips and scans past his family and his friends, the remote gradually takes over his life and begins to program him, in this fast, funny and out-of-control comedy adventure.","Michael Newman (Adam Sandler), an architect, is married to his longtime sweetheart Donna (Kate Beckinsale) with two children, Ben and Samantha. Michael is easily pushed around by his overbearing boss Mr. Ammer (David Hasselhoff). On numerous occasions, Michael willingly sacrifices time with his family to work so he can give them the kinds of possessions he never had.
While going in search of a universal remote control at a Bed Bath & Beyond, Michael falls onto a bed and then proceeds to the section marked ""Beyond."" There, he meets a mysterious clerk named Morty (Christopher Walken), who gives him a ""universal"" remote control and warns that it can never be returned.
To Michael's amazement, he finds that the remote can control the actual universe, particularly time. Michael uses it to skip fights with Donna, go forward until he rids himself of a cold, and skip a family dinner to work. Later, Morty reveals that when Michael fast-forwards through time, his body is on ""auto-pilot"" - his mind skips ahead, while his body does everyday life.
After Mr. Ammer promises Michael a partnership position within a few months, he decides to skip ahead to it, but ends up skipping a year of his life since it took him that long to actually get the promotion. Michael also finds out that he is in marriage counseling and missed the death of his dog. When the remote begins fast-forwarding without Michael controlling it, Morty warns the remote programs itself according to Michael's previous commands. Michael's various attempts to dispose of or destroy the remote fail, so he resolves to change his life so that the remote can't control him. The next day, Mr. Ammer tells Michael he is leaving the country, and in the course of the conversation Mr Ammer suggests one day Michael may end up CEO. Without thinking, Michael responds to say he would like to end up CEO, the remote reacts accordingly and fast-forwards ten years to 2017. Michael is now the CEO, but he is obese, lives alone, his children are teenagers, he is divorced from Donna, and they all hate him. Michael also discovers that Donna is now dating Ben's childhood swim coach, Bill. Michael visits his old house and, after fighting with Donna, the new family dog pounces on him, and he falls and hits his head.
The remote having ""learned"" from Michael having skipped his cold, it transports him six years into the future, as he had not been healthy a single day over those six years: Donna recounts how a precautionary CAT scan after the fall revealed cancer, and how Michael ate so prolifically during chemotherapy as to subsequently suffer from a heart attack. In those six years, Michael is no longer obese thanks to liposuction, Donna has married Bill, and Ben has gone into his father's line of work. Ben tells Michael his father Ted died, and Michael uses the remote to view the last time they spoke. While on auto-pilot, Michael angrily rejected Ted's offer for a night out with him and Ben. During Michael's grief, Morty reveals he is in fact the Angel of Death. Fearing him, Michael begs to go to a ""good place"", and fast forwards several years to Ben's wedding in 2031. There, he witnesses Samantha call Bill ""Dad"", and the shock triggers a second heart attack. When Michael awakens, Morty appears to tell him that he chose his path and there is nothing he can do about it. Michael's family arrives and Ben reveals that he has cancelled his honeymoon in order to work on an important deal that will keep his business going. Shocked and not wanting Ben to make the same mistakes he did, Michael rushes after him. A nurse attempts to stop him but Michael manages to jab the man with a sedative. He ignores Morty's repeated warnings that the machines are all that are keeping him alive. Michael reaches his family and collapses, but manages to convince Ben that family comes first; he reassures the rest that he still loves them, and then Morty comes up to take him.
There is a white flash, and Michael wakes up in the present day on the bed he collapsed onto at the Bed Bath & Beyond, believing that the events have all been ""a dream."" He makes amends with his father, and reassures Donna, Ben, and Samantha of his affection for them and that he will never sacrifice them for work again. As he celebrates being home, Michael finds the remote and a note sitting on his kitchen counter. After reading the note, which states that Morty knew Michael would do the right thing this time, and realizing he actually experienced the events, he throws the remote in the trash and goes to restart his life with his family.","stop,sadness,joy,remote for your life,stanby,remote,rewind,ces,pause,forward,future,on,anticipation,offbeat,mute,control,sentimental,past and present,humorous,past,record,time travel,off,smartphone,surprise",1168.jpg,2006-06-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/click/id277048290?uo=4,448jZuA5Y1I,70041162,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Click/70041162,"Comedy,Kids & Family"
528,Client 9: The Rise and Fall of Eliot Spitzer,"Documentary on the rise of Eliot Spitzer, first as Attorney General and then Governor of New York and his subsequent downfall due to a sex scandal. Spitzer had a hard driving, take no prisoners approach to prosecuting criminals. When he focused his efforts on Wall Street, he came up against some very powerful men. The chink in his armor was an escort whom he met regularly. When the fact that he spent time with a prostitute became public the knives came out so to speak, and Spitzer found himself isolated, resigning the Governorship. At one point, Spitzer recounts the story of a friend who gave him a t-shirt with 'Hubris is Terminal' printed on the front. A fitting epitaph somehow for his political career. ","This documentary feature takes an in-depth look at the rapid rise and dramatic fall of New York Governor Eliot Spitzer. Nicknamed ""The Sheriff of Wall Street,"" when he was NY's Attorney General, Eliot Spitzer prosecuted crimes by America's largest financial institutions and some of the most powerful executives in the country. After his election as Governor, with the largest margin in the state's history, many believed Spitzer was on his way to becoming the nation's first Jewish President. Then, shockingly, Spitzer's meteoric rise turned into a precipitous fall when the New York Times revealed that Spitzer - the paragon of rectitude - had been caught seeing prostitutes. As his powerful enemies gloated, his supporters questioned the timing of it all: as the Sheriff fell, so did the financial markets, in a cataclysm that threatened to unravel the global economy. With unique access to the escort world and well as friends, colleagues and enemies of the ex-Governor (many of whom have come forward for the first time) the film explores the hidden contours of this tale of hubris, sex, and power.-- (C) Magnolia",,528.jpg,2010-11-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/client-9-rise-fall-eliot-spitzer/id395409592?uo=4,,70137776,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Client_9_The_Rise_and_Fall_of_Eliot_Spitzer/70137776,"Documentary,Special Interest"

1073,Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"Planes reported missing in 1945 suddenly appear in the Mojave desert. A commercial flight is buzzed by a 'bright' object that the pilot 'wouldn't know how to describe'. Roy Neary, while working one night, has a Close Encounter... The US Government determine where the visitors plan to land and create an elaborate cover-up to keep people away. However, a group of people, including Neary, share a vision which draws them to the place and a meeting with new, and old, friends.","In the Sonoran Desert, French scientist Claude Lacombe and his American interpreter, mapmaker David Laughlin, along with other government scientific researchers, discover Flight 19, a squadron of Grumman TBF Avengers that went missing more than 30 years earlier. The planes are intact and operational, but there is no sign of the pilots. An old man who witnessed the event claimed ""the sun came out at night, and sang to him."" They also find a lost ship in the Gobi Desert named SS Cotopaxi. At an Air Traffic Control center in Indianapolis, Indiana, a controller listens as two airline flights almost have a mid-air collision with an apparent unidentified flying object (UFO). In Muncie, Indiana, 3-year-old Barry Guiler is awakened in the night when his toys start operating on their own. Fascinated, he gets out of bed and discovers something or someone (off-screen) in the kitchen. He runs outside, forcing his mother, Jillian, to chase after him.
Investigating one of a series of large-scale power outages, Indiana electrical lineman Roy Neary experiences a close encounter with a UFO, when it flies over his truck and lightly burns the side of his face with its bright lights. The UFO, along with three others, are pursued by Neary and three police cars, but the spacecrafts fly off into the night sky. Roy becomes fascinated by UFOs, much to the dismay of his wife, Ronnie. He also becomes increasingly obsessed with subliminal, mental images of a mountain-like shape and begins to make models of it. Jillian also becomes obsessed with sketching a unique-looking mountain. Soon after, she is terrorized in her home by a UFO encounter in which Barry is abducted by unseen beings.
Lacombe and Laughlin‚Äö√Ñ√Æalong with a group of United Nations experts‚Äö√Ñ√Æcontinue to investigate increasing UFO activity and strange, related occurrences. Witnesses report that the UFOs make distinctive sounds: a five-tone musical phrase in a major scale. Scientists broadcast the phrase to outer space, but are mystified by the response: a seemingly meaningless series of numbers repeated over and over, until Laughlin recognizes it as a set of geographical coordinates pointing to Devils Tower near Moorcroft, Wyoming. Lacombe and the U.S. military converge on Wyoming. The United States Army evacuates the area, planting false reports in the media that a train wreck has spilled a toxic nerve gas, all the while preparing a secret landing zone for the UFOs and their occupants.
Meanwhile, Roy's increasingly erratic behavior causes Ronnie to leave him, taking their three children with her. When a despairing Roy inadvertently sees a television news program about the train wreck near Devils Tower, he realizes the mental image of a mountain plaguing him is real. Jillian sees the same broadcast, and she and Roy, as well as others with similar visions and experiences, travel to the site in spite of the false public warnings about nerve gas.
While most of the civilians who are drawn to the site are apprehended by the Army, Roy and Jillian persist and make it to the site just as dozens of UFOs appear in the night sky. The government specialists at the site begin to communicate with the UFOs by use of light and sound on a large electrical billboard. Following this, an enormous mother ship lands at the site, returning people who had been abducted over the past decades, including Barry, and the missing pilots from Flight 19 and sailors from the Cotopaxi, who have not aged since their abductions. The government officials decide to include Roy in a group of people whom they have selected to be potential visitors to the mothership, and hastily prepare him. As the aliens finally emerge from the mothership, they select Roy to join them on their travels. As Roy enters the mothership, one of the aliens pauses for a few moments with the humans. Lacombe uses Curwen hand signs that correspond to the five note alien tonal phrase. The alien replies with the same gestures, smiles, and returns to its ship, which lifts off into the night sky.","strangers,conspiracy,belief,sentimental,vision,aliens,captivating,mash potatoe,driven,contemplative,surprise,anticipation,atmospheric",1073.jpg,1977-11-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/close-encounters-third-kind/id270946850?uo=4,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fxp32VHaYdE,,,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
817,Cloverfield,"Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives.","The film is presented as found footage from a personal video camera recovered by the United States Department of Defense. A disclaimer text states that the footage is of a case designated ""Cloverfield"" and was found in the area ""formerly known as Central Park"". The video consists chiefly of segments taped the night of Friday, May 22, 2009. The newer segments were taped over older video that is shown occasionally.
The first video segment opens when Rob wakes up on the morning of Monday, April 27 having slept with Beth, a previously platonic friend. They make plans to go to Coney Island that day. The footage cuts to May 22, when Rob's brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily prepare a farewell party for Rob who will be moving to Japan. Their friend Hud uses the camera to film testimonials.
After Beth leaves the party, an apparent earthquake strikes, and the city suffers a brief power outage. The local news reports that an oil tanker has capsized near Liberty Island. When the party-goers leave the building, they see the head of the Statue of Liberty crash into the street with several stunning scratch and bite marks. Hud records what appears to be a hand of a large creature several blocks away. The monster causes the Woolworth Building to collapse. Later, during the evacuation of the city, a gigantic tail destroys the Brooklyn Bridge, also killing Jason. News reports show the Army National Guard's 42nd Infantry Division attacking the monster and smaller ""parasite"" creatures falling off its body and attacking people.[4]
Rob listens to a phone message from Beth saying she is trapped in her apartment and unable to move. Going against the crowd, Rob, Hud, Lily, and Marlena (another party guest) venture to Midtown Manhattan to rescue Beth. They run into the Spring Street station because the monster attacked. They are attacked by several of the ""parasite"" creatures inside the subway tunnel, and Marlena is bitten. They enter 59th Street, where they exit the subway. They come across a command center and field hospital, where Marlena inflates and explodes to death. One of the military leaders tells the group when the last evacuation helicopter will depart before the military executes its ""Hammer Down Protocol"", which will destroy Manhattan.
The group rescues Beth, who was impaled on a piece of rebar. The four make their way to the evacuation site, where they encounter the monster once more over Grand Central Terminal. Lily is raced into a departing Marine Corps helicopter. Moments later, Rob, Beth and Hud are taken away in a second helicopter and witness a U.S. Air Force B-2 Spirit bomb the monster. The monster falls, then lunges at the helicopter, causing it to crash into Central Park.


""Clover"" before attacking Hud.
The film skips to Saturday, May 23 (less than an hour later), with a voice on the crashed helicopter's radio warning that the Hammer Down protocol will begin in 15 minutes. The three friends regain consciousness and flee the helicopter. As they leave, the monster kills Hud. Rob and Beth grab the camera and take shelter under Greyshot Arch in Central Park as air raid sirens begin to blare and bombing starts. Rob and Beth take turns leaving their last testimonies of the day. The bridge crumbles and debris covers the camera.[5]","exciting,scary,real,bleak,suspenseful,stylized,rough,fear",817.jpg,2008-01-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cloverfield/id277528737?uo=4,hMPhFVVV-Gw,,,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
399,Clueless,"It's not easy being the most popular and glamorous girl at Beverly Hills High. Especially when you're the envy of scheming Betties (female babes), persistent Barneys (unattractive guys), and teachers who go postal (freak out) when you turn your homework in late! Yet somehow 15-year-old Cher (Alicia Silverstone) keeps it all together, even finding time for extracurricular projects like finding a love match for her debate class teacher (Wallace Shawn), and giving a dowdy friend (Brittany Murphy) a fashion makeover. But Cher's tidy world starts to unravel with the sudden appearance of two total Baldwins (hunks): a sexy and stylish new classmate (Justin Walker), and Cher's square but cute ""ex-stepbrother"" (Paul Rudd). Now Cher is about to learn that when it comes to love, she's ...well, Clueless. Alicia Silverstone is ""absolutely perfect"" (Jeff Craig, Sixty Second Preview) in this hip, sassy comedy that's ""wickedly funny"" (Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) and majorly chronic (for translation, watch the movie!).","Cher Horowitz (Alicia Silverstone) is a good-natured but superficial girl who is attractive, popular, and extremely wealthy. A few months shy of her sixteenth birthday, she has risen to the top of the high-school social scene, and is happy and self-assured in her insular, fashion-obsessed world. She lives in a Beverly Hills mansion with her father Mel (Dan Hedaya), a ferocious $500-an-hour litigator; her mother has long since died, having succumbed to complications while undergoing liposuction surgery. Cher's best friend is Dionne Davenport (Stacey Dash), who is also rich, pretty, and hip, and understands what it's like to be envied.
Among the few people to find much fault with Cher is Josh (Paul Rudd), her socially conscious ex-stepbrother who visits during a break from college. Josh and Cher spar continually but without malice; she refers to him as ""granola breath"" and mocks his scruffy idealism, while he teases her for being selfish, vain, and superficial, and says that her only direction in life is ""toward the mall.""
Illustrating that Cher's selfishness is usually innocent and relatively harmless, Cher plays matchmaker for two lonely, nerdy, hard-grading teachers, Mr. Hall (Wallace Shawn) and Miss Geist (Twink Caplan). She achieves her ostensible purpose‚Äö√Ñ√Æto make them relax their grading standards so she can renegotiate a bad report card‚Äö√Ñ√Æbut when she sees their newfound happiness, she realizes she actually enjoys doing good deeds. Cher now decides that the ultimate way she can give back to the community would be to ""adopt"" a ""tragically unhip"" new girl at school, Tai Frasier (Brittany Murphy). Cher and Dionne give Tai a makeover and initiate her into the mysteries of popularity. Cher also tries to extinguish the strong mutual attraction between Tai and Travis Birkenstock (Breckin Meyer), an amiable skateboarding slacker, and to steer her toward Elton (Jeremy Sisto), a rich snob whose father is a music-industry executive.
Her second matchmaking scheme backfires when Elton rejects Tai and makes a play for Cher. Matters worsen when Cher's ""project"" works a bit too well and Tai's popularity begins to surpass Cher's, especially after Tai has a ""near-death"" misadventure at the mall that helps to skyrocket her to fame at school. Other classmates, including Dionne's and Cher's longtime rival Amber (Elisa Donovan), soon gravitate toward Tai, and Cher finds herself demoted from queen to courtier at high school.
Events reach crisis stage after Cher fails her driver's test and can't ""renegotiate"" the result. When Cher returns home, crushed, Tai confides that she's taken a fancy to Josh and wants Cher to help her ""get"" him. Cher says she doesn't think Josh is right for Tai, and they quarrel. Cher, left all alone, begins to think she has created a monster in her own image. Feeling ""totally clueless,"" she reflects on her priorities and her repeated failures to understand or appreciate the people in her life. Most of all, she keeps thinking about Josh and Tai, and wonders why she cares so much.
After much soul searching (which includes a solo shopping spree around various Beverly Hills boutiques), Cher realizes she has fallen in love with Josh. She begins making awkward but sincere efforts to live a more purposeful life, even captaining the school's Pismo Beach disaster relief effort. A scene near the end of the film finds Cher and Josh stumbling over how to admit their mutual feelings for one another, culminating in a tender kiss on the stairs of her home.
The film has a happy Hollywood ending for Cher: Mr. Hall and Miss Geist get married; her friendships with Tai and Dionne are reaffirmed and solidified; Tai and Travis are in love; and now, in Josh's arms, she too has finally found love.","do the right thing,fashion,popular girl,crimson wave,joy,trust,innocent,witty,humorous,as if,touching,popular,feel good,positive thinking,surprise",399.jpg,1995-07-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/clueless/id300913833?uo=4,yHDcD_xhwAo,384406,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Clueless/384406,"Comedy,Romance"
374,Coach Carter,"Based on an incredible true story, Coach Carter is the inspirational account of controversial basketball coach Ken Carter (Academy Award nominee Samuel L. Jackson), who received both high praise and staunch criticism when he made national news for a gymnasium ""lockout"" of his entire undefeated team for poor academic performance. With the players, the parents, and the community rallying to get the team back on the court, Carter must overcome the obstacles of his environment and show the young men a future that stretches beyond gangs, drugs, prison and even basketball.","Coach Ken Carter (Jackson) takes over the head coaching job for the Oilers basketball team at his old high school Richmond, having played on the team himself, earning unbeaten records. Carter quickly learns that the athletes are rude and disrespectful, and are in need of discipline. He hands the players individual contracts, instructing them to attend all of their classes and maintain a respectable grade point average, among other requirements.
Carter also asks the school staff for progress reports on the players' attendance. However, three players including Timo Cruz (Gonzalez) refuse to follow the contract and quit the team. Carter's son Damien (Ri'chard) later decides to join the team, after quitting the private school St. Francis to play for his father.
Teammate Kenyon Stone (Brown) struggles to come to terms with his girlfriend Kyra (Ashanti) being pregnant; unsure if he can juggle basketball and aspire for college. Later, Cruz makes a valiant effort to rejoin the basketball team after watching them perform at a game in an inspiring victory, to which Carter accepts. The team goes on to post an undefeated record eventually winning a seasonal basketball tournament. However, Carter later discovers the progress reports filled out by the faculty reveal some of the students have been skipping classes and floundering academically.
Carter initiates a lockdown on the gym, banning the team from playing until they improve their grades. The act angers the locals, as Carter is criticized by parents and academic personnel alike. The school board eventually confronts Carter, who justifies his actions, explaining he wants to give his team the opportunity and option for further education so they won't resort to crime. The board, aside from Principal Garrison (Dowse) and the chairman, vote to end the lockout, much to Carter's regret.
Carter quits his job, but finds the team studying in the gym, unwilling to play basketball. The athletes decide to fullfill Carter's original intention of pursuing academic achievement before continuing to play their next game. The Oilers eventually end up competing in the regional high school playoffs, but ultimately lose to St. Francis. Nonetheless, Carter is proud that the players accomplished their goal of attaining a proper education with athletics. The film's epilogue displays a series of graphics stating that a number of players went on to attend college furthering their study.","basketball,record high,richmond high,winner,winning is not everything,teamwork,give their time,teenage pregancy,responsibility,support,belief,commitment,richmond,do what you want,selfless,team,turnaround,buzzer,surge,anger,pushups,suicides,surprise,reap the rewards,right person,choice,joy,support your team,believe,humbled,captivating,be a man,training,nbaallstar,believe in an idea,hire them,discipline,never give up,not over,teen pregnancy,sentimental,time and energy,fat lady sings,sincere,trust,step up,sir,nba all star,nba,touching,push ups,success,respect",374.jpg,2005-01-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/coach-carter/id210158017?uo=4,nOFhHEepF4s,70019004,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Coach_Carter/70019004,Drama
3084,Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky,"The brief love affair between two 20th century icons is dramatized in this period drama from director Jan Kounen. Igor Stravinsky (Mads Mikkelsen) was one of Europe's most promising new composers when in 1913 he premiered his ballet Le Sacre du Printemps (aka The Rite of Spring); the piece proved to be wildly controversial, and the audience at the Paris debut was vocal in their disgust, ruining Stravinsky's reputation for years. One patron who did like the performance was Coco Chanel (Anna Mouglalis), who was already among Europe's most celebrated fashion designers. Seven years later, Chanel encounters Stravinsky at a party, and learns that the composer is penniless and without a place to live. Chanel befriends him, and allows him to move into her summer home in the country along with his wife, Catherine (Elena Morozova), and their four children. Chanel is nursing a broken heart after the recent death of her boyfriend, and what began as an act of compassion for a fellow artist turns into an affair of the heart as Chanel and Stravinsky become lovers, much to the chagrin of the sickly Catherine.","An introductory scene takes place in Paris in 1913, where Coco Chanel attends the first, scandalous performance of Igor Stravinsky‚Äö√Ñ√¥s The Rite of Spring. The rhythmic dissonance of the score and the surprising choreography of the piece result in heckling and outrage among much of the audience. But Chanel is impressed by Stravinsky and his music.
Seven years later, Chanel and Stravinsky meet again. Although her business has flourished, Chanel is mourning the death of her lover, Arthur ""Boy"" Capel. Stravinsky has chosen to flee to France following the Russian Revolution. An immediate sympathy and attraction occurs between the ‚Äö√Ñ√≤couturiere‚Äö√Ñ√¥ and the composer.
Chanel invites Stravinsky to live in her villa outside Paris, along with his ailing wife and their children. The summer months that follow see Chanel and Stravinsky begin an affair, one which Stravinsky's wife cannot avoid becoming aware of. Tensions between Stravinsky and his wife, and between Stravinsky's wife and Chanel, are unavoidable.
The film implies that the affair, and the later termination of the affair by Chanel, has a major influence on the lives of both Chanel and Stravinsky. It is during this time that Chanel creates Chanel No. 5 with her perfumer, Ernest Beaux, and that Stravinsky begins to compose in a new, more liberated style. It is especially implied that the termination of the affair inspired some of the most moving passages in Stravinsky's new composition.",,3084.jpg,2009-07-31, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/coco-chanel-igor-stravinsky/id389945534?uo=4,Brum1qKsADM,70118777,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Coco_Chanel_Igor_Stravinsky/70118777,"Art House & International,Drama"

At the dawn of the Civil War, the men of Cold Mountain, North Carolina, rush to join the Confederate army. Ada (Kidman) has vowed to wait for Inman (Law), but as the war drags on and letters go unanswered, she must find the will to survive. At war's end, hearts will be dashed, dreams fulfilled, and the strength of the human spirit tested ... but not broken! Directed by Academy Award¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫ winner Anthony Minghella (Best Director, THE ENGLISH PATIENT, 1996).","The story is told in a series of flashbacks from the viewpoint of W. P. Inman (Jude Law), a quiet man from a provincial North Carolina town. He meets Ada (Nicole Kidman), the new preacher's daughter. However, as their relationship begins to develop, the Civil War begins and Inman is compelled to join the fray.
The film opens in July 1864 at the Siege of Petersburg. After suffering a serious wound, Inman is sent to a Confederate military hospital where he recovers alongside other soldiers who, like himself, have become disaffected by the prolonged and horrifically destructive war. As he faces the inevitability of being sent back to the war, and after receiving a letter from Ada imploring him to return home to Cold Mountain, he decides to desert the army and sets off in the night to make the perilous journey home.
Inman's journey to return to Ada is fraught with danger and unexpected encounters with other desperate individuals, some treacherous and some sympathetic. He faces starvation, extreme weather, and the constant harassment of the ruthless Confederate Home Guard, led by the vicious Teague (Ray Winstone), sent to track down deserters. He is at times aided in his journey by strangers equally affected by the horrors of war.
As Inman journeys home, Ada is left destitute and desperate back at Cold Mountain after the death of her father.

1652,Cold Souls,"Is your soul weighing you down?  Paul Giamatti has found a solution!  In the surreal comedy COLD SOULS, Paul Giamatti plays an actor named... Paul Giamatti.  Stumbling upon an article in The New Yorker about a high-tech company that extracts, deep-freezes and stores people's souls, Paul very well might have found the key to happiness for which he's been searching.  But, complications arise when he is the unfortunate victim of ""soul-trafficking.""  Giamatti's journey takes him all the way to Russia in hope of retrieving his stolen soul from an ambitious but talentless soap-opera actress.  Balancing a tightrope between deadpan humor & pathos, and reality & fantasy, COLD SOULS is a true soul searching comedy.  Also starring David Strathairn, Dina Korzun and Emily Watson.","Paul Giamatti is an actor who becomes so impassioned with the characters and roles that he plays that he has trouble disassociating himself from the character after the scene is done. As a result, his mind and spirit are a tangled mass of emotions that he seems to have trouble separating from his own feelings. As he struggles to play Uncle Vanya, he reads an article in The New Yorker regarding ""Soul Storage,"" which in fact is a procedural clinic that physically removes one's soul from his body.
While hesitant at first to go through with such a procedure, being unsure how it would affect him, Paul decides to go ahead. On visiting the clinic he discovers that most souls come out as gray matter or clouds. He decides to go ahead, declining the offer to look at his soul as it happens. He is distressed to discover that his soul comes out looking just like a chickpea. He has it stored in the clinic and returns to his life with 5 percent of his soul remaining. However, his life begins to fall apart; he has trouble associating with or making love to his wife Claire. Lacking in emotional intelligence, he says insensitive things, such as telling a friend to just ""pull the plug"" on her comatose mother, and his acting for the Chekhov play lacks believability. Not wanting his soul back just yet, he instead obtains the soul of what he is told is a Russian poet, whose memories entice him to be curious about her and her life as well as obtain a curiosity of his own. This Russian soul allows him to play Uncle Vanya excellently, but the experience overwhelms him and he decides to get his own soul back.
Paul's world is turned upside down when Nina, a Russian soul mule who transports people's souls to and from Russia, steals Paul's soul for the wife of her boss at the Russian soul-storage operation, who aspires to be an actress. She receives Paul's soul, believing it to be the soul of Al Pacino. Her acting and happiness improve. Nina, the mule who carried Paul's soul and has become curious about him, eventually reveals the whereabouts of his soul, helping him to get it back. As the pair investigate the soul of Olga the poet, which he had 'rented' during this period, they learn that she committed suicide after not being able to get it back after selling it. Paul and Nina get his soul back, and after looking into it through the use of special goggles to reassociate himself to it, he returns to New York a happier man. Nina's soul is found, but Paul is told that it is unrecoverable due to the residues of souls that she has carried.","sentimental,contemplative,witty,mind bending,humorous,clever,offbeat,gloomy",1652.jpg,2009-08-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cold-souls/id341305217?uo=4,TLpqToSH8iw,,,"Comedy,Drama"

1701,Conspiracy Theory,,"Jerry Fletcher (Mel Gibson), an obsessive‚Äö√Ñ√¨compulsive New York City taxi driver, visits his friend Alice Sutton (Julia Roberts), who works for the U.S. Attorney, at the Justice Department. She is trying to solve her father's murder. Jerry tells her that NASA is trying to kill the President using a secret weapon on the Space Shuttle that can trigger earthquakes.
Jerry identifies some men on the street as CIA, follows them into a building, and is captured by them. He wakes up in a mental hospital bound to a wheelchair. A doctor (Patrick Stewart) tapes his eyes open, injects him with LSD, and interrogates him using torture. As the LSD kicks in Jerry remembers many previous sessions, which he sees as terrifying cartoons. In a fit of panic, Jerry manages to bite the doctor's nose and sufficiently incapacitate him long enough to escape, still bound to the wheelchair. He manages to shut himself in a laundry truck, escaping the premises. Jerry goes to Alice's office again and grabs a guard's gun, collapsing in Alice's arms.
Alice visits Jerry in the hospital. Handcuffed to the bed and forced to enter a drug-induced sleep, he pleads with her to switch his chart with that of a criminal in the next bed or he will be dead by morning. In the morning, when Alice visits again, the criminal is dead, as he has suffered a mysterious heart attack during the night. The CIA, FBI and other agencies are there. She meets a mysterious CIA psychiatrist, Dr. Jonas. Meanwhile Jerry fakes a heart attack and escapes again, dropping himself down a linen chute. Jerry dresses up as a doctor and escapes the building.
Jonas quizzes Alice over lunch; she explains that Jerry saved her from muggers once, so she tolerates him. In Jerry's hospital room she finds a copy of The Catcher in the Rye. As she discusses it with an FBI officer named Lowry, the CIA come and confiscate all of Jerry's personal items. Lowry offers to share information with her but she declines.
The CIA cannot find Jerry. Alice goes to her car, and finds Jerry hiding in it. She stops the car and speaks with Lowry, who is tailing them, and then they go to Jerry's apartment where he tells her about his conspiracy theories and his newsletter. He has dozens of copies of Catcher. He feels compelled to buy it, but doesn't know why. They are interrupted when Jerry's alarm goes off, signaling the entry of a CIA SWAT team. Jerry sets everything on fire and they leave by his secret trapdoor exit. In the room below, there is a large mural on the wall, which features both Alice and the triple smokestacks of a factory near the mental institution.
The pair go to Alice's apartment and he reveals he's been watching her through her window. She kicks him out. Outside, Jerry confronts Lowry and his partner staking out her place, and he warns them, at gunpoint, not to hurt her. He goes to a book store and buys a copy of Catcher. The CIA detects his purchase, and sends agents to catch him. Jerry sees their black helicopters with men rappelling down and goes into a theater. He yells ""there's a bomb under my chair"" and manages to escape during the resulting panic.
The next morning, Alice has been calling each person who gets the newsletter, and they have all died that night except one. Jerry uses a ruse to get her out of the office, and then attaches cables from the CIA vehicle following her to a vendor's cart. On a bus they discuss more of his theories. In a subway station where one Herriman drowned in another conspiracy, she agrees to check the autopsy. He says he loves her and she rejects him.
Alice goes to see the last surviving person on the subscription list, and it is Jonas. He explains that Jerry was an MK-ULTRA subject but the project was terminated - except for his research. Jonas shows her a photo of her father taken from Jerry's locker, and claims that Jerry went out of control and killed her father. She is crushed.
Jerry sends Alice a pizza containing a message to meet him. Jonas gets her to agree to a homing device in the pizza box and Jerry drives her with the box across the Queensboro bridge. He has made previous arrangements that enable him to ditch the agents following them, leaving the homing device behind. As he drives her to her father's private horse stables, Jerry tells her that he can almost remember what happened and is taking her to where ""the music is playing."" Alice turns on her mobile phone so they can still track her. At the stables Jerry remembers that he was sent to kill her father (a judge who was about to expose Jonas' operation) but found he couldn't kill him. Instead they became friends and Jerry promised to watch over Alice before the judge was killed by another assassin. She admits she switched the charts in the hospital. The CIA arrive and capture Jerry. Jonas gloats but Jerry says, ""you've never seen her run."" Alice outruns the men; a sniper misses her, killing the last guy chasing her, and she escapes.
Jonas tortures Jerry again. Meanwhile, Alice leads the FBI men (who are not actually FBI but from a ""secret agency that watches the other agencies"") to Jonas' office, but it has been entirely dismantled. Declining Lowry's help, Alice starts searching for Jerry. She realizes that a detail of Jerry's large mural is near a mental hospital and goes there. She bribes an attendant to show her an unused wing, breaks in through locked doors, and finds Jerry after hearing him singing through the ventilation ducts. As Jonas catches them, Lowry arrives with his men and attacks Jonas's men. Jerry attempts to drown Jonas but is shot once. In retaliation, Alice shoots Jonas dead. Alice tells Jerry she loves him as he is taken away in an ambulance.
Some time later, Alice visits Jerry's grave, leaving his union pin upon it, before returning to horse riding. As she rides away, Jerry, Lowry and Flip watching her. Jerry is not allowed to contact her until they are sure they have rounded up all of Jonas' other subjects. He secretly lets her know he is still alive by placing his union pin on her horse's saddle","suspenseful,fear",1701.jpg,1997-08-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/conspiracy-theory/id279598765?uo=4,hv1xBLvwHMI,1172103,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Conspiracy_Theory/1172103,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
1886,Constantine,"Based on the DC Comics/Vertigo Hellblazer graphic novels and written by Kevin Brodbin and Frank Cappello, Constantine tells the story of John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a man who has literally been to hell and back. When he teams up with skeptical policewoman Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz) to solve the mysterious suicide of her twin sister, their investigation takes them through the world of demons and angels that exists just beneath the landscape of contemporary Los Angeles. Caught in a catastrophic series of otherworldly events, the two become inextricably involved and seek to find their own peace at whatever cost.","John Constantine is an exorcist who lives in Los Angeles. Born with the power to see angels and demons on Earth, he committed suicide at age 15 after being unable to cope with his visions. Constantine was revived by paramedics but spent two minutes in Hell. He knows that because of his actions his soul is condemned to damnation when he dies, and has recently learned that he has developed cancer as a result of his smoking habit.
After a case involving a full-fledged demon trying to break onto the ""human plane,"" Constantine seeks an audience with the androgynous half-breed angel Gabriel. He asks Gabriel for a reprieve from death so that he can continue fighting demons, which Gabriel declines. Constantine is told that his exorcisms will not gain him a reprieve from Hell because his motives are selfish. As he leaves, Constantine repels an attack by a full-fledged demon out in the open. This encounter prompts him to meet with former witch doctor Papa Midnite. While there Constantine also encounters half-breed demon Balthazar (Gavin Rossdale), who informs him that all of Hell is waiting for him to die and that he is the one soul Satan would come to Earth personally to collect. Constantine begins investigating the situation with his associates Beeman, Hennessy, and Chas Kramer. L.A.P.D. Detective Angela Dodson also shows up at Constantine's apartment looking for his help with her investigation into her twin sister Isabel's death. Isabel leapt to her death from the top of a mental hospital, and despite camera footage showing it Angela is convinced that Isabel would never commit suicide. At first Constantine mocks her and denies her request for help, but after demons attack Angela on the street outside Constantine agrees to look into her sister's death. He informs Angela that God and Lucifer are engaged in a proxy war; a standing wager for the souls of all mankind. Neither true angels nor demons can manifest on Earth, but they are allowed to possess and influence humans. Both sides also use ""half-breeds"" to peddle influence for their cause.
Hennessy and Beeman's findings lead Constantine to the conclusion that Mammon, Lucifer's son, is seeking to create his own kingdom on Earth by breaking through onto the human plane. To do so, Mammon requires a powerful psychic and assistance from God. Balthazar begins killing Constantine's associates and Angela reveals that she and her sister possessed the same gift as Constantine. Angela refused her visions and they went dormant, but Isabel tried to tell everyone about them and was institutionalized for it. Constantine reawakens Angela's psychic ability through a near death experience, then hunts down and interrogates Balthazar who reveals that Mammon has obtained the Spear of Destiny, which has the blood of Jesus Christ encrusted on it. The psychic Mammon needs is Angela, who is abducted by an unseen force and taken to Isabel's hospital to be used as the portal for Mammon‚Äö√Ñ√¥s entrance to Earth. Constantine convinces Midnite to allow him to use ""The Chair"", an old electric chair from Sing Sing Prison that had killed over 200 inmates. The Chair shows Constantine a vision that the spear was discovered in Mexico and has been brought to Los Angeles. Constantine and Chas head to the hospital and interrupt the ritual, but Chas is beaten to death by an unseen force in the process.
Using incantations and sigils tattooed on his arms, Constantine forces Gabriel to be revealed. Gabriel subdues Constantine immediately and reveals that the plan to release Mammon was Gabriel's. Gabriel laments God‚Äö√Ñ√¥s favoritism towards humans and believes that bringing Hell to Earth will enable those who survive to become truly worthy of God‚Äö√Ñ√¥s love through repentance and faith. Gabriel then throws Constantine from the room and begins to draw forth Mammon. As Gabriel moves to stab Angela with the Spear and release Mammon, Constantine slits his wrists. Time stops as Lucifer arrives to personally collect his soul. Constantine tells Lucifer about Mammon‚Äö√Ñ√¥s plan and Lucifer sends Mammon back to Hell. When Gabriel attempts to smite Lucifer, the angel's wings are burned away and Gabriel becomes human. In return for his help, Lucifer grants Constantine a favor. He asks Lucifer to allow Isabel to go to Heaven. As Lucifer drags Constantine towards Hell, he is redeemed by his self sacrifice and begins to rise into Heaven. Infuriated by the idea of losing Constantine's soul, Lucifer heals his wounds and cures John of his cancer; so that he may continue to live and ""prove to God that your(John's) soul truly belong's in Hell"". Constantine departs with the Spear after refusing the temptation to kill Gabriel, and gives the Spear to Angela instructing her to hide it, then forget it. As he watches her leave, instead of producing a cigarette, he starts to chew on some nicotine gum.
In closing, Constantine visits Chas' grave. He leaves his lighter that he always used. When he leaves, Chas appears as an angel (wearing Gabriel's old clothing) and flies upward to the sky. Constantine smiles, shakes his head and leaves.","scary,angel,suspenseful,hell,mind bending,stylized,devil,atmospheric,fear",1886.jpg,2005-02-08, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/constantine/id282563603?uo=4,,70019508,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Constantine/70019508,"Action & Adventure,Horror,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
703,Contact,"Two-time Oscar-winner Jodie Foster (""Panic Room"") and Matthew McConaughey (""The Wedding Planner"") star in this gripping story of a radio astronomer who receives the first extraterrestrial radio signal ever picked up on Earth. As the world powers scramble to decipher the message and decide upon a course of action, she vies to fulfill her dream of becoming the first human being to make contact with alien beings. Co-starring Oscar-nominee and Emmy-winner James Woods (""Any Given Sunday,"" ""True Crime""), Oscar-nominee John Hurt (""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone""), Emmy-winner Tom Skerritt (TV's ""Picket Fences""), Oscar-nominee Angela Bassett (""How Stella Got Her Groove Back"") and Rob Lowe (TV's ""The West Wing""). Directed by Academy Award-winner Robert Zemeckis (""Cast Away,"" ""What Lies Beneath""). Based on the novel by renowned author/physicist Carl Sagan.","Encouraged to explore as a child by her late father, Dr. Eleanor ""Ellie"" Arroway works for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) program at the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. She listens to radio transmissions hoping to find signals sent by extraterrestrial life. Government scientist David Drumlin pulls the funding from SETI because he believes the endeavor is futile. Arroway gains backing from secretive billionaire industrialist S. R. Hadden, who has followed her career and allows her to continue her studies at the Very Large Array (VLA) in Socorro County, New Mexico.
Four years later, with Drumlin seeking to close SETI, Arroway finds a signal repeating a sequence of prime numbers, apparently sent from the star Vega. This announcement causes Drumlin and the National Security Council, led by National Security Advisor Michael Kitz, to attempt to take control of the facility. As Arroway, Drumlin and Kitz argue, members of the team at the VLA discover a video source buried in the signal: Adolf Hitler's welcoming address at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin. Arroway and her team postulate that this would have been the first significantly strong television signal to leave Earth's atmosphere, which was then transmitted back from Vega, 26 light years away.
The project is put under tight security and its progress followed worldwide. Arroway learns that the signal contains more than 60,000 ""pages"" of what appear to be technical drawings. Hadden decodes the pages; the drawings are meant to be interpreted in three dimensions. This reveals a complex machine allowing for one human occupant inside a pod to be dropped into three spinning rings.
The nations of the world fund the construction of the machine in Cape Canaveral at the Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39. An international panel is assembled to choose a candidate to travel in the machine. Although Arroway is one of the top selections, Christian philosopher Palmer Joss, a panel member whom Arroway met in Puerto Rico and with whom she had a brief romantic encounter, brings attention to her lack of religious faith. As this differentiates her from most humans, the panel selects Drumlin as more representative. On the day the machine is tested, a religious fanatic destroys the machine in a suicide bombing, killing Drumlin and many others.
Hadden reveals to Arroway that a second machine is hidden in Hokkaido, Japan, and that Arroway will be its pilot. Arroway, outfitted with several recording devices, is locked into the pod of the Japanese machine, dropped into the spinning rings, and disappears. When the pod apparently travels through a series of wormholes, she experiences displacement and can observe the outside environment, including a radio array‚Äö√Ñ√¨like structure at Vega and signs of an advanced civilization on an unknown planet. Arroway finds herself in a surreal beachfront landscape similar to a childhood picture she drew of Pensacola, Florida, and a blurry figure approaches that becomes her deceased father. Arroway recognizes him as an alien taking her father's form and attempts to ask questions. The alien deflects her inquiries, explaining that this journey was just humanity's first step to joining other spacefaring species.
Arroway considers these answers and falls unconscious. She awakens to find herself on the floor of the pod; the machine's control team is repeatedly calling for her. She learns that from outside the machine it appears the pod merely dropped through the machine's rings and landed in the safety net. Arroway insists that she was gone for approximately 18 hours, but her recording devices show only static. Kitz resigns as national security advisor to lead a congressional committee to determine whether the machine was a hoax designed by Hadden, who has died. Arroway is described as an unwitting accomplice in the hoax; she asks them to accept her testimony on faith. Kitz and White House Chief of Staff Rachel Constantine reflect on the fact that while Arroway's recording device only recorded static, it recorded 18 hours of it. Arroway and Joss reunite, and Arroway receives ongoing financial support for the SETI program at the Very Large Array.","suspenseful,sincere,contemplative,stylized,scientist,clever,first contact,atmospheric,anticipation,captivating",703.jpg,1997-07-11, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/contact/id279598767?uo=4,SRoj3jK37Vc,1171788,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Contact/1171788,"Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
7304,Contagion,"Soon after her return from a business trip to Hong Kong, Beth Emhoff dies from what is a flu or some other type of infection. Her young son dies later the same day. Her husband Mitch however seems immune. Thus begins the spread of a deadly infection. For doctors and administrators at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, several days pass before anyone realizes the extent or gravity of this new infection. They must first identify the type of virus in question and then find a means of combating it, a process that will likely take several months. As the contagion spreads to millions of people worldwide, societal order begins to break down as people panic.","After a business trip to Macao, businesswoman Beth Emhoff (Gwyneth Paltrow) stops in Chicago to have a sexual encounter with an old boyfriend before returning to her family in suburban Minneapolis. At first, she appears to have contracted a cold during her trip. Her son, Clark, also becomes symptomatic and is sent home from school. Beth's condition worsens and two days later she collapses with severe seizures in her home. Her husband, Mitch (Matt Damon), rushes her to the hospital, but she continues to have seizures and dies of an unknown cause. Because it affects the brain and central nervous system, pathologists attribute it to a meningoencephalitis virus. Mitch returns home and finds that Clark has also died from a similar infection. Mitch is put in isolation but turns out to be immune to the disease. He and his teenaged daughter attempt to flee the city, but a military quarantine has been imposed, and they're forced to return to their home to face decaying social order and rampant looting of stores and homes. Not knowing whether his daughter inherited his immunity, Mitch struggles with her frustration with quarantine with his desire to protect her, while trying to come to terms with his own loss.
In Atlanta, representatives of the Department of Homeland Security meet with Dr. Ellis Cheever (Laurence Fishburne) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and express fears that the disease is a bioweapon intended to cause terror over the Thanksgiving weekend. Cheever sends Dr. Erin Mears (Kate Winslet), an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer, to Minneapolis to begin the investigation. In addition to tracing the outbreak back to Beth, Dr. Mears has to negotiate with local bureaucrats reluctant to commit resources. She later becomes infected with the disease. The Minnesota National Guard arrives to quarantine the city, and Dr. Mears is moved to the field medical station she helped set up, where she later dies.
At the CDC, Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle) finds that the virus is mix of genetic material from pig and bat viruses. Investigations into cures via treatment protocols or vaccines initially stalls as scientists can't find a cell culture to grow the new virus, which has been named the Meningoencephalitis Virus One (MEV-1). Professor Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) violates orders from CDC scientist Dr. Hextall to destroy his samples and identifies a line of bat cells that will support research of a vaccine. At the CDC, Dr. Hextall uses this breakthrough to begin to investigate possible vaccines. The virus turns out to spread via fomites with a basic reproduction number of two. This later goes up to four after the virus mutates.
Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law), a conspiracy theorist, posts videos about the disease, and in one of them appears sick and later claims that he recovered using a homeopathic cure derived from forsythia. People attempting to obtain forsythia overwhelm pharmacies, accelerating the contagion as infected and healthy people congregate. Krumwiede leaps to national attention and, during a television interview, accuses Dr. Cheever of informing friends and family to leave Chicago before a quarantine is imposed. It is later revealed Krumwiede was never sick with the virus, but was attempting to boost demand on behalf of investors in the companies producing and distributing the homeopathic treatment. He is arrested for conspiracy and fraud, but is soon released after his 12 million blog readers collect and pay his bail.
Dr. Hextall identifies a potential vaccine, using an attenuated virus. Because of the difficulties of human subjects testing, she follows the precedent of other vaccine researchers and inoculates herself first. Hextall visits her gravely ill father in the hospital to expose herself to the virus and test the vaccine. The vaccine's production is rapidly ramped up and the CDC awards vaccinations via a random lottery based on birth dates for one full year until every survivor is vaccinated. Dr. Cheever, whose phone call to his girlfriend warning her to leave Chicago ahead of the quarantine, was overheard by the CDC's janitor, later gives his fast-tracked MEV-1 vaccination to the janitor's son. Dr. Hextall places the MEV-1 virus's surviving samples in cryogenic storage with H1N1 and SARS.
Dr. Leonora Orantes (Marion Cotillard), a World Health Organization epidemiologist, travels to Hong Kong to trace the origins of the infections. She collaborates with Sun Feng (Chin Han) and other local epidemiologists and public health officials and they identify Beth Emhoff as patient zero. As the virus spreads, Feng kidnaps Orantes to use her as leverage to obtain the first MEV-1 vaccines for his village. Orantes spends months living with the villagers until the vaccine is announced. Feng exchanges Orantes for the vaccines, which turn out to be placebos. When she is informed of this, Orantes, who has grown close to the villagers, rushes away to warn them.
In the film's final moments, an extended flashback explains the virus's outbreak. A man driving a bulldozer that works for Beth's company knocks down a palm tree where bats are nesting. The bats become disturbed and fly away. One of the bats is carrying a virus; it flies onto a banana plant and eats a chunk of the banana. The bat then roosts on a water supply pipe, over a pig pen. The bat drops a chunk of the banana out of its mouth and into the pig pen, where a pig eats the banana, and demonstrates the chain of contagion with the bat's disease, creating a bat-pig hybrid. The next day, a group of Chinese chefs collect piglets from the same pen and take them to a casino. One of the chefs butchers the diseased piglet and is shown preparing it for roasting. The chef is approached and called away from his preparations, and casually wipes his hands on his apron. He greets and shakes hands with Beth Emhoff, making her patient zero as the origin of the MEV-1 Virus.",,7304.jpg,2012-03-05,,4sYSyuuLk5g,70185071,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Contagion/70185071,"Mystery & Suspense,Drama"

It is revealed that Sebastian has been working with Briggs, as gangster Jim Church (David O'Hara) threatens to kill Sebastian if he doesn't repay money he borrowed to save his fledgling construction business. When Sebastian calls Chris, Chris tells him that he might drop the drugs Andy bought into the ocean‚Äö√Ñ√Æangry that Andy had done the cocaine side deal. Sebastian tells Briggs, who assaults Kate and warns her to tell Chris to not dump the ""package"".
Kate calls Chris and tells him what Briggs said to her. Chris is surprised that Briggs knew about dumping the drugs, realizing that Sebastian had to have told him. Kate does not know and goes back to Sebastian's apartment to retrieve some personal items. When Sebastian tries to force himself on her, he accidentally bashes her head against a bathtub. Sebastian thinks she is dead and throws her (unconscious) body in a yet to be poured foundation.
Sebastian contacts the cargo ship's Captain Camp (J K Simmons), tells him that Chris is smuggling on his ship, and promises him a share if he makes sure Chris doesn't throw it overboard. When Chris does not give up the contraband, Camp calls the C.B.P. to meet the ship in New Orleans. The C.B.P. agents find the container with Chris' van, but the van is empty save for the paint splattered tarp.
Once Chris is on shore, Briggs and his thugs demand the drug package. Chris takes Briggs to Camp's house, having made a duplicate key while on the ship, and knowingly activates the security system. Chris opens Camp's personal carpet cleaner, which Camp had aboard the ship, and retrieves the cocaine from the carpet cleaner's water tank. While Briggs and his gang sit in Camp's living room with the cocaine, Chris sneaks out in Camp's car. Camp awakens to the noise and comes into the living room as the police arrive. Both Briggs and Camp are arrested, in possession of the cocaine.
Chris goes to Sebastian's construction site and brutally beats him, demanding Kate's location. When Sebastian tells Chris that she's dead, he tries calling her cellphone and hears the ringtone in a building foundation where cement is being poured and rescues her. Sebastian is arrested and sent to prison, where he has to answer to Chris's prisoner father.
Danny retrieves the fake bills, which we learn Chris had dumped into the Mississippi River before docking in New Orleans. Needing a vehicle to transport the bills, Andy buys the escape van, which the C.B.P. had confiscated from the cargo ship, at a C.B.P. auction. Church pays Chris $3 million for the fake currency and asks if he knows anything about a Jackson Pollock painting stolen from an armored car in Panama, telling him that it's worth $140 million and can be fenced for over $20 million on the black market. Chris, Andy and Danny find the painting ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the nondescript paint splattered tarp ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ still in the van.
Following Chris and Andy's involvement in multiple killings, drug smuggling, trading in counterfeit currency, framing the ship's captain for a crime he did not commit, and selling a stolen art masterpiece, the film ends with Chris, Kate, Andy and the kids living a comfortable life in a waterfront house.","risky,drugs,wife,family,trust,fear",2188.jpg,2012-01-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/contraband/id501939731?uo=4,,70213465,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Contraband/70213465,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense"
535,Control,"Ian Curtis has aspirations beyond the trappings of small town life in 1970's England. Wanting to emulate his musical heroes, such as David Bowie and Iggy Pop, he joins a band, and his musical ambition begins to thrive. Soon though, the everyday fears and emotions, that fuel his music, slowly begin to eat away at him. Married young, with a daughter, he is distracted from his family commitments by a new love and the growing expectations of his band, Joy Division. The strain manifests itself in his health. With epilepsy adding to his guilt and depression, desperation takes hold. Surrendering to the weight on his shoulders, Ian's tortured soul consumes him.","Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) and Debbie Woodruff (Samantha Morton) marry in 1975 in their home town of Macclesfield at ages 19 and 18, respectively. Ian retreats from domestic life, preferring to write poetry in solitude. In July 1976 they attend a Sex Pistols concert with Bernard Sumner (James Anthony Pearson), Peter Hook (Joe Anderson), and Terry Mason (Andrew Sheridan), who are starting a band. Mesmerized by the concert, Ian volunteers to be their singer. They name themselves Warsaw, and Terry moves into a managerial role with the addition of drummer Stephen Morris (Harry Treadaway). The band debuts 19 May 1977 and soon rename themselves Joy Division. Ian and Debbie finance their first EP, An Ideal for Living (1978).
During his job as an employment agent, Ian witnesses a seizure suffered by Corinne Lewis (Nicola Harrison). Unsatisfied with the brief mention Joy Division receives from television host Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson), Ian demands that he put the band on his programme. In April 1978 Joy Division plays a battle of bands, impressing Tony and Rob Gretton (Toby Kebbell), who becomes their new manager. They perform ""Transmission"" on Tony's programme and sign to his Factory Records label; Tony signs the contract using his own blood.
In December 1978 Ian suffers a seizure on the way back from the band's first London gig; He is diagnosed with epilepsy and prescribed medications that leave him drowsy and moody.

Ian suffers a seizure mid-performance and is comforted by Annik, who admits she is falling in love with him. He attempts suicide by overdosing on phenobarbital but doctors save his life. He continues to perform, but is exhausted by the strain and overwhelmed by the audience's expectations. At a performance at the Derby Hall the stress proves too much and he is unable to go onstage.

Ian tells Tony that he believes everyone hates him and that it is his own fault. When Debbie learns that Ian is still seeing Annik, she demands a divorce. Bernard attempts to use hypnotherapy on Ian, who then goes to stay with his parents. He writes to Annik admitting his fear that his epilepsy will eventually kill him, and confesses that he loves her.

1615,Cool Hand Luke,"Luke Jackson is a cool, gutsy prisoner in a Southern chain gang, who, while refusing to buckle under to authority, keeps escaping and being recaptured. The prisoners admire Luke because, as Dragline explains it, ""You're an original, that's what you are!"" Nevertheless, the camp staff actively works to crush Luke until he finally breaks. ","Lucas ""Luke"" Jackson (Paul Newman) is arrested for cutting the heads off parking meters one drunken night in the early 1960s. He is sentenced to two years in prison and sent to a Florida chain gang prison run by a heartless warden, the Captain (Strother Martin). Luke turns out to be a decorated Korean War veteran.
Luke fails to observe the established pecking order among the prisoners and quickly runs afoul of the prisoners' de facto leader Dragline (George Kennedy). When the pair have a boxing match, the prisoners and guards watch with interest. Although Luke is severely outmatched by the larger Dragline, he won't stay down, and eventually Dragline refuses to continue the fight. Luke takes a beating but earns the respect of Dragline and the rest. Later, Luke wins a poker game by bluffing with a hand worth nothing. Luke comments that ""sometimes nothing can be a real cool hand,"" and Dragline promptly bestows on him the prison nickname ""Cool Hand Luke.""
After receiving a visit from his sick mother, Luke becomes more optimistic about his situation. The other prisoners start to idolize him after he makes and wins a spur-of-the moment bet that he can eat fifty hard-boiled eggs in one hour. Luke continually confronts the Captain and the guards, and his sense of humor and independence in the face of incarceration prove to be both contagious and inspiring to the other prisoners. This struggle for supremacy peaks when Luke leads the work crew in a seemingly impossible but successful effort to complete a road-paving job in less than a single day.
After news of his mother's death reaches Luke, the Captain, anticipating that Luke might attempt escape in order to attend his mother's funeral, locks him in the prison punishment box. After this, Luke is determined to escape. After an initial escape attempt under the cover of a Fourth of July celebration, he is recaptured by local police and fitted with leg irons to prevent further attempts. Upon his return, the Captain delivers a warning speech to the other inmates, beginning with the famous line, ""What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach. So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it...well, he gets it. I don't like it any more than you men.""
Some time later, Luke escapes again, first visiting a nearby house where he uses an axe to remove his chains and spreads curry powder to throw off the prison's tracking Bloodhounds. This escape is successful but short-lived. While free, Luke mails the prisoners a magazine that includes a photograph of him with two beautiful women. He is soon recaptured and beaten, then returned to the prison camp and fitted with two sets of leg chains. Luke is now annoyed by the other prisoners' fawning and lashes out spitefully, revealing that the picture in the magazine was a fake. At first the other prisoners are angry, but after a long stay in the box, when Luke is being forced to eat a huge serving of rice, the other prisoners help him to finish it.
As punishment for his escape, time and again he is forced to dig a grave-sized hole in the prison camp yard, fill it back in, then be beaten by the guards. Finally, as the other prisoners watch from the windows of the bunk house, an exhausted Luke collapses in the hole, begging God for mercy and the bosses not to hit him again. Believing Luke is finally broken, the Captain stops the punishment. Shamed by Luke's capitulation to the Captain, the prisoners begin to lose their idealized image of Luke. A prisoner pulls out the magazine with Luke's picture in it and tears it up.
Though seemingly broken in spirit, Luke takes one last stab at freedom when he gets the chance to steal a prison dump truck. Dragline impulsively jumps in the truck with Luke and they drive off. They travel until at night near a church, Luke tells Dragline that they should split up. Saddened and regretful, Dragline thanks Luke as they part and Luke enters the church. Here, Luke decides to talk with God, who he believes made him the way he is but is sabotaging him so he cannot win in life. Luke prays and asks God what he should do but gets no reply. Moments later, police cars arrive outside. Dragline enters the church and tells Luke that he made a deal with the bosses and that they won't hurt them if they surrender peacefully. Luke, knowing better, moves to an open window and mimics the Captain's famous line, ""What we've got here is a failure to communicate"". Luke is immediately shot in the neck by Boss Godfrey. A distraught Dragline carries Luke outside then attacks Boss Godfrey, but is stopped by the other guards. When the sheriff (Rance Howard) says he's called ahead to the local hospital, the Captain insists he is taking Luke to the prison hospital. When the sheriff says that it's an hour's drive away and that Luke would never survive, the Captain says ""He's ours.""
Later, Dragline and the other prisoners reminisce about Luke. Dragline describes Luke's unique smile as scenes of Luke's escapades flash across the screen. The final image before the screen fades to black is a now-repaired picture of Luke and the two women, superimposed on an aerial view of a cross-shaped road junction.",,1615.jpg,1967-11-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cool-hand-luke/id282715645?uo=4,,397323,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cool_Hand_Luke/397323,"Classics,Comedy,Drama"
3068,Cool Runnings,"Based on a true story, this is the comedic saga of four Jamaican athletes going to extremes to compete as bobsled racers at the Winter Olympics.","Irving ""Irv"" Blitzer was an American bobsled two time Gold Medalist at the 1968 Winter Olympics who finished first in two events again during the 1972 Winter Olympics but was disqualified from the latter for cheating and retired in disgrace to Jamaica, where he leads an impoverished life as a bookie. Irving is approached by two Jamaican athletes: top 100m runner Derice Bannock, who failed to qualify for the 1988 Summer Olympics when another opponent tripped him at the trials, and Sanka Coffie, a champion push cart racer.
The athletes wish to use Irving's previous experience as a Coach in order to compete in the 1988 Winter Olympics as bobsledders. Irving had been good friends with Derice's father, Ben, a former sprinter whom Irving had tried to recruit for the bobsled team years ago, who is presumed to be deceased. Yul Brenner, another runner who was tripped at the qualifier, joins the team as does as Junior Bevil, the runner who tripped Yul and Derice. Eventually Irving is convinced to coach the team.
The four try to find various ways to earn money to get in the Olympics; singing on the street, arm wrestling, and holding a kissing booth, but all fail. Junior, however, sells his car, which gets the team the money that they need.
In Calgary, Irving manages to acquire an old practice sled, as the Jamaicans have never been in an actual bobsled. The Jamaicans are looked down upon by other countries, in particular the East German team whose arrogant leader, Josef, tells them to go home, resulting in a bar fight. The team resolves to view the contest more seriously, continuing to train and improve their technique. They qualify for the finals, but are briefly disqualified. At the primary judge meeting, Irving immediately confronts his former coach from the '72 Olympic Winter Games Kurt Hemphill, now a primary judge of the '88 Olympic Winter Games, for disqualifying the Jamaicans for his mistake. He confesses that he made the biggest mistake in his life by cheating by hiding weights underneath the sled to make it run faster. Irving‚Äö√Ñ√¥s 1972 Gold Medals were revoked and he embarrassed his country with the scandal. He says that if Hemphill wants revenge, just punish him, not his team. He begs Hemphill to let the Jamaicans qualify and represent their country in the Olympics. Later, the judges overturn their decision and the Jamaicans are back in.
The Jamaicans' first day on the track results in more embarrassment and a last place finish. Sanka convinces Derice to stop copying qualities of the Swiss team. Once the team develops their own style, the second day proves ; the Jamaican team finishes with a fast time which puts them in eighth position. Later, Irving tells Derice the truth about his past and convinces him to think of himself as a champion even if he doesn't win the gold, saying, ""A gold medal is a wonderful thing, but if you're not enough without it, you'll never be enough with it.""
For the first half of the final day's race it looks as though they will break the world bobsled speed record, until tragedy strikes: their sled, due to one of the blades falling off, flips on its side coming out of a turn towards the end of their run, leaving them meters short of the finish line. However, the team lifts the sled over their shoulders and walks across the finish line to rousing applause from spectators, including Josef, Hempill, and Junior's father. The team, at the end, feels accomplished enough to return in four years to the next winter Olympics. A brief epilogue states the team returned to Jamaica as heroes and upon their return to the Winter Olympics four years later, they were treated as equals.","exciting,feel good,humorous",3068.jpg,1993-10-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cool-runnings/id351314818?uo=4,wLlmymHRNZg,397368,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cool_Runnings/397368,Comedy

Freddy Heflin who was always admired by the New York cops wanted to become one, but because he was deaf in one ear this prevents him from achieving his goal, but has become sheriff of Garrison. Recently there have been a dark omen surrounding the NYPD, and Freddy is now investigating on this case, then Internal Affairs officer Mo Tilden is also on the case and asks Freddy for help, but Freddy could not. Now Freddy suspects that a New York cop named Ray Donlan might be one of the many cops who is corrupted by the mob and other criminals. Now, Freddy must find a cop who is nicknamed ""Superboy"" who can testify against Donlan and protect him, before Donlan finds Superboy and kills him.","Set in the town of Garrison, New Jersey,[2] located across the Hudson River from New York City, a large number of residents are NYPD Officers.
One night, the car of young cop Murray ""Superboy"" Babitch (Rapaport), nephew of Lt. Ray Donlan (Keitel), is sideswiped on the George Washington Bridge by a couple of African-American teens. Thinking they had fired at him, Babitch fires back and the teens are killed in the ensuing crash.
Worried about a possible racial incident, Ray's solution is to fake a suicide, pretending that Babitch jumped off the bridge. When a corrupt cop, Jack Rucker (Patrick), is caught trying to plant a weapon to justify the shooting, other corrupt Officers, including Det. Leo Crasky (Spencer) and Frank Lagonda (Nascarella), fear Babitch will resurface and testify to Internal Affairs.
IA Investigator Lt. Moe Tilden (De Niro) asks Garrison's mild-mannered half deaf Sheriff Freddy Heflin (Stallone) to provide information on the corrupt cops who live in his town. Though they work in a different city, Freddy views them as brothers and is reluctant to betray them, derailing Moe's investigation.
Freddy is secretly in love with Liz Randone (Annabella Sciorra), whose life he once saved in a near-drowning that cost him the hearing in one ear. The deafness prevented Freddy from joining the NYPD like so many others in town, including the man Liz eventually married, the abusive and unfaithful Joey Randone (Berg).
Although the cover-up at first seems successful, Ray is told by Patrolmen's Defense Association President Vincent Lassaro (Vincent) that without a body, the case will not stay cold. Ray reluctantly decides that his nephew should be killed. Babitch is tipped off by his aunt Rose (Cathy Moriarty) and escapes. He goes to Freddy's house looking for help, but when he sees Freddy's friend (and fellow NYPD cop) Gary ""Figgsy"" Figgis (Liotta), he flees. Earlier that night, Joey falls to his death on duty, aided by the fact that Ray took his time getting there (revenge for Joey's sexual affair with Ray's wife).
When Freddy realizes his mistake, he returns to Moe, but is angrily told that the case was blown by his failure to co-operate earlier. As he is shown the door, Freddy steals several NYPD files on the case. Back in his office, he studies the files and realizes the extent of his friends' corruption. Deputy Cindy Betts (Janeane Garofalo) decides to leave Garrison, frustrated by the New York cops having turned the town into their own personal fiefdom. Freddy returns home to find Figgsy packing to leave, not wanting to be further involved.
Freddy tells his Deputies what he is doing. Freddy also finds out that Figgsy burned down his own house, for the insurance money, accidentally resulting in the death of his crack-addicted girlfriend Monica (Mel Gorham). Freddy persuades Rose to reveal where her nephew is hiding. Freddy finds him and takes him to Garrison's jail. Soon after, Freddy's Deputy Bill Geisler (Noah Emmerich) leaves to tend to his pregnant wife.
Freddy attempts to take Babitch to New York to turn over to IA, but they are ambushed, Jack fires a gun next to Freddy's good ear and Babitch is taken. Knowing that Babitch has been taken to Ray's house to be killed, Freddy prepares to take them on by himself. A shootout follows, with Freddy killing Jack and Frank. Freddy is then shot in the shoulder by Leo, but is saved by the arrival of Figgsy, who kills Leo. Freddy and Figgsy continue into the house where Babitch is trying to escape through a window. Ray sneaks up behind Freddy, but before he can fire, Figgsy shoots at Ray but misses. Barely hearing the shot, Freddy turns and fatally shoots Ray. As Ray lies dying on the floor, he mutters obscenities toward Freddy, to which Freddy replies simply; ""I can't hear you, Ray.""
Later, after the scandal has been investigated and indictments handed down, Freddy, who has recovered, is seen looking at the New York skyline from across the Hudson. Deputy Geisler notifies him about a jack-knifed truck and Freddy goes back to work.","do the right thing,honesty,stand up for the truth,do what ever it takes,be yourself,surprise,against all odds,be good,fear",2418.jpg,1997-08-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cop-land/id432472904?uo=4,,60036640,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cop_Land/60036640,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Armed with a seeing stone provided by the real Spink and Forcible, Coraline returns to the Other World and challenges the Other Mother to a game to find her missing parents and the eyes of the ghost children in the Other World, agreeing to stay in the Other World if she loses. Coraline uses her seeing stone to find the ghosts' eyes and outwits the twisted inhabitants of the Other World guarding them, and later finds her parents trapped in a snow globe. Knowing that the Other Mother will never let her leave even if she wins, Coraline tricks the Other Mother into opening the door to the real world and escapes through it, closing the door on the Other Mother's hand and severing it. Coraline finds her parents safe with no memory of what had happened, and the ghost children at peace. To keep the Other Mother from returning, Coraline intends to drop the key to the door between her world and the Other World down a water well near her house, but the Other Mother's severed hand enters Coraline's world and tries to drag Coraline back to the Other World.

As revolution ignites on the streets, Eric plummets into a downward spiral of sex, violence and destruction. Riding across Manhattan in a stretch limo in order to get a haircut, a 28-year-old billionaire asset manager's day devolves into an odyssey with a cast of characters that start to tear his world apart. ","A 28-year-old billionaire stock speculator/asset manager Eric Packer (Robert Pattinson), rides slowly across Manhattan, despite traffic jams, in his state-of-the-art luxury stretch limousine that he uses as his office, while on his way to his preferred barber. The traffic jams are caused by a visit of the President of the United States and by the funeral of Eric's favorite musician, a Sufi rap artist whose music he plays in one of his two private elevators. Despite his clearly plummeting fortunes, Packer fantasizes about buying the Mark Rothko Chapel. He has recently married; in the car and elsewhere, he has meetings with his wife, who no longer wants to have sex with him. Instead, he has sex with other women. Meanwhile, anti-capitalist activists on the street demonstrate by waving rats and declaring that ""A specter is haunting the world: the specter of capitalism"". They spray-paint Packer's limo, and he is later subjected to a pieing by one of the activists. Packer learns that an assassin is out to kill him, but seems curiously uninterested in who the person might be.
In his car, while having a meeting, he has his doctor carry out his daily medical checkup; Eric worries about the doctor's finding that he has an asymmetrical prostate. After devastating currency speculation, which wipes out most of his fortune, his world begins to disintegrate. Eventually he kills his bodyguard. Arriving at the barber, who knew his father, Packer has his hair cut on one side. The barber and the black limo driver discuss their respective careers driving cabs and the barber, learning that Packer has thrown away his gun, gives him his own gun. Packer follows a path of further self-destruction, including visiting his potential murderer, Benno Levin, a man who used to work for him. Packer seems likely to commit suicide but instead deliberately shoots himself in the hand. The murderer, who feels adrift in the capitalist system, explains to Packer that his mistake in speculating was looking for perfect symmetry and patterns in the stock market; instead, he should have looked for the lopsided - his body with its asymmetrical prostate was telling him this. The film ends with the potential murderer holding a gun to Eric's head and threatening to kill him, but a final shot is not shown.",,7269.jpg,2012-06-15,https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cosmopolis/id574362115?uo=4,q3ZmIwteUAY,70242545,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cosmopolis/70242545,Drama

When tragedy hits home, these men are left wrestling with their hopes, their fears, their faith, and their fathering. Can a newfound urgency help these dads draw closer to God ... and to their children?","As the police force of Albany, Georgia, attempts to stop gangs and drug dealing activity in the city, the sheriff urges his deputies to spend time with their families, citing research that shows fatherless children are several times more likely to get into trouble in life, including crime. Among his deputies are Adam Mitchell (Alex Kendrick), Nathan Hayes (Ken Bevel), Shane Fuller (Kevin Downes), and rookie David Thomson (Ben Davies). Mitchell adores his young daughter, but is distant from his teenage son. Hayes never knew his biological father but would risk his life to save his two children; however, his teenage daughter Jade (Taylor Hutcherson), resents him because he has strict rules about dating. Fuller is divorced, as were his parents, and has joint custody of his son. Thomson is young and single. The group also befriends Javier Martinez (Robert Amaya), an immigrant struggling to provide for his family, and Mitchell recommends him to a new full-time job, where he is hired.
Mitchell's daughter is killed by a drunk driver, devastating Mitchell and his family. Following his daughter's death, Mitchell reads a lot about fatherhood in the Bible. He decides he must be a better father and crafts a detailed ""Resolution"" to honor God in every aspect of his family. Mitchell, Hayes, Fuller, Thomson, and Martinez join him in his resolution at a formal ceremony conducted by Hayes's neighborhood mentor, the man he thinks of as a father. Mitchell rebuilds a relationship with his son and receives some relief of his guilt at his daughter's death. Hayes mends his relationship with his daughter and presents her with a purity ring that he asks her to wear until she is married. He also visits the grave of his biological father who he had never met and forgives him. Fuller improves his relationship with his son. Thomson reveals that he fathered a child in college and deserted the mother after she refused to have an abortion. He writes the mother a letter seeking a relationship with his daughter and encloses some support money. Martinez's factory employer offers him a promotion on the condition that he falsify inventory documents. Martinez refuses, and his boss reveals that the request was a test of Martinez's integrity. The boss promotes Martinez and gives him a raise.
Mitchell discovers that Fuller has been stealing drugs from police evidence. Mitchell decides he must honor his Resolution and decides to report the corruption. He sets up a sting leading to Fuller's arrest and imprisonment. Mitchell visits Fuller in jail where Fuller takes responsibility for his actions and asks Mitchell to look after his son, which Mitchell agrees to do.
During a minor traffic stop, Hayes and Thomson unknowingly confront the armed leader of a gang they have been repeatedly encountering. The incident turns into a roadside gun battle, and the gang leader attempts to take a young girl hostage. Mitchell and other officers arrive as backup. The girl's father helps Hayes subdue a suspect, and Mitchell assists in arresting a second suspect. One of the gang members is Derrick Freeman (David Howze), a teenager who Hayes had earlier prohibited from dating his daughter; Derrick attributes his decisions to his lack of a father.
At a Father's Day church service, the men present the Resolution and Mitchell urges the fathers in the congregation to be a Godly influence on their families. Mitchell runs in a 5K race with his son and Fuller's son. Hayes reads the Bible in prison with Derrick. Thomson meets his daughter for the first time. The film ends with a quote from Joshua 24:15: ""Choose today who you will serve, but as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord.""","emotional,sincere,uplifting,touching,contemplative",1555.jpg,2011-08-26, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/courageous/id492436757?uo=4,i9VT_NBIVfs,70202144,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Courageous/70202144,Drama
7333,Cracks,"CRACKS, the dazzling debut film from Jordan Scott (daughter of legendary director Ridley Scott), stars Eva Green as Miss G, a glamorous force in an idyllic British boarding school. The school's most elite clique, led by Di (Juno Temple), rule the school and compete for the attention of Miss G, who thrives on the girls' fascination and eggs them on with lessons in a scandalously liberated world view. But, when a beautiful Spanish girl, Fiamma (Maria Valverde), appears at the school, the girls are immediately threatened by the outsider's perfect allure. Even Miss G, who loved being the most glamorous presence in her girls' lives, becomes obsessed with, threatened and tantalized by Fiamma.","Set in a strict elite British boarding school in the 1930s, the story centers on a clique of girls who idolize their enigmatic diving instructor, Miss G (Green) (in the film, we learn that Miss G had been a student at the same school where she now works and, in fact, may have even continued on at the school after she graduated). Di Radfield (Temple) has a crush on Miss G, and is the firm favourite and ringleader of her group. When a beautiful Spanish girl named Fiamma Coronna (Valverde) arrives at the school, Miss G's focus is shifted away from the other girls. It becomes a triangle: Miss G gets increasingly obsessed with Fiamma, Fiamma is disturbed by Miss G and also openly disgusted by the teacher's hypocrisies and deceptions, and Di is terribly jealous and makes Fiamma's life hell. In a very telling scene in the film that clearly highlighted Miss G's deceptions, Miss G (who claimed to be a world traveller to her ""girls"") goes to a nearby parochial town to buy some provisions. She is visibly upset by this trip and after buying her provisions and drawing the unwanted attention of some local louts, she returns to the school in, it would seem, a near panic. The bullying culminates in Di physically throwing Fiamma out of the school but, as she is unable to return to Spain as she hoped, Fiamma ends up back at the school later that night.
When Fiamma is eventually found, the two girls make the first steps towards friendship, and at the following dorm party they all get a bit drunk, and Fiamma faints. Miss G takes her to her own room. Then Miss G kisses her and sexually touches her; Di witnesses this through the room door, which was left ajar, and then flees.
The next morning, Fiamma is visibly upset, Miss G equally so as she runs around after her. Di is broody, and eventually tells the rest of her gang that Fiamma seduced Miss G. Fiamma presumably tells Miss G that she will report the molestation to the teachers, and horrified, Miss G realises her career will be over. She in turn manipulates Di's affection for her into anger. She says that Fiamma will make up lies about her molesting her (even though it was true) and plan to get her kicked out of school. Di absolutely refuses to allow this to happen. The confrontation between Di's gang and Fiamma turns ugly as Fiamma declines to answer Di's vicious questions and tries to explain what really happened, hinting at Miss G's lies and character defects. Fiamma runs into the forest as things become more violent, but the girls catch up with her and, under Di's leadership, beat her up with their fists and sticks. Fiamma starts to have an asthma attack, and the girls stop, terrified. They run to get help, and Di runs into Miss G (who had been watching the beating and the chase that ensued quietly and with no attempt to stop the beating), who says she'll stay with Fiamma, and directs Di to go get a teacher.
In the forest, Miss G, alone with Fiamma, refuses to give Fiamma her inhaler and calmly watches her die. Di returns just in time to see Miss G placing the inhaler in Fiamma's lifeless hand, and that's when she realizes the truth.
Later, Di tells the other girls what happened and, united, they confront Miss G. They are powerless officially, but they quit the swim team and symbolically turn in their sashes. The headmistress refuses to acknowledge the school's culpability, and seems only concerned with the school's reputation, but releases Miss G from her duties.
The final scene has Di leaving the school to explore the world, as both Fiamma and Miss G had spoken of doing, whilst Miss G, fired from the school, goes to the local village and finds a small room she can live in, presumably closing herself away for the rest of her life. In a scene that perhaps allows the viewer a better understanding of Miss G's very complex personality, we see her put her few personal possessions on her bedside table. She puts one item there and then quickly removes it to make room for another item. After that, she counts the items to make sure there are only five. The viewer is then reminded that when Fiamma arrived at the school, in the dorm room, Di had told her that only five personal items could displayed on her night table at one time. The audience then realizes Miss G is as much a victim of the institutionalized setting she grew up in (she was perhaps like many of the girls at the school ""dumped"" there and basically forgotten about by her family) as Fiamma was her victim.[5]",,7333.jpg,2011-03-18,https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cracks/id446603499?uo=4,,70123014,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cracks/70123014,Drama
975,Crank,The hit-man Chev Chelios is poisoned by the criminal Verona and his friend and doctor Miles advises him that he must keep his adrenaline in an upper level to stay alive. Chev meets his girlfriend Eve and together he looks for Verona to kill him.,"Carlito (Carlos Sanz) leads a wealthy and influential Mexican-American crime syndicate in Los Angeles. Worried about encroachment from a Chinese syndicate, Carlito orders the contract killing of their leader, Don Kim (Keone Young). Carlito's best hitman, a British man called Chev Chelios (Jason Statham), is given the job. However, after the hit, the anger of the Chinese is much greater than Carlito expected. Carlito regrets the hit, deeming it ""ill-advised"". Carlito tells the Chinese the hit had nothing to do with him, and he will remove the elements in his own organization who were responsible.
Ricky Verona (Jose Pablo Cantillo), a small time criminal and long-time rival of Chelios, uses the opportunity to conspire with Carlito against Chelios. While Chelios sleeps in his apartment, Verona breaks in and injects Chelios with a synthetic drug (referred to once as ""The Beijing Cocktail"" and every other time as ""The Chinese Shit"") inhibiting the flow of adrenaline, slowing the heart and eventually killing the victim. Chelios wakes to find a recorded video explaining that Chelios should have about an hour left before the poison stops his heart.
Chelios phones Doc Miles (Dwight Yoakam), a personal physician to the Mafia, who informs Chelios that in order to survive he must keep his adrenaline pumping through constant excitement and danger, or get some artificial adrenaline, epinephrine. With his own adrenaline keeping the poison at bay at first, Chelios breaks into a hospital and steals numerous drugs, much more than Doc Miles advises him to take and also gets ""juiced"" by a hit from a defibrilator. He also keeps his adrenaline up through reckless and dangerous acts like picking fights with other gangsters, stealing things, committing robberies, fighting with police, having sex with his girlfriend in public and driving a car through a shopping mall.
The entire film takes place in a single day, on November 7, 2005, over the course of which Chelios sets out to find Verona and his street gang through Chelios' street contact Kaylo (Efren Ramirez), a flamboyant homosexual. Chelios also picks up his girlfriend Eve (Amy Smart) before Verona's thugs get to her. Chelios attempts to sexually assault Eve while she strongly resists in the middle of a busy street in Chinatown, while hundreds of people look on, in order to keep his adrenaline up; she eventually appears to consent and they proceed to have sex, still amidst a crowd of onlookers.[2]
It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s eventually revealed that Chelios spared Don Kim's life and told him to leave LA. Chelios arranges a rooftop meeting with Carlito, Verona, and their henchmen, who promise him a fake antidote. Don Kim arrives along with his Triads to assist Chelios, and a shootout follows, killing many of Carlito‚Äö√Ñ√¥s men. Carlito himself is killed by Verona, who then tries to leave in Carlito's helicopter. The film concludes with Chelios' confronting Verona in the helicopter, out of which they both fall over the course of battle. Chelios breaks Verona's neck mid-air and, still falling, calls Eve on his cell phone, to apologize for not coming back. Chelios hits a car, bounces off it and lands right in front of the camera. In the last shot, it is implied that his adrenaline is indeed still flowing fast; his nostrils flare, he blinks, and two heartbeats are heard.","exciting,suspenseful,anger,stylized,rough,surprise,shock",975.jpg,2006-08-31, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/crank/id284827606?uo=4,uEXsOqdzYhE,70051668,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Crank/70051668,"Action & Adventure,Comedy,Mystery & Suspense"
3574,Crash,"Over a thirty-six hour period in Los Angeles, a handful of disparate people's lives intertwine as they deal with the tense race relations that belie life in the city. Among the players are: the Caucasian district attorney, who uses race as a political card; his Caucasian wife, who, having recently been carjacked by two black men, believes that her stereotypical views of non-whites is justified and cannot be considered racism; the two black carjackers who use their race both to their advantage and as an excuse; partnered Caucasian police constables, one who is a racist and uses his authority to harass non-whites, and the other who hates his partner because of those racist views, but who may have the same underlying values in his subconscious; a black film director and his black wife, who believes her husband doesn't support their black background enough, especially in light of an incident with the racist white cop; partnered police detectives and sometimes lovers, one Hispanic female and the other black male, the latter who is dealing with a drugged out mother that feels he isn't concerned enough about taking care of family; an East Asian man who is run over but who is hiding some valuable cargo in the back of his van; a Persian store owner, who feels he isn't getting satisfaction from American society when his store is robbed time and time again; and a Hispanic locksmith, who just wants to keep his family, especially his adolescent daughter, safe in a seemingly unsafe world.","Los Angeles detectives Graham Waters (Don Cheadle) and his partner Ria (Jennifer Esposito) approach a crime scene investigation. Waters exits the car to check out the scene. One day prior, Farhad (Shaun Toub), a Persian shop owner, and his daughter, Dorri (Bahar Soomekh), argue with each other in front of a gun store owner as Farhad tries to buy a revolver. The shop keeper grows impatient and orders an infuriated Farhad outside. Dorri defiantly finishes the gun purchase, which she had opposed. The purchase entitles the buyer to one box of ammunition. She selects a red box.
In another part of town, Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), the local district attorney, and his wife, Jean (Sandra Bullock), are carjacked as they are about to enter their Lincoln Navigator, by Anthony (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) and Peter (Larenz Tate). Later, at the Cabot house, Hispanic locksmith Daniel Ruiz (Michael Pe‚àö¬±a) is changing their locks when he overhears Jean complaining about having been carjacked earlier by two black men and now having to endure a heavily tattooed Hispanic with a shaved head changing their locks, because she is sure he is going to leave and give copies of the new keys to ""his other gang members."" Detectives Waters and Ria next arrive at the scene of a shooting between two drivers. The surviving shooter is a white male, identified as an undercover police officer. The dead shooter, a black male, is revealed also to be an undercover police officer. There is a large amount of cash found in the black officer's trunk. This is the third time the white officer has shot and killed a black man.
LAPD officer John Ryan (Matt Dillon) and his partner, Tom Hansen (Ryan Phillippe), begin their evening patrol. They pull over a Navigator similar to the one carjacked earlier, despite discrepancies in the descriptions of the carjackers and in the license plate numbers. They order the couple, TV director Cameron Thayer (Terrence Howard) and his wife Christine (Thandie Newton), to exit. Cameron is cooperative, but Christine has had a few drinks and is argumentative. This annoys Ryan, who sexually molests Christine under the pretense of administering a pat-down; intimidated, Cameron says nothing. The couple is released without a citation. Once home, Christine becomes enraged that Cameron did nothing while she was being violated. Cameron insists that what he did was correct and storms out. Arriving home from work long after dark, Daniel finds his young daughter, Lara, hiding under her bed after hearing a gunshot outside. To comfort her, Daniel gives her an ""invisible impenetrable cloak,"" which makes her feel safe enough to fall asleep in her bed. In the carjacked SUV, Anthony and Peter, arguing and distracted, hit something while passing a parked white van. Stopping, they discover that they have run over an Asian man, now trapped under the SUV. They argue about what to do with him, finally dumping him in front of a hospital and driving away.
The next day, at the LAPD station, Hansen talks to his superior, Lt. Dixon (Keith David), about switching partners. Dixon, a black man, claims that Hansen's charge of Ryan as a racist could cost both Hansen and Dixon their jobs. Dixon suggests a transfer to a one-man car and mockingly tells Hansen that he should justify it by claiming to have uncontrollable flatulence. Ryan visits Shaniqua Johnson (Loretta Devine), a ""managed care"" insurance representative with whom he argued earlier. Apologizing for insulting her previously, he explains that his father was previously diagnosed with a bladder infection but he fears the diagnosis is incorrect and that it may be prostate cancer. Ryan wants him to see a different doctor, but Shaniqua icily informs him that the health plan won't cover it. Daniel is seen replacing a lock at Farhad's shop and tries to explain to him that the door frame is shattered and not secure and needs to be replaced. Farhad, whose English is limited, misunderstands and accuses Daniel of cheating him and refuses to pay. The next morning, Farhad discovers the store has been looted, wrecked and tagged with graffiti. His insurance company does not cover the damage, calling it a case of negligence, as he had been advised to replace the door and did not. Farhad looks for and finds Daniel's full name on the discarded invoice and vows revenge. Detective Waters visits his mother, a some-time hard drug abuser. She asks him to find his missing younger brother; he promises and takes notice that there is almost no food in the apartment as he is leaving.
In the studio where Cameron works, a white producer, Fred (Tony Danza), suggests that a black actor isn't acting ""black"" enough, as he was using proper grammar. Cameron had been satisfied with the take just completed, but Fred strongly suggests that another take be done, with the black actor speaking more ""black."" Cameron initially pushes back but, threatened with his job, he concedes. Ryan comes across a car accident and as he crawls into the overturned vehicle, he finds Christine, who is trapped. Upon recognizing Ryan, Christine becomes hysterical, screaming for him to leave her alone and refusing his help, but gasoline is leaking from the tank and running downhill towards another wreck, which has already caught fire. He calms her down, and with the assistance of his partner and spectators, Ryan pulls Christine out just as her car bursts into flames. A confused but grateful Christine is taken away by EMTs. Anthony and Peter attempt to carjack Cameron. Cameron has reached his limit of being pushed around, and he resists the attempt. Cameron starts punching Anthony. Anthony tells Peter to shoot Cameron, but Peter does not. Instead, he tries to break the fight up. As police officers arrive, Cameron and Anthony both race for the car and jump in. Cameron drives away, with Anthony continuing to hold a gun on him. A car chase ensues; one of the police responders to the chase is Tom Hansen, who recognizes the vehicle as the one he and Ryan pulled over the night before. Cameron drives to a dead end, grabs Anthony's gun, and gets out of the car, all the while yelling insults at the officers. Just before he pulls out the gun, Hansen convinces him to stop aggravating the situation and just go home. Hansen vouches for Cameron to the other officers, telling them that Cameron has no prior history of breaking the law and promises to give him a ""harsh warning."" All depart. Cameron tells Anthony that as a black man he is embarrassed for him and gives back the gun as he drops Anthony at a bus stop.
Using the White Pages of the phone book, Farhad locates Daniel's home address and travels there with his gun. As Daniel's wife Elizabeth (Karina Arroyave) watches in horror, Farhad shoots at Daniel at point-blank range -- just as Daniel's daughter Lara jumps into his arms to protect her father with the ""invisible cloak."" It takes the grief-stricken parents a moment to realize that Lara is miraculously unharmed; the red box of ammunition that Dorri had selected contained blanks, rendering Farhad's gun harmless. Farhad later tells his daughter that he believes that the little girl was his angel, saving him from committing a terrible crime. Peter, who is hitchhiking, is picked up by Hansen. They awkwardly try to bridge the gap between their cultures. Peter sees that Hansen has a small statuette of Saint Christopher, which he also has. He begins to laugh as he realizes that there is no difference between the two of them, but Hansen thinks that he is being racist. Peter then pulls his statuette out of his pocket, but Hansen thinks it is a gun and shoots and kills Peter. Hansen dumps the body and then torches his own car in another part of town. Peter is revealed to be Waters' missing brother. Waters and his mother meet up at the morgue, and Waters promises to find who is responsible. His mother tells him not to bother, as she blames him for his brother's death. Anthony returns to the white van owned by the Asian man that they had run over earlier. Finding the keys still hanging from the door lock, he drives the van away. Kim Lee (the Asian woman from the crash at the film's opening) arrives at a hospital looking for her husband Choi Jin Gui, the man Anthony and Peter ran over. Conscious and coherent, he tells her to go and immediately cash a check that he has in his wallet. Anthony has driven the white van to a chop shop he frequents, and as they inspect the van, a number of Asian immigrants are discovered to be chained and locked in the back of the van, revealing that Choi was, in fact, involved in human trafficking. Anthony is offered $500 for each person in the van.
The last scene of the film shows the white van being parked in Chinatown, where Anthony walks to the back, opens the van, and sets the Asians free. He tells the uncomprehending passengers that ""this is America,"" and he gives $40 to one of the men, telling him to buy everyone some ""chop suey"" to eat. As Anthony drives away, he passes a minor crash, which turns out to involve Shaniqua. The film closes as Shaniqua and the other driver, who rear-ended her car, hurl racial insults at one another.","accident,life,hassle,la,los angeles,coincidence,surprise,fate",3574.jpg,2005-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/crash-2004/id265545301?uo=4,durNwe9pL0E,70023961,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Crash/70023961,Drama

Burt, a 32-year-old, married attorney, and Linda, a beautiful, single 20-year-old girl living in the Bronx, had a whirlwind romance, which culminated in a violent and psychologically complex set of actions that landed the pair's saga on the cover of endless newspapers and magazines.","In 1959, spurned lover Burt Pugach hired thugs to throw sodium hydroxide in the face of ex-girlfriend Linda Riss, leaving her blind and permanently disfigured.

She still loves him but not what he's become. That rut has even led to her having an affair with her co-worker, David Lindhagen, who would like that relationship to be permanent. A young, handsome, well appointed, and seemingly wealthy young man named Jacob Palmer notices what a sad sack of a man Cal is because of his situation. Jacob, a Lothario of a man who can have his pick of women with who he only wants one-night stands, offers to help Cal get his manly mojo back to make Emily regret ever wanting to divorce him, and make him move on with his life. Although Cal accepts Jacob's help, the one part he may not really want is moving on from Emily. As Jacob helps Cal, Jacob himself may come to the realization that there is more to life than one-night stands, especially after he meets a young law student named Hannah, who is going through her own relationship issues. A happy romantic ending for both Cal and Jacob with their respective loves is hindered by some unknown information, including Cal's best friend's seventeen year old daughter, Jessica Riley, being secretly in love with him, while Cal's thirteen year old son, Robbie Weaver, is in turn in love with Jessica. ","The Movie: Expert womaniser Ryan Gosling teaches Steve Carell a few pick-up tips, even though he's pining for the one that got away (Emma Stone). A thinking person's rom-com oozing with sex appeal.

Released in the UK the same week as Drive, this made Gosling the inescapable man of the moment. The film also reignited the debate about crazy, stupid movie title punctuation.Ryan Gosling with a spray tan and a gym membership could sell any movie. 

But if girls queue up to witness the fitness, Crazy Stupid Love is really a male-odrama with equal appeal for the fellas. 

Your first clue that this movie is more interesting than its title? Not many Hollywood romcoms have more directors than screenwriters. 

Deftly knitted together by scribe Dan Fogelman (Tangled) and directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa (I Love You Phillip Morris), the plot splinters out of the shattered life of happily married Cal (Steve Carell), who discovers his wife (Julianne Moore) has cheated and wants a divorce.

Cal's not the only one in a pickle: his son (Jonah Bobo) yearns for the babysitter, the babysitter yearns for Cal and his wife is dating co-worker Kevin Bacon. Enter slick pick-up artist Jacob (Ryan Gosling) to transform Cal from loser into playa. 

As Jacob gives Cal a man-over and unleashes him on barfly Marisa Tomei, the script brings the smarts but the cast bring the heart. 

Carell's the sincere everyman wearing his broken heart on his sleeve, while Gosling is effortlessly smooth and, crucially, likeable enough to dodge the character's in-built sleaze. 

You'll wish it dug a little deeper into its characters _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü not least Emma Stone, massively cool in an underwritten role _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü but it's a romcom that puts smart moves on genre conventions. 

It's a funny movie that tiptoes into serious adult pain, and it's full of witty touches from Cal's agonising Velcro wallet to Stone demanding an R-rated sex scene with Gosling. Fair enough _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü this boy is top-shelf.


Not a bromance, not a girlie romcom, not perfect. But Crazy Stupid Love is funnier, smarter and more touching than your average cut-out-andkeep Hollywood relationship flick.

1679,Cronos,"In 1535, an alchemist builds an extraordinary mechanism encapsulated into a small golden device. The invention, designed to convey eternal life to its owner, survives its maker until 1997, when it shows up with an antiques dealer. Fascinated with the strange device, Gris (Luppi) doesn't note that there's more than one person looking for it. The promise of eternal life has become an obsession for old and sick Mr. De la Guardia (Brook). He and his nephew (Perlman) will do anything to get the Chronos Invention.","In the year 1535, an alchemist in Vera Cruz developed a mechanism that could give eternal life. In 1937, an old building has collapsed and an alchemist with marble white skin is killed when his heart is pierced by the debris. Investigators never revealed what else was discovered in the building: basins filled with blood from a corpse.
In the present, an old antique dealer, Jes‚àö‚à´s Gris (Luppi), notices that the base of an archangel statue is hollow. He opens it and finds a 450-year-old mechanical device in the base. After winding the ornate, golden, scarab-shaped device, it suddenly unfurls spider-like legs that grip him tightly, and it inserts a needle into his skin which injects him with an unidentified solution.
A living insect ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ entombed within the device and meshed with the internal clockwork ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ produces the solution. However, Gris is unaware of this detail until later.
Eventually, he discovers that his health and vigor are returning in abundance, as is his youth. His skin loses its wrinkles, his hair thickens and his sexual appetite increases. He also develops a thirst for blood. This at first disgusts him, but he eventually succumbs to the temptation.
Meanwhile, a rich, dying businessman, Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook), who has been amassing information about the device for many years, has been searching for the archangel statue with the cronos device. He has appropriated several archangels already. He sends his thuggish nephew, Angel (Perlman), to purchase the archangel at the antique shop.
During a party, Gris sees blood on a men's-room floor and decides to lick it. Angel then finds Gris and tries to beat him into giving up the device. When Gris faints, Angel places his body inside a car and pushes it off a cliff. Gris dies but later revives and escapes from an undertaker's establishment before he can be cremated. He later reads the program for his funeral and opens his mouth which had been sewn shut.
He returns to his home where his granddaughter, Aurora, lets him in. He works on a letter to his wife where he comments on the changes that his body has made and tells her that after completing some 'unfinished business' he will return to her. He notices that his skin burns in the presence of sunlight and sleeps in a box to avoid it.
Eventually, he and Aurora bring the device to Dieter's business headquarters, where the businessman offers him a ""way out"" in exchange for the device. Gris comments on his damaged skin and the businessman tells him to peel it off because he has new skin underneath, which is marble white like the dead alchemist. Jes‚àö‚à´s agrees to hand it over in exchange for knowing the ""way out"", whereupon Dieter stabs him. Before being able to strike the killing blow to the chest, Dieter is incapacitated by Aurora. The mortally wounded Dieter is found and killed by his nephew, Angel, who is tired of waiting for his inheritance. Angel confronts Jes‚àö‚à´s on the rooftop of the building and beats him severely. Jes‚àö‚à´s throws them both off the roof, killing Angel. Upon awakening, Jes‚àö‚à´s destroys the device and returns home, greatly weakened. Jes‚àö‚à´s, now with marble white skin, lies dying in bed. Aurora and his wife are by his side.",,1679.jpg,1993-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cronos/id474354682?uo=4,cc4T64SxoZA,70154855,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cronos/70154855,"Art House & International,Drama,Horror,Mystery & Suspense"
3323,Crude Independence,"Crude Independence is a documentary film about the heartland in the process of transplanting itself, and the new heart is pumping oil. In 2006, the United States Geological Survey estimated there to be more than 200 billion barrels of crude oil resting in a previously unreachable formation beneath western North Dakota. With the advent of new drilling technologies, oil companies from far and wide descended on small towns across the state with men and machinery in tow. Director Noah Hutton takes us to the town of Stanley (population 1300), sitting atop the largest oil discovery in the history of the North American continent, and captures the change wrought by the unprecedented boom in the years since the discovery. Through revealing interviews and breathtaking imagery of the northern plains, Crude Independence is a rumination on the future of small town America's tale of change at the hands of the global energy market and America's unyielding thirst for oil.",,,3323.jpg,2009-02-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/crude-independence/id328977293?uo=4,,70114960,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Crude_Independence/70114960,Documentary
3739,Cruel Intentions,"Sarah Michelle Gellar (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream 2, TV's Buffy The Vampire Slayer) and Ryan Phillippe (I Know What You Did Last Summer, 54) sizzle as a pair of unscrupulous siblings in a deliciously sexy tale of seduction, revenge and conquest. After cleverly seducing and ruining the reputation of an unsuspecting classmate (Selma Blair, Can't Hardly Wait, Zoe, Duncan, Jack & Jane), the sparks fly when Kathryn (Gellar) poses the ultimate challenge to her insatiable stepbrother Sebastian (Phillippe): deflower the Headmaster's beautiful, virgin daughter Annette (Reese Witherspoon, Pleasantville, The Man In The Moon). If he fails, Kathryn gets his most prized possession, but if he succeeds, Sebastian gets to possess and bed Kathryn. The stakes are high, but for Sebastian, the payoff is feverishly irresistible and before the summer's over, no one will escape their relentless game of cat and mouse until one of them is bitten by the most unlikely sensation of all ...love.","The wealthy and popular Kathryn Merteuil (Gellar) takes the sheltered and na‚àö√òve Cecile Caldwell (Blair) under her wing, promising to turn Cecile into a model student. Kathryn's real intention, however, is to use Cecile to indirectly take revenge on Court Reynolds, her ex-lover, who had dumped her for Cecile. Kathryn asks her step-brother, Sebastian Valmont (Phillippe), to seduce Cecile; he refuses as he is planning to seduce virgin Annette Hargrove (Witherspoon) - a 'paradigm of chastity and virtue' and spoil her social reputation. Doubting Sebastian's chance of success, they make a wager: If Kathryn wins, she gets Sebastian's vintage 1956 Jaguar XK140 roadster; if Sebastian wins, Kathryn will allow him to ""put it anywhere"" (an oblique reference to anal sex). Sebastian agrees.
Ronald Clifford, Cecile's music teacher, is also in love with Cecile. Annette is temporarily staying with Helen Rosemond, Sebastian's Aunt. Cecile's mother, Mrs. Caldwell, who met Annette at her school, has already warned Annette of Sebastian's reputation for womanizing. Sebastian's seduction of Annette fails. Wanting revenge on the Caldwells, Sebastian tells Kathryn he will now seduce Cecile. Kathryn tells Cecile's mother about Ronald and Cecile's romance and Mrs. Caldwell intervenes in her daughter's relationship. Sebastian, in turn, calls Cecile to his house, ostensibly to give her a letter from Ronald. Sebastian blackmails Cecile and performs oral sex on her. The next day, Cecile confides in Kathryn, who advises her to learn the art of sex from Sebastian so that she can make Ronald happy in bed.
Sebastian falls in love with Annette, who returns his feelings but resists him. Sebastian calls her a hypocrite because she claims to be waiting for her one true love, but when her one true love chooses to love her back, she resists. She relents, but Sebastian, in turn, refuses her. Annette flees to her friend's parents' estate. Sebastian tracks her down and professes his love, and they make love. As he has won the bet, Kathryn offers herself to Sebastian the next day, but he refuses; he now wants Annette only. Kathryn taunts him and threatens to ruin Annette's reputation, so Sebastian pretends indifference to Annette and coldly breaks up with her.
After Sebastian tells Kathryn that he has broken up with Annette and arranged for Cecile and Ronald to be together, Kathryn reveals that she has known all along that he was truly in love with Annette and manipulated him into giving her up. She then rejects him. Sebastian leaves, and Kathryn calls Ronald to inform him that Sebastian had sex with Cecile. Sebastian finds and sends Annette his journal, in which he has detailed all of Kathryn's maneuvers and written his true feelings for Annette. When Sebastian starts heading home, Ronald confronts him in the middle of the street and a fight ensues. Annette runs out and tries to stop it. She is thrown into the way of an oncoming cab. Sebastian pushes her to safety and is hit by the speeding cab himself. Before he dies, Sebastian and Annette profess their love for each other.
At Sebastian's funeral, Cecile distributes copies of Sebastian's journal, made into a book by Annette, titled ""Cruel Intentions"". Kathryn is humiliated and rejected by her former friends, and she is defamed for the cocaine hidden in her cross necklace. Annette drives away in Sebastian's Jaguar with his journal at her side as fond memories of Sebastian play through her head.","disgust,biting,cynical,temptation,sexual,clever,trick,deceit,cruel",3739.jpg,1999-03-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/cruel-intentions/id278762951?uo=4,dnWp4Jq32Zw,18962136,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Cruel_Intentions/18962136,Drama
2426,Curious George,"""Buckle up for this amusing, exciting and hilarious adventure"" (Janet Stokes, Film Advisory Board, Inc.) with everyone's favorite inquisitive little monkey! When The Man In The Yellow Hat befriends Curious George in the jungle, they set off on a non-stop, fun-filled journey through the wonders of the big city toward the warmth of true friendship. Featuring the voice talents of Will Ferrell, Drew Barrymore and an all-star cast, Curious George is ""a family classic"" (Dean Richards, WGN-TV) that will have the kid inside everyone giggling with delight again and again!","A clumsy, mischievous, friendly and curious monkey named George (Frank Welker) lives in the jungles of Africa. His behavior amuses the other young jungle animals, but angers their parents; therefore George is left sad and alone.
Meanwhile, at the Bloomsberry Museum, Ted (Will Ferrell), a museum employee, teaches schoolchildren about natural history, not realizing that his lectures bore them. Afterward, he has a talk with Maggie (Drew Barrymore), the school teacher, who admires him and for whom he has strong feelings. Later, Mr. Bloomsberry (Dick Van Dyke), the owner of the museum, tells Ted that he is pressed to close the museum by his son, Bloomsberry Junior (David Cross), who wishes to build a parking garage in its stead. This upsets Ted, who suggests, to revive the museum's popularity, that they obtain a statue called the Lost Shrine of Zagawa. Mr. Bloomsberry is too old to go, but Ted quickly volunteers to make the expedition. Junior, frustrated, modifies his father's map of Africa to prevent Ted from finding the Shrine.
Ted is tricked into purchasing a yellow safari outfit with a yellow hat. In Africa, Ted leads a group on a four-day hike to the lost shrine. George spots the yellow hat and, mistaking it for a large banana, follows the group. They soon notice each other and become friends. When Ted reaches the end of Junior's sabotaged map, he encounters a miniature idol; believing this to be Zagawa itself, he gets depressed. He gets a call from Mr. Bloomsberry and sends a picture of the statue. However, the angle of the picture causes Mr. Bloomsberry to believe the idol is much bigger. Ted returns to the docks, while George quickly follows with the hat. George sneaks onto the ship and rides to the city without Ted's knowledge.
Upon arrival, Ted rides home in a taxi, and George follows him all the way to his apartment. Through a series of misadventures, Ted is evicted for violating a no-pets rule. Upset, Ted wonders what he is going to do with George. Together, they walk to the Bloomsberry Museum, where crowds of people await to see the idol. Junior overhears Ted complaining about the tiny idol and use this to humiliate Ted. George inadvertently destroys a dinosaur skeleton, and Junior shoves Ted out of the museum.
With nowhere to go, Ted and George sleep in a park. The next morning, Ted awakes to find George gone. Hearing a commotion, he follows it to a zoo, where he finds George with Maggie and her class. Ted attempts to court Maggie, but George starts floating away, suspended by a bunch of balloons, and Ted goes after him in the same way. Together, they fly around the city, held aloft by Ted's balloons and using a kite to control their direction. When they float over the Bloomsberry museum, Ted holds out the idol and wishes it were big, which gives him an idea.
Ted visits Clovis, an inventor who built the museum's Zagawa exhibit, who has a projection machine that can create a 40-foot-tall hologram of any object. Ted takes the projector to the museum, intending to use it to display the idol. He shows it to Mr. Bloomsbury, who agrees it would save the museum, but Junior sabotages the projector, framing George for it. Ted is forced to admit the truth to the thousands of people waiting outside, including Maggie, disappointing everyone. Angry at him, Ted allows George to be taken away by Animal Control officers and be shipped back to Africa. However, Ted's conscience convinces him that he has made a mistake or wronged his friend, as he confesses to Maggie.
Ted gets on the cargo ship and frees George. While he tries to explain to George that their friendship is more important than any idol, a beam of sunlight passes through the tiny statue, creating a pictogram showing the location of the full-size idol. Ted then realizes the true meaning of an ancient writing he saw back in Africa. Ted and George therefore travel to Africa in the ship's cargo bay, to rejoin Edu, Ted's guide, and find the true idol. Upon the exhibit's re-opening, the museum is redesigned to be more interactive, thereby igniting the children's interest in science and history. Ted and Maggie are about to become a couple in earnest when George again interrupts them by hijacking a nearby spacecraft.","banana,cheeky,joy,trust,feel good,humorous,kids,clever",2426.jpg,2006-02-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/curious-george/id335933357?uo=4,Pn0UtLssJnk,70175666,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Curious_George/70175666,"Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family"

7265,Damsels In Distress,"Violet and her two cohorts attempt to help their ""less-fortunate"" students at Seven Oaks College - primarily by running a Suicide Prevention Centre and offering their off-beat advice whenever they get a chance. Violet's newest rescue is transfer student, Lily, and Violet wants to teach her how to talk and dress properly, and how to select appropriate men to be interested in. Along their way in helping everybody at the college, the damsels teach the fraternity doofi to hit the books, they get their hearts broken, but then attempt to start an international dance craze.","The Movie: 1990s indie legend Whit Stillman returned after a lengthy absence as if nothing had changed, with his archly whimsical comedy about a gang of college girls (led by Greta Gerwig) who want to improve the lives of their peers.

Impact: Definitely a love-it-or-hate-it affair, but it underlined that Gerwig's presence extends beyond her mumblecore roots and also introduced a new dance craze: the sambola.

In the '90s, Whit Stillman was one of the US indie scene's bright young things, a chronicler of neurotic, narcissistic, upper-crust youth whose 1990 debut Metropolitan was an undoubted inspiration for the career of Wes Anderson. There's an odd, throwback quality to his present-day campus-com, where characters don't use cellphones or Facebook but do wear sweater sets and attend toga parties. But that's also what gives Damsels its quirky charm.

Stillman's damsels don't Tweet but they are twee, not least Violet (Greta Gerwig, superb), the movie's comically earnest queen bee. Her pretension matched only by her ignorance, Violet's college mission is to date frat boys beneath her social and intellectual status. She also likes to help clinically depressed fellow students, via the medium of choreographed dance routines. Like some do-gooder offshoot of Heathers, Gerwig and her colourfully attired posse wrangle innocent transfer student Lily (Crazy Stupid Love's Analeigh Tipton) into their screwball fold before she has time to protest.

Stillman's knack for subtle, acerbic humour and characters tarnished by their own flawed idiocy is still intact, even if some of his quirk factor now plays as overly self-conscious (there's a very weird discussion of anal sex).

And while he's never been one for iron-clad plotting, Damsels is especially rudderless, punctuated by batty observations and didactic arguments that spin off into tangents that don't make much sense.

Thirteen years is a long time, and Stillman's rustiness shows. Thankfully, he's still got a wicked way with words, and Gerwig gives off so much sparkle that we're prepared to grant Damsels a pass.

A mixed return for Stillman, Damsels is so whimsically out of step it's like a time-travel comedy without the time travel.  Fortunately, Gerwig and some dazzling dialogue save his blushes.

While trying to piece together his past, he stumbles upon a fiendish underworld controlled by a group of beings known as The Strangers who possess the ability to put people to sleep and alter the city and its inhabitants. Now Murdoch must find a way to stop them before they take control of his mind and destroy him. ","John Murdoch (Sewell) awakens in a hotel bathtub, suffering from amnesia. He receives a telephone call from Dr. Daniel Schreber (Sutherland), who urges him to flee the hotel from a group of men who are after him. During the telephone conversation, John discovers the corpse of a brutalized, ritualistically murdered woman, along with a bloody knife. Murdoch flees the scene, just as the group of men (known as the Strangers) arrive at the room. Eventually he learns his real name, and finds his wife Emma (Connelly). He is also sought by police inspector Frank Bumstead (Hurt) for a series of murders allegedly committed by Murdoch, who cannot remember killing anybody. While being pursued by the Strangers, Murdoch discovers that he has psychokinetic powers like them, and he uses these powers to escape from them. Murdoch moves about the city, which experiences perpetual night. He sees people become temporarily comatose at midnight, when the Strangers stop time and alter the cityscape, as well as people's identities and memories. Murdoch questions the dark urban environment, and discovers‚Äö√Ñ√Æthrough clues and interviews with his family‚Äö√Ñ√Æthat he was originally from a coastal town called Shell Beach. Attempts at finding a way out of the city to Shell Beach are hindered by lack of reliable information from everyone he meets. Meanwhile, the Strangers, disturbed by the presence of this human who also possesses psychokinetic powers, inject one of their men, Mr. Hand (O'Brien) with Murdoch's memories, in an attempt to find him.
Murdoch eventually finds Bumstead, who recognizes Murdoch's innocence and has his own questions about the nature of the dark city. They find and confront Dr. Schreber, who explains that the Strangers are endangered extraterrestrial parasites who use corpses as their hosts. Having a collective consciousness, the Strangers have been experimenting with humans to analyze their individuality in the hopes that some insight might be revealed that would help their race survive. Schreber reveals Murdoch as an anomaly who inadvertently awoke during one midnight process, when Schreber was in the middle of fashioning his identity as a murderer. The three men embark to find Shell Beach, which ultimately exists only as a billboard at the edge of the city. Frustrated, Murdoch tears through the wall, revealing a hole into outer space. The men are confronted by the Strangers, including Mr. Hand, who holds Emma hostage. In the ensuing fight, Bumstead, along with one of the Strangers, falls through the hole into space, revealing the city as an enormous space habitat surrounded by a force field.
The Strangers bring Murdoch to their home beneath the city and force Dr. Schreber to imprint Murdoch with their collective memory, believing Murdoch to be the final answer to their experiments. Schreber betrays them by inserting false memories in Murdoch which artificially reestablish his childhood as years spent training and honing his psychokinetic abilities and learning about the Strangers and their machines. Murdoch awakens, fully realizing his abilities, frees himself and battles with the Strangers, defeating their leader Mr. Book (Richardson) in a battle high above the city. After learning from Dr. Schreber that Emma's personality is gone and cannot be restored within her body, Murdoch utilizes his new-found powers through the Strangers' machine to create an actual Shell Beach by flooding the area within the force field with water and forming mountains and beaches. On his way to Shell Beach, Murdoch encounters Mr. Hand and informs him that the Strangers have been searching in the wrong place ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ the head ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ to understand humanity.

1597,Days of Thunder,"From the engine roar and fever pitch of professional stock car racing, Days of Thunder explodes with the most spectacular racing action ever captured on film. Tom Cruise plays race car driver Cole Trickle, whose talent and ambition are surpassed only by his burning need to win. Discovered by businessman Tim Daland (Randy Quaid), Cole is teamed with legendary crew chief and car-builder Harry Hogge (Academy Award¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫-winner Robert Duvall) to race for the Winston Cup at the Daytona 500. A fiery crash nearly ends Cole's career and he must turn to a beautiful doctor (Nicole Kidman) to regain his nerve and the true courage needed to race, to win and to live.","Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) is a young racer with years of experience in open-wheel racing. He is recruited by car dealership tycoon Tim Daland (Randy Quaid) to race for his team in the NASCAR Winston Cup Series. Daland also convinces former crew chief and car builder Harry Hogge (Robert Duvall) to come out of retirement and lead Cole's pit crew. During his first few races, Cole has difficulty adjusting to the larger NASCAR stock cars and communicating with his crew while being intimidated on the track by Winston Cup Champion Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker); this results in Cole not finishing the races, mostly due to crashes or engine blowouts. After discovering that Cole does not understand the common terminology used by NASCAR teams, Harry puts him in a series of rigorous training. This pays off at the Darlington race, when Cole uses a slingshot maneuver from the outside line to overtake Rowdy and win his first race.
The rivalry between Cole and Rowdy intensifies throughout the season until tragedy strikes. At the Firecracker 400 in Daytona, both drivers are seriously injured after their cars are destroyed by ""The Big One"". While recovering from his injuries in Daytona Beach, Cole develops a romantic relationship with Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), the neurosurgeon attending to his health. At the same time, Cole and Rowdy change from bitter rivals to close friends.
As Cole is still undergoing therapy, Daland hires hot shot rookie Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes) to take over his spot. Weeks later, Cole returns to active duty, with Daland now fielding two teams ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the second car driven by Russ. Though Cole shows signs of his old self, he finds himself intimidated by his own teammate. Then, at North Wilkesboro, Russ gets dirty on pit road and spins Cole out to win the race.

When Rowdy discovers that he has to undergo brain surgery to fix a broken blood vessel, he asks Cole to drive his car at the Daytona 500. Cole reluctantly agrees and convinces Harry to be his crew chief again. Hours prior to the race, Harry discovers that the car is leaking oil, so he manages to have Daland provide him a new engine. During the race, Cole's car suffers a malfunctioning gear shifter after being spun out by Russ, but the combined efforts of his pit crew, as well as those working for Daland, manage to fix the problem and get him back on the lead lap. This sets the tone for a final showdown between Cole and Russ. On the final lap, Russ predicts that Cole will attempt his signature slingshot maneuver from outside, but Cole tricks him with a crossover, overtaking him from the inside to win his first Daytona 500.
Cole drives into victory lane, where he celebrates with Claire and his pit-crew. As he looks around to see where Harry is, he spots him sitting alone on a concrete barrier near the pit stop.

2683,Dazed and Confused,"The end of the 1976 school year in a Texan small town is cause for celebration of the summer break. But first the Seniors are excited to chase the newbies, whom they may submit to merciless hazing, which for boys takes the stern-scorching form of no-nonsense spankings. However futile, attempts to escape are made, yet pointless for the members of the baseball team, which has to play that evening, before the partying, when alcohol is to anesthetize their seat-sting. Mitch Kramer becomes the prime prey after his stupid sister actually asks the boys to go easy on him, which only senior quarterback Randall ""Pink"" Floyd does, while senior year-repeater Fred O'Bannion adds frustration to his reputed zeal for spanking sorely sorry.","It is May 28, 1976, the last day of school at Lee High School in the suburbs of Austin, Texas. The next year's group of seniors are preparing for the annual hazing of incoming freshmen. Randall ""Pink"" Floyd, the school's star football player, is asked to sign a pledge promising not to take drugs during the summer or do anything that would ""jeopardize the goal of a championship season"". When classes end, the incoming freshman boys are hunted down by the seniors and paddled. The incoming freshman girls are also hazed; they are rounded up in the school parking lot by senior girls, covered in mustard, ketchup, flour and raw eggs, and forced to propose to senior boys.
Freshman Mitch Kramer escapes the hazing with his best friend Carl Burnett when Carl's mom pulls a shotgun on flunking-thus-repeating senior Fred O'Bannion, but he is later cornered at his baseball game, and violently paddled. O'Bannion, a senior participating in the hazing tradition for a second year after failing to graduate, delights in punishing Mitch. Pink gives the injured Mitch a ride home and offers to take him cruising with friends that night. Plans for the evening are ruined when Kevin Pickford's parents discover he planned to host a keg party. Elsewhere, the intellectual trio of Cynthia Dunn, Tony Olson and Mike Newhouse decide to participate in the evening's activities. Pink and his friend David Wooderson, a young adult who still socializes with high school students, pick up Mitch and head for the Emporium, a pool hall popular frequented by teenagers.
As the evening progresses, students loiter around the Emporium, listen to rock music, cruise the neighborhood and stop at the hamburger drive-in. Mitch is introduced to sophomore Julie Simms, with whom he shares a mutual attraction. While cruising again with Pink, Kevin, and Don Dawson, Mitch drinks beer and smokes marijuana for the first time. They play mailbox baseball, but a neighborhood resident brandishing a gun threatens to call the police. They barely escape after the resident fires at their car. After returning to the Emporium, Mitch runs into his middle school friends. They hatch a plan to get revenge on O'Bannion. The plan culminates with them dumping paint on O'Bannion and him leaving in a fit of rage.
After the Emporium closes, an impromptu keg party is planned in a field under a moonlight tower. Cynthia, Tony and Mike arrive at their first keg party. Mike is threatened by tough guy Clint Bruno. Tony runs into freshman Sabrina Davis, whom he met earlier during the hazing. They begin hanging out together. Cynthia likes Wooderson and exchanges phone numbers with him. Mike, suffering from the humiliation of his confrontation with Clint, decides to make a stand, punches him, and gets tackled. The fight is broken up by Pink and Wooderson. Football player Benny O'Donnell confronts Pink about his refusal to sign the pledge. Pink, the only player not to have signed, believes it violates his individuality and beliefs. Mitch leaves the keg party with Julie. They drive to a nearby hill overlooking town to make out. Tony gives Sabrina a ride home and they kiss good night.
As night turns to dawn, Pink, Wooderson, Don, and several friends including Ron Slater and Simone Kerr decide to smoke marijuana on the 50-yard line of the football field. The police arrive, so they ditch the drugs. Recognizing Pink, the police call football Coach Conrad. Conrad lectures Pink about hanging out with ""losers"" and insists that he sign the pledge. Pink says that he might play football, but he is not going to sign the pledge. Pink leaves with his friends to get tickets to an Aerosmith concert. Mitch arrives home after sunrise to find his mother has waited up for him. She decides against punishment but warns him about coming home late again. Mitch goes to his bedroom, puts on headphones and listens to ""Slow Ride"" by Foghat as Pink, Wooderson, Ron and Simone travel down a highway to purchase their tickets.",,2683.jpg,1993-09-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dazed-and-confused/id379802600?uo=4,,70003553,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Dazed_and_Confused/70003553,Comedy
1086,Dead Again,"Oscar nominee Kenneth Branagh (Henry V) and Oscar winner Emma Thompson (Howards End*) give dazzling dual-role performances in this supernatural-tinged romantic murder mystery. Mike Church (Branagh) is a L.A. gumshoe with a knack for tossing off wisecracks and tracking down missing persons. But Church doesn't have a clue when he's hired to help a beautiful amnesia victim (Thompson) tormented by blood-curdling nightmares. Then an eccentric antiques dealer and hypnotist (Derek Jacobi) leads Church to a startling discovery: The source of the nightmares may lie in a past-life connection to Margaret Strauss, a world-famous pianist allegedly murdered by her composer husband... in 1948. In the classic tradition of Spellbound and Rebecca, Dead Again ""brings an entertaining genre back to life"" (Tom Jacobs, Los Angeles Daily News). Costarring Andy Garcia.","Mike Church (also Branagh) is a smart-alecky Los Angeles private investigator whose job often involves tracing debt defaulters and locating missing people. He is called upon by Father Timothy (Richard Easton), the priest in charge of the orphanage where Mike was raised, to help identify a woman (Emma Thompson) who has appeared in a state of shock, unable to speak, and with amnesia.
Church takes the woman, whom he calls Grace, to his apartment to stay, and discovers she is terrified of scissors. The two uncover clues to her identity but nothing concrete. ""Grace"" regains her voice during a past life regression session with Franklyn Madsen (Derek Jacobi), an antique dealer who claims she is having a past life experience. Under hypnosis, she recalls a couple who lived during the 1940s, a famous composer and his pianist wife, as if she were part of their history. Madsen finds a LIFE magazine identifying the couple as actual people, Roman and Margaret. Margaret was brutally murdered, and Roman was executed for her murder.
As Mike and ""Grace"" fall in love, Grace is upset by the similarities of their courtship to that of Roman and Margaret. She becomes afraid of Mike and is unconvinced by his assertions that he's ""not Roman."" Madsenn hypnotizes Mike, leading to the revelation that Mike is the reincarnation not of Roman, but of Margaret. Now, Mike becomes afraid of Grace. Mike consults with Cozy Carlisle (Robin Williams), a disgraced psychiatrist who has lost his license and now works in a butcher shop. Grace consults with Madsen; each is advised to kill the other. Meanwhile, Mike's friend at the newspaper, Pete Dugan (Wayne Knight), uncovers Grace's true identity: she is Amanda Sharpe, an artist. Dugan takes her and Madsen to her apartment, where she discovers she is an artist who is obsessed with scissors. Madsen gives her an antique gun from his shop.
Mike finds Baker, now old and frail, at a nursing home. Baker no longer believes Roman killed Margaret but says that the housekeeper, Inga, would know. After the murder, Inga moved out and opened an antiques shop run by her son, Frankie, a disturbed boy with a stutter whom Margaret had accused of stealing. Mike then visits Inga (Hanna Schygulla), who explains that it was Frankie who killed Margaret. Inga had long been in love with Roman, and had saved his life as they fled war-torn Europe. After Margaret and Roman married, Inga had been treated coldly. Baker, attracted to Margaret, had made her suspicious that Roman had killed his first wife and was having a sexual affair with Inga. Roman loyally refused to fire Inga, despite Margaret's pleading, which made her even more suspicious. Unhappy about her treatment, Inga complained Frankie, who responded by killing Margaret with scissors. On hearing Inga's story, Mike, realizing that Franklyn Madsen is Frankie, races to Amanda's apartment; Frankie, meanwhile, arrives at the shop and murders his mother by smothering her.
Mike breaks into Amanda's apartment. She shoots him as he is trying to tell her the truth about Roman and Margaret. Frankie arrives. Amanda now tries to shoot him also, but this time the gun misfires. Frankie slaps her unconscious and prepares to shoot her (in the mouth, so that it will look like suicide), but Mike rouses himself and stabs Frankie with scissors (which Frankie had placed in his hand to incriminate him). Pete arrives with a pizza and tries to stop Mike, thinking he is trying to kill Amanda ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ but quickly realizes it is Frankie who is the killer (and who now has hold of Mike's gun). After a brief standoff, Amanda stabs Frankie in the back with the scissors. Enraged, Frankie (whose stutter has returned) removes the scissors and lunges at her and Mike. Mike moves a sculpture of giant scissors directly into his path, impaling him. The scene changes to one of Roman and Margaret kissing; this scene fills with color and fades to a shot of Mike and Amanda kissing.","mind bending,stylized,suspenseful,atmospheric,tense",1086.jpg,1991-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dead-again/id300978535?uo=4,vVt2h_UMnr0,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Romance"

3576,Dead Poets Society,"In an age defined by crew cuts, sport coats, and cheerless conformity, he not only broke the mold ... he reinvented it. Academy Award¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫ winner Robin Williams (Best Supporting Actor, GOOD WILL HUNTING, 1997) delivers an extraordinary performance in one of the most compelling motion pictures of all time. Williams stars as English professor John Keating, a passionate iconoclast who changes his students' lives forever when he challenges them to live life to the fullest and ""Carpe Diem"" -- seize the day! Keating's unconventional approach meets with irrepressible enthusiasm from his students, but the faculty at staid, exclusive Welton Academy prep school is, to put it mildly, not amused.","Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero), and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston) are senior students of the Welton Academy, an elite prep school, whose ethos is defined by the headmaster Gale Nolan (Norman Lloyd) as ""tradition, honor, discipline and excellence"".
The teaching methods of their new English teacher, John Keating (Robin Williams), are unorthodox by Welton standards, whistling the 1812 Overture and taking them out of the classroom to focus on the idea of carpe diem. He tells the students that they may call him ""O Captain! My Captain!,"" in reference to a Walt Whitman poem, if they feel daring. In another class, Keating has Neil read the introduction to their poetry textbook, prescribing a mathematical formula to rate the quality of poetry which Keating finds ridiculous, and he instructs his pupils to rip the introduction out of their books, to the amazement of one of his colleagues. Later he has the students stand on his desk in order to look at the world in a different way. The boys discover that Keating was a former student at Welton and decide to secretly revive the school literary club, the ""Dead Poets Society"", to which Keating had belonged, meeting in a cave off the school grounds.
Due to self-consciousness, Todd fails to complete a writing assignment and Keating takes him through an exercise in self-expression, realizing the potential he possesses. Charlie publishes an unauthorized article in the school newspaper, asserting that girls should be admitted to Welton. At the resulting school inquiry, he offers a phone call from God in support, incurring the headmaster's wrath. After being lectured by Headmaster Nolan about his teaching methods, Keating tells the boys to ""be wise, not stupid"" about protesting against the system.
Knox meets and falls in love with a girl named Chris, using his new-found love of poetry to woo her. He presents one of these poems in class, and is applauded by Keating for writing a heartfelt poem on love. Knox travels to Chris' public school and recites his poem to her, later convincing her to go to a play with him. Neil wants to be an actor but knows his father (Kurtwood Smith) will disapprove. Without his father's knowledge, he auditions for the role of Puck in a production of A Midsummer Night's Dream. His father finds out and orders Neil to withdraw. Neil asks Keating for advice and is advised to talk to his father and make him understand how he feels, but Neil cannot muster the courage to do so. Instead he goes against his father's wishes. His father shows up at the end of the play, furious. He takes Neil home and tells him that he intends to enroll him in a military school to prepare him for Harvard University and a career in medicine. Unable to cope with the future that awaits him or to make his father understand his feelings, Neil commits suicide.
At the request of Neil's parents, the headmaster launches an investigation. Cameron meets the school governors and board of regents. Later, confronted by Charlie, Cameron admits that he squealed on them and made Keating the scapegoat, and urges the rest of them to let Keating take the fall. Charlie punches Cameron and is later expelled. Todd is called to Nolan's office, where his parents are waiting. Nolan forces Todd to admit to being a member of the Dead Poets Society, and makes him sign a document blaming Keating for abusing his authority, inciting the boys to restart the club, and encouraging Neil to flout his father's wishes. Todd sees the other boys' signatures already on the document, and is threatened by his father to sign it. Keating is subsequently fired.
The boys return to English class, now being taught by Nolan, who instructs the boys to read the introductory essay only to find that they had all ripped it out. Keating enters the room to retrieve a few belongings. Todd reveals that the boys were intimidated into signing the denunciation. Nolan orders Todd to be quiet and demands that Keating leave. As Keating is about to exit, Todd for the first time breaks his reserve, calls out ""O Captain! My Captain!"" and stands on his desk. Nolan warns Todd to sit down or face expulsion. Much of the class, including Knox, Meeks, and Pitts, climb onto their desks and look to Keating, ignoring Nolan's orders until he gives up. Keating leaves visibly touched.","individual,uplifting,joy,challenge the status quo,captivating,sieze the day,status quo,captain my captain,stand out,anticipation,sentimental,boys school,sincere,trust,believe in yourself,make a stand,challenge,emotional,touching,think for yourself,contemplative,be different,carpe diem,bittersweet,private school",3576.jpg,1989-06-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dead-poets-society/id206329496?uo=4,wrBk780aOis,,,Drama
3599,Dead Presidents,On the streets they call cash dead presidents. And that's just what a Vietnam veteran (Larenz Tate) is after when he returns home from the war only to find himself drawn into a life of crime. With the aid of his fellow vets he plans the ultimate heist -- a daring robbery of an armored car filled with unmarked U.S. currency!,"In the spring of 1969, Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate) is about to graduate from high school. However, Anthony is not going to college, but needing to get away from home to find himself, he enlists in the U.S. Marine Corps shortly after graduation. He is sent to Vietnam, leaving behind his middle-class family, a pregnant girlfriend (Rose Jackson), and small time crook Kirby (Keith David), who is like a second father.
Anthony's close friend Skip (Chris Tucker) later joins Curtis's squad after flunking out of college, and Jose (Freddy Rodriguez) is drafted into the Army. Once in the Marines, Curtis meets gung-ho lieutenant Dugan (Jaimz Woolvett), and his wartime friend, Cleon (Bokeem Woodbine), a religious yet deadly staff sergeant. During their tour in Vietnam as members of a Force Recon unit, they experience the horrors of war, losing several fellow Marines during combat. The Marines (especially Cleon) also commit atrocities, including executing enemy prisoners and beheading corpses for war trophies. One of their squad, D'Ambrosio (Michael Imperioli), is the victim of the North Vietnamese, and is disemboweled and castrated. While waiting for medivac, Anthony, succumbing to the request of the dying D'Ambrosio, gives the man a fatal dose of morphine. One of their squad is killed by stepping on a land mine and a night ambush ensues, with NVA troops and half of Anthony's team killed; Dugan is killed after Skip ""freezes up"" during the gunfight when he is ordered to cover him. Cleon manages to hold off the enemy long enough for Anthony and the last of the crew to escape.
When Anthony returns to The Bronx in 1973, after four years of service and presumably multiple combat tours in Vietnam, attaining the rank of sergeant, he finds returning to ""normal"" life is impossible. He finds his friend Skip, who used drugs during the war, is now a heroin addict. Jose, after serving as a demolitions expert, during which he lost his hand, has become a pyromaniac. Cleon is now a devoted minister. And Kirby has since become legitimate due to police cracking down on his criminal business. Anthony is laid off from his job in a butcher shop and finds himself unable to support his daughter. During a pool game at Kirby's, Cowboy (Terrence Howard) makes fun of Anthony and informs him that Cutty (Clifton Powell) was having sex with his girlfriend Juanita while he was deployed in Vietnam. Anthony then beats Cowboy with a pool stick out of rage. Anthony pesters Juanita into admitting to sleeping with Cutty to provide for their daughter. Anthony meets his girlfriend's sister Delilah (N'Bushe Wright), a member of the ""Nat Turner Cadre"", a fictional group similar to black revolutionaries. Delilah has always had a crush on Anthony and decides to help him with a plot he devises. Anthony, Kirby, Skip, Jose, Delilah and Cleon plan to rob an armored car making a stop at the Noble Street Federal Reserve Bank of the Bronx.
Skip and Cleon act as lookouts, Kirby is the getaway driver, Delilah waits in a dumpster across the street, and Anthony and Jose hide under the loading docks, all armed. Though they plan the heist very carefully, it goes horribly wrong when a policeman stumbles on the scene. The policeman interferes, talking to Cleon. Cleon says he's waiting for a city bus. The officer thinks it's odd since it's way too early for any buses coming and decides to check the bus schedule for Cleon. Anthony and Jose decide to ambush the armed guards. But the driver sees the two coming out armed, from his rear-view mirror. As soon as he alerts his fellow officers, Anthony holds one officer at gunpoint, while Jose grabs one bag stack with money and officers begin shooting at Jose. Jose hide behind cover. Another officer is about to shoot Anthony, but Delilah hops out of the dumpster and screams while she shoots the officer dead. This distracting Anthony, the officer tries to knock the shotgun out of Anthony's hands. They struggle for the gun, and Anthony headbutts the officer and pistol whips him, wounding him severely.
The officer talking to Cleon, hears all the commotion and takes out his gun. This results in Kirby hopping out the car and shooting at the officer, but, Kirby is shot in the arm, and Skip comes up behind the officer and shoots him in the head, killing him. Jose quickly grabs a detonator, an explosive device, and hops on the moving truck, with the driver trying to leave the scene. Kirby gets in his car and blocks the truck's entry. Kirby quickly hops out the car and runs as Jose places the explosive device in the back of the van. Jose jumps off and the truck driver slams into Kirby's car and Jose detonates the bomb, blowing up the truck, killing the driver and burning much of the cash. Anthony, Skip, Kirby and Cleon are furious that Jose burned most of the money, but quickly manage to grab over $300,000. The explosion attracts more officers and as one is about to shoot Anthony Delilah shoots and misses him and the officer shoots her dead. In a fury of rage, Anthony shoots him and then beats to death the officer that he had pistol whipped earlier when he revives and reaches for his gun. The remaining crew splits up, as Jose runs in an alleyway with the cash, a police cruiser chases him. Jose kills the driver, but the officer in the passenger seat uses the dead officer to drive into Jose against a brick wall killing him.
Anthony decides that Jose's cut goes to his wife Marisol and their kids and Delilah's cut goes to the poor children on Christmas. Kirby wants to kill Cleon before he gets arrested and rats them out. Anthony, who wants no more bloodshed, tells Kirby, he'll take care of it but Cleon (after being arrested) gives up the other thieves as part of a plea bargain. NYPD officers storm Skip's apartment to find that he has died of a heroin overdose. As Kirby and Anthony prepare to leave the country police show up, and Kirby tells Anthony to run, fighting off the officers with the pool sticks, but Anthony is cornered and he surrenders.
In court, Anthony is tried, convicted, and sent to prison for 15 years to life. Anthony berates the judge (Martin Sheen), a war veteran himself, who goes so far as to call him a disgrace to any person who put on uniform and served his country. Upon receiving his sentence, Anthony gets angry and throws a chair at the judge. The films ends as Anthony boards a prison bus.","rough,suspenseful,captivating,tense",3599.jpg,1995-10-04, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dead-presidents/id442606067?uo=4,,,,Drama

2572,Dear Jack,"Using The DV camera originally enlisted to capture the making of his album, Andrew shot everything before and after the crucial day in May of 2005 when he both finished his record and was diagnosed with cancer. Dear Jack opens on the day of his diagnosis and continues on through the life-changing and deeply personal events that followed. The film also includes flashes back to Andrew's childhood and the making of the first Jack's Mannequin album, as well as rare live footage and the chronicling of his relationships with two very important people in his life, his sister and her best friend.","Chronicles McMahon on a roller-coaster year, through the highs of recording and releasing the first Jack's Mannequin album and the lows of being diagnosed with leukemia and breaking up with the love of his life. Using a DV camera Sire Records bought him to capture the making of his album, Andrew shot everything before and after that crucial day in May of 2005 when he both finished the project and was diagnosed with cancer. The documentary is a raw look at the battle that is leukemia, from spinal taps to radiation, from using a lint brush to remove your hair to infusing your body with someone else's stem cells (in this case, Andrew's sister Kate, coincidently on the exact date his album was released). The film opens on the day Andrew is diagnosed and follows him through every scary, life-changing and intensely personal event that follows. It also flashes back to his childhood, the making of the Jack's Mannequin album and his collaboration with Lee, one of the last concerts he played before becoming ill, and his relationships with the two most crucial women in his life, his sister and her best friend. ""Dear Jack"" is a breathtakingly emotional film, as well as a testament to family, friends and, perhaps more than anyone will ever know, a love of making music.

3587,Death Becomes Her,"Helen, a writer, and Madeline, an actress, have hated each other for years. Madeline is married to Ernest, who was once Helen's fiance. After she recovers from a mental breakdown, Helen vows revenge by stealing back Ernest and plotting to kill Madeline. Both rivals have secretly drunk a miracle cure for aging; they accidentally discover, when each tries to eliminate the other, that they have become immortal and that ""life"" will never be the same again.","In 1978, the narcissistic, manipulative actress Madeline Ashton (Meryl Streep) performs in ""Songbird""‚Äö√Ñ√Æan ill-conceived musical version of Sweet Bird of Youth by Tennessee Williams‚Äö√Ñ√Æon Broadway. Following her performance, Madeline invites her long-time rival Helen Sharp (Goldie Hawn), an aspiring writer, backstage, along with her fianc‚àö¬©, plastic surgeon Ernest Menville (Bruce Willis). Ernest is visibly smitten with Madeline, which worries Helen, who has lost other men to Madeline in the past. Although Ernest reassures Helen there is nothing going on between him and Madeline, he soon breaks off his engagement with Helen and weds Madeline. Seven years later, Helen has been committed to a psychiatric hospital after becoming fixated upon Madeline. Obese and depressed, Helen is encouraged to ""erase [Madeline] from [her] mind"" in order to move on. Helen feigns rehabilitation and is released, all the while plotting revenge on Madeline.
After an additional seven years, Madeline continues to live well financially in Beverly Hills with Ernest, but the two are miserable in their marriage. Madeline's career is all but over, and Ernest is an alcoholic reduced to working only as a reconstructive mortician. Following the receipt of an invitation to a party later that evening celebrating Helen's new book, Madeline rushes to a spa where she regularly receives extensive facial treatments. Understanding the urgency of Madeline's situation, the spa owner gives her the business card of Lisle von Rhoman, a woman who specializes in beauty and youth rejuvenation. Madeline dismisses the spa owner's advice and returns home to prepare for the party.
Madeline and Ernest attend the book-signing party for Helen's novel Forever Young and discover that Helen is now thin and youthful looking. Dumbfounded and depressed by Helen's new appearance, Madeline goes to see her young lover but discovers he is spending the evening with a woman his own age. Dejected, Madeline re-discovers Lisle's business card and drives to her home. There, Lisle (Isabella Rossellini) is revealed as a mysterious, wealthy socialite who appears to be in her thirties. However, Lisle discloses her true age as 71, and reveals to Madeline the secret of her beauty: a potion that promises eternal life and an ever-lasting youthful appearance. Madeline purchases and drinks the potion and is returned to her youthful form. However, as a condition of purchase, Madeline must disappear from public life after ten years in order to keep the existence of the potion a secret. Lisle also warns Madeline to take good care of her body.
Meanwhile, Helen has seduced Ernest and convinced him to kill Madeline, intending to drug her and fake a drunk-driving accident, which will then free Ernest from Madeline and allow him to wed Helen. However, when Madeline returns home (now appearing young and beautiful), she and Ernest have an argument, during which Madeline falls down the stairs and breaks her neck. Believing Madeline to be dead, Ernest phones Helen for advice, not noticing as Madeline slowly stands and approaches him with her head now twisted backwards. Horrified, Ernest assumes that she has a seriously dislocated neck and drives her to the emergency room. After losing consciousness in the emergency room, Madeline is taken to the morgue due to her body having no pulse and a temperature below 80¬¨‚àûF. After rescuing Madeline, Ernest takes the sign of her ""resurrection"" as a miracle, returns home with Madeline and uses all his skills to repair the damage to her body.
Helen later arrives at her mansion, demanding information about Madeline's situation. Overhearing Helen and Ernest re-discussing their earlier plot to stage Madeline's death as an accident, Madeline confronts Helen and then shoots her with a double-barreled shotgun. However, although the blast causes a gaping basketball-sized hole in her stomach, Helen does not die. She and Madeline both realize they drank the same potion. The pair scheme to have Ernest also drink the potion in order to to ensure he is available to maintain their bodies.
After bringing Ernest to Lisle, she makes an impassioned argument for immortality and offers to give him the potion free of charge. Ernest refuses, stating he'd rather live his own life and die rather than spend an eternity with only Madeline and Helen for company and no way to escape. He pockets the potion and attempts to flee, but during his escape becomes trapped on the roof. After slipping and becoming stuck on a rain gutter, held up only by his suspenders, Helen and Madeline implore Ernest to drink the potion in order to survive the impending fall. Ernest refuses, drops the potion, and seemingly falls to his death. However, Ernest survives the fall, crashing through a glass skylight and landing in Lisle's pool, and escapes. After Lisle effectively excommunicates Madeline and Helen from her group, the pair realize they must now rely on each other for companionship and maintenance for the remainder of their ""lives"".
Thirty-seven years later, Madeline and Helen attend Ernest's funeral, where he is eulogized as having lived an adventurous and fulfilling life. The two bicker as they leave Ernest's funeral, upon which it is revealed they are now horrifying mutations of their former selves, with cracked, peeling paint and putty now covering most of their grey and rotting flesh. While walking, Helen accidentally trips on a can of spray paint Madeline had earlier dropped, leaving her precariously teetering at the top of a staircase. After deliberately hesitating to help her companion, Helen grabs Madeline and the two tumble down the stairs, literally breaking to pieces as they crash to the bottom. As their disembodied heads roll and totter together, Helen sardonically asks Madeline, ""Do you remember where you parked the car?""","disembodied head,plastic surgeon,revenge,friends who hate each other,immortality,mortician,disfigurement,joy,rival,witty,vanity,affair,betrayal,eternal youth,magic potion,falling down stairs,immortal,potion,macabre,vengeance,seduction,anticipation,offbeat,1990s,murder,cynical,love triangle,death,witchcraft,humorous,afterlife,black comedy,head spin,broken neck,extramarital,husband wife relationship,eternal life,biting,occult,shovel,actress,clever,surprise,plastic surgery,fear",3587.jpg,1992-07-31, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/death-becomes-her/id325427184?uo=4,B7sMilQeVHk,,,"Comedy,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
1197,Death Proof,"In Austin, Texas, girlfriends Julia Lucai, Arlene, Shanna and Lanna Frank meet in a bar to drink, smoke and make out with their boyfriends before traveling alone to Lake LBJ to spend the weekend together. They meet the former Hollywood stunt man, Mike, who takes Pam out in his ""death-proof"" stunt car. Pam soon discovers Mike's secret. Fourteen months later, Mike turns up in Lebanon, Tennessee. Abernathy ""Abbie"" works in the make-up department on a film set. Zo‚àö¬¥ Bell, Kim and Lee are all chased by him but the girls are tough and decide to pay-back the attack.","Three friends: Arlene (Vanessa Ferlito), Shanna (Jordan Ladd), and radio DJ ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Jungle‚Äö√Ñ√π Julia Lucai (Sydney Tamiia Poitier) -‚Äö√Ñ√¨ drive down Congress Avenue in Austin, Texas, on their way to celebrate Jungle Julia's birthday. While bar-crawling, Julia reveals that she made a radio announcement earlier that morning, offering a free lap dance from Arlene in return for addressing her as ""Butterfly,"" buying her a drink, and reciting a segment of the poem ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening.‚Äö√Ñ√π They are unaware they are being stalked by an aging and sadistic Hollywood stunt double, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Stuntman‚Äö√Ñ√π Mike (Kurt Russell). After trailing them to a bar, Mike follows the instructions from the radio announcement to get the lap-dance. Despite some initial trepidation, due to having seen Mike's car earlier in the day, and asking if he has been following them, Mike puts her at ease (partly by saying she's chicken), impresses her with his smooth talk, and Arlene agrees to the dance.
The three women prepare to depart with their friend Lena, whom they picked up in the bar, while Pam (Rose McGowan), another intoxicated female bar patron, has been impressed by Mike and accepts a ride home from him, considering him to be a teetotaler and a safe ride. Mike takes Pam to his matte black 1971 Chevy Nova SS 396, which is a stunt car rigged with a safety cage inside, confirming that his car is ""death proof"". As Mike drives Pam off, it becomes clear he is trying to kill her, reminding her that his car is ""death proof"", but only to the driver. Since the passenger side has no safety restraints at all, he kills her by driving recklessly and then slamming on the brakes, which smashes her skull into the dashboard. Mike speeds off, leaving behind photos he took earlier of the three other women, so as not to get caught with any evidence. He eventually comes on their red 1997 Honda Civic Hatchback on an empty road, and drives at full speed directly into it. The force of the impact kills all four women, and also covers up the real reason of Pam's death. (There was another woman driver in the car known as Lena Frank, whom they met up with earlier at the bar.)
The local hospital finds Mike with only minor injuries (broken collar bone and smashed index finger), and asserts that since Mike was sober while the four women were intoxicated, he cannot be charged. This concerns Texas Ranger Earl McGraw (Michael Parks), who is convinced Mike is guilty but cannot investigate without evidence. Though he chooses not to pursue a long, drawn out investigation, McGraw tells his son (who also happens to be his deputy) that should Stuntman Mike try this again, McGraw will 'make damn sure he don't do it in Texas'.
Fourteen months later, three young women, Abernathy Ross (Rosario Dawson), Kim Mathis (Tracie Thoms), and Lee Montgomery (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), are traveling through Lebanon, Tennessee in their customized yellow 1969 Ford Mustang Mach 1. They stop briefly at a convenience store, where Mike is resting in his new ride, a 1969 Dodge Charger R/T 500, and is intrigued by the women. The women, unaware of Mike, pick up their friend, stuntwoman Zo‚àö¬¥ Bell (who is playing herself), from the airport. Zoe informs them she wants to test-drive a white 1970 Dodge Challenger R/T, exactly the same type of car from the 1971 film, Vanishing Point, which just happens to be nearby. After they get to the car's location, Abernathy tries to convince the owner, Jasper, to let them ""test drive"" it alone. He refuses at first, but after Abernathy tells him Lee will stay behind (under the false pretense that they are in town to film a porno, of which Lee is the star), he agrees.
In the process of all this, Zoe reveals to Abernathy and Kim that she has an ulterior motive in taking the car; she wants to play a game called ""Ship's Mast"", where she rides on the car's hood using only leather belts to hold onto, while Kim drives it at high speeds. Kim is hesitant, but then agrees to do the stunt. As Kim drives, Zoe goes on the top of the car, while Kim accelerates. The trio enjoys the stunt, unaware that Mike is watching them from the hood of his car. While they are driving, Abernathy notices him too late, and he rear-ends them, causing Zoe to drop one of their belts. He continues to ram down the car, intending to kill Zoe. After few collisions, he T-bones them, causing Zoe to drop. He leaves the car, smiling about the events, but Kim shoots him. He escapes. Abernathy and Kim cry over the loss of their friend, but Zoe shows up, not injured at all (she is a professional stuntwoman). They all agree to catch Mike and beat him, and Zoe takes a piece of pipe and rides shotgun, before giving chase.
Meanwhile, Mike has stopped in a small narrow road to treat his wound with a whiskey. He drinks it and pours it on his injured arm, screaming in pain. As he tries to calm himself down and to have a drink, he suddenly notices them in a rear window, but too late, as they collide with him. Zoe gets out and beats him with the pipe before he makes his getaway. Zoe gets in and they give chase against him, crashing with him on the mountain road. Mike tries to overrun them couple of times to escape, even apologizing to them and saying that it is a prank, but the girls don't listen to him. The chase escalates when they end up on a highway, where Mike colides with some traffic cars to slow them down. He eventually manages to push them on a side road, escaping. However, he is unaware that the side road is parallel to the road on which he is driving; they merge back and T-bone him, causing him to spin out, breaking his right arm. They pull him out and give him a severe beating, until Zoe gives him a roundhouse kick to his head, smashing his skull, killing him.","exciting,scary,cynical,suspenseful,humorous,rough,fear",1197.jpg,2007-05-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/death-proof/id306979516?uo=4,rX0mnnt_giQ,,,"Action & Adventure,Horror,Mystery & Suspense"

831,Death Wish,"In this explosive story of revenge and urban violence, Charles Bronson plays Paul Kersey, a bleeding-heart liberal who has a change of opinion after his wife and daughter are violently attacked by a gang of thugs in their apartment. His daughter is sexually assaulted and his wife is murdered. Bronson then turns vigilante as he stalks the mean streets of New York on the prowl for muggers, hoodlums and the like. Death Wish is a violent, controversial film that is frank and original in its treatment of urban crime and the average citizen's helplessness in dealing with it. Herbie Hancock wrote the musical score. And watch for a young Jeff Goldblum in his film debut as one of the thugs.","Paul Kersey (Charles Bronson) and his wife Joanna (Hope Lange) vacation in Hawaii. They return to New York City, where Paul works as an architect.
Joanna and their daughter Carol Anne (Kathleen Tolan) shop for groceries at D'Agostino's Market. Three bloodthirsty hooligans (one played by Jeff Goldblum in his first movie appearance) are creating havoc in the local grocery store. They catch Joanna's address after she asks that her groceries be delivered. They follow her to the apartment, burst in and trash the apartment. They search for money but find only $7. The hooligans then rape Carol and savagely beat Joanna, escaping scot-free.
Paul's son-in-law Jack Toby (Steven Keats) calls to tell him only that Joanna and Carol are in the hospital. After waiting impatiently, Paul is told by a doctor that his daughter is OK and that she was sedated and put to bed, but Paul is also informed that his wife has died. Devastated, he is told by police that the likelihood of catching the criminals is small.
The next day, Paul's boss gives him an extended business vacation to Tucson, Arizona to meet a client, Ames Jainchill (Stuart Margolin), who shows him the ropes. Paul witnesses a mock gunfight at Old Tucson, a reconstructed Western frontier town used as a movie set. At a gun club, Ames is impressed when Paul shoots with near bulls-eye accuracy. Paul reveals that he was a ""CO"" (conscientious objector) during the Korean War who served his country as a combat medic. Paul had been taught to handle firearms at a young age by his father, but after his father was killed in a hunting accident Paul decided to forswear the use of firearms for any purpose. After Paul makes substantial improvements to Ames' plans for a residential development, a thoroughly pleased Ames drops him at the airport, slipping a little going-away present into Paul's bag.
Back in Manhattan, his daughter is catatonic. Paul opens his suitcase and discovers that Ames' ""going-away present"" is a nickel-plated .32 Colt Police Positive revolver. He pockets the gun and takes a stroll. Paul encounters a mugger, an ex-convict named Thomas Leroy Marston who attempts to rob him at gunpoint with a .38 Smith & Wesson Model 36 revolver. Paul shoots him with the revolver, killing him.
Shocked that he just killed a human being, Paul runs home and throws up. But his vigilantism continues the following night, when he guns down three more men (one of whom is Denzel Washington also making his screen debut) who are robbing a defenseless old man in a vacant alley.
A few nights later, two muggers see Paul on a subway. They attempt to rob him at knife-point but Paul shoots them both with the revolver.
The next scene has Paul then sitting in a sleazy Times Square coffee shop surrounded by prostitutes and assorted street people. He pays his bill to the cashier purposely revealing a wallet full of cash. He leaves followed by two thugs who have taken the bait. Yet again a robbery attempt is made. Paul shoots one but the other manages to stab him in his shoulder. As a wounded Paul stumbles off, the one who stabbed him gets away mortally wounded, dying at a hospital.
NYPD Lt. Frank Ochoa (Vincent Gardenia) investigates the vigilante killings. His department narrows a list to men who have had a family member recently killed by muggers and who are war veterans. The public, meanwhile, is happy that somebody is doing something about crime.
Ochoa soon suspects Paul. He is about to make an arrest when the District Attorney (Fred J. Scollay) intervenes and tells Ochoa to ""let him loose"" in another city instead. Ochoa doesn't like the idea, but relents.
Paul shoots two more muggers before being wounded by a third mugger with a M1911A1 pistol at a warehouse. His gun is discovered by a young patrolman (Christopher Guest) who hands it to Ochoa, who tells him to forget that he ever saw it and additionally tells the press that the wounded Paul is just another mugging victim. Hospitalized, Paul is ordered by Ochoa to leave New York, permanently. Paul replies, ""By sundown?""
Paul arrives in Chicago Union Station by train. Being greeted by a company representative, he notices a group of hoodlums harassing a young woman. He excuses himself and helps the woman. The hoodlums make obscene gestures, but Paul points his right hand like a gun and smiles, suggesting that his vigilantism will continue.","rough,suspenseful,disturbing",831.jpg,1974-07-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/death-wish/id285933286?uo=4,_GieK_55uyY,,,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Drama"

With no hopes of ever joining a family, they form their own familial bonds. Then the unexpected news comes that a young couple may adopt one of them, and the long-time pals suddenly share something else: a rivalry to be the chosen one. December Boys, a poignant memoir of friendship and family, marks Daniel Radcliffe‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s first major film role outside the Harry Potter series. He plays Maps, a big brother to the group as it stumbles and wavers its way toward manhood. Join the boys for their remarkable journey of the heart called growing up.","This film is a coming of age picture for the four main characters, and how their lives can change over one holiday. The film is set in 1960s Australia. Four orphan boys from a Roman Catholic orphanage in the outback of Australia - Maps, Misty, Spark and Spit - were all born in the month of December, and for their birthday, they are sent on a holiday to the beach to stay with Mr. and Mrs. McAnsh. While there, they meet Fearless, a man who claims to be the risk motorbike rider in the nearby carnival, and his wife, Teresa. Misty, Spark and Spit instantly become closer to Teresa, but Maps, the eldest of the four, is still reluctant to talk to her. He instead finds more fun in spending time with a teenage girl named Lucy, who had come to the beach to stay with her uncle. He often goes up to a place with strange rocks, and meets her there.
A few days later, the orphans peek through a window in Fearless' house to see Teresa undressing, but Misty, being the most religious of the four, throws a rock at the wall to make them go away. Misty runs back to Mr. McAnsh's house and looks through the small opening of a door to see someone in the shower, only to find that it is the sickly body of Mrs. McAnsh. They soon realise that she has breast cancer.
One night, Misty overhears Fearless talking to his friends about the possibility of adopting one of the orphans. Excited about the opportunity to finally have parents, he keeps it to himself until he decides to reveal it to a priest who has driven to the beach for the orphans' confessions. The other boys realise that he is taking too long, and once he is finished, they force it out of him with the threat of Spit spitting on him while he is pinned to the ground. Misty, Spark and Spit are eager to compete for the love of the seemingly perfect Fearless and Teresa, but Maps is less than excited, even saying to Lucy, ""What's the big deal about parents, anyway?"" Maps experiences his first kiss with Lucy, and soon loses his virginity to her in one of the caves of the Remarkable Rocks.
There, she tells him to promise that he will always remember her as his first. The next day, he goes up to the Remarkable Rocks, only to realise that Lucy is not there. Her uncle tells him that she's left the beach to return to her father, and will not be back until next summer. Heartbroken, he goes to the carnival to find Fearless and talk to him, but discovers that he is not a motorbike rider there, and instead cleans up after the animals. Furious that he'd lied all along, he finds a painting made by Misty of him as the son of Fearless and Teresa, and destroys it. Misty attacks him and hits him with the fragments of the frame he'd put the painting in, and the bond between the four orphans is broken.
Fearless finds Maps in the cave of the Remarkable Rocks, and explains to him what had really happened. It is revealed to the audience that Fearless was formerly a bike rider, and did all of the stunts with Teresa riding in the back. Then, there was an accident that kept Teresa in the hospital for nearly a year, making her unable to have children. That was the reason they had wanted to adopt one of the orphans.
Maps returns to the beach and finds out from Spark and Spit that Misty had gone into the water, and was drowning. Maps goes after him despite the fact that he cannot swim. Both he and Misty nearly drown. Underwater, they open their eyes to see a vision of the Virgin Mary, possibly meaning that they are dying. Before they can reach out to it, the two boys are grabbed by Fearless and brought back to the shore. Maps and Misty reconcile with each other and the four are friends again.
The next day, the boys are called to Fearless' and Teresa's house for an announcement. There, they reveal the couple is going to adopt Misty. He take leave of his friends and he watches on the front porch with Fearless and Teresa as the three orphans leave and begin playing on some of the rocks. Misty realises that they were his true family all along, and asks Fearless and Teresa if he can stay with them instead. They accept, and he returns home with the orphans.
Several decades later, Misty, as an old man, drives to the same beach with Spark and Spit, along with the ashes of Maps, who had died as a priest in Africa helping refugees, and Lucy's ring that she gave to him. They let the ashes loose in the wind, remembering their time there.","bittersweet,touching,sentimental",3846.jpg,2007-09,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/december-boys/id273701815?uo=4 ,OZ4-soyzzNw,,,"Drama,Kids & Family"

309,"Definitely, Maybe","Romantic comedy: Will Hayes, a 30-something Manhattan dad is in the midst of a divorce when his 10 year old daughter, Maya, starts to question him about his life before marriage. Maya wants to know absolutely everything about how her parents met and fell in love. Will's story begins in 1992, as a young, starry-eyed aspiring politician who moves to New York from Wisconsin in order to work on the Clinton campaign. For Maya, Will relives his past as a idealistic young man learning the ins and outs of big city politics, and recounts the history of his romantic relationships with three very different women. On the campaign, Will's best buddy is Russell McCormack. They not only have similar political aspirations, they share the same type of girl problems, too. Will hopelessly attempts a ""PG"" version of his story for his daughter ad changes the names so Maya has to guess who he finally married. Is her mother Will's college sweetheart, the dependable girl next-door Emily? Is she his longtime best friend and confidante, the apolitical April? Or is she the free-spirited but ambitious journalist? As Maya puts together the pieces of her dad's romantic puzzle, she begins to understand that love is not so simple or easy. And as Will tells her his tale, Maya helps him to understand that it's definitely never too late to go back...and maybe even possible to find a happy ending.","Will Hayes (Ryan Reynolds) is a 38-year-old father who is in the midst of a divorce. After her first sex-ed class, his 10-year-old daughter Maya (Abigail Breslin) insists on hearing the story of how her parents met. Will gives in, but decides to change the names and some of the facts relating to the various love affairs of his youth, thereby creating a love mystery; Maya is left guessing which of the women will turn out to be her mother. The story he tells Maya is depicted in long flashbacks. From time to time the film switches back to the present, where Maya comments (often disdainfully) and asks questions.
The story begins in 1992 when Will, a starry-eyed aspiring political operative, moves away from Wisconsin and his college sweetheart, Emily (Elizabeth Banks) to New York City, where he works on the Clinton campaign. Over the years, Will becomes involved with three women who enter and re-enter his life, including Summer Hartley (Rachel Weisz) an aspiring journalist, and April (Isla Fisher) the copy girl for the campaign. Will and April have a chance meeting outside work, where Will reveals he is going to propose to Emily. When Will practices his proposal to Emily on April, she is taken aback by Will's heartfelt words, and replies, ""Definitely, maybe."" They go back to her apartment, where April has multiple copies of Jane Eyre in her collection, explaining that her father gave her a copy with an inscription in the front shortly before he died, and the book was later lost. She has spent years looking through copies of Jane Eyre at secondhand stores hoping to find the copy her father gave her, but she buys any copy she finds that has inscription. They suddenly kiss, but Will backs away and leaves.
Emily comes back to New York where she confesses, just after Will proposes, that she slept with his roommate. She did it on purpose to break up with Will, saying that she is ""letting him go"" because she doesn't share his rather lofty aspirations. After Clinton is elected, Will opens a campaigning business with most of his work colleagues, which enjoys a good amount of success.
Before Will left Wisconsin, Emily asked Will to deliver a package to her former roommate, Summer Hartley, who is living in New York City. Will first meets Summer when he gives her the package, a diary that she wrote when she was a teenager (which, among other things, tells of a brief affair with Emily). He finds she is going out with a famous writer who is old enough to be her father. However, the writer breaks up with Summer and Will starts a relationship with her. Meanwhile, April quits her job and goes to travel around the world. Will plans to propose to Summer when April comes back to tell him she loves him. However, she sees Will's intentions and reluctantly congratulates him instead. Summer writes a derogatory article about one of Will's clients, which causes the end of her relationship with Will. As a result of the article, Will loses his business and his dream of a political career goes down the drain.
April calls after a long while and finds that Will is unemployed and unhappy. She throws a birthday party for him where he is reunited with his old colleagues. In a drunken rant, Will confesses his romantic feelings for April, but in the process ends up having a fight with her, questioning why she works in a used book store and telling her to ""go to life rehab."" Some time later, while walking the streets Will passes a used book store and sees the copy of Jane Eyre with the inscription from April's father. Will goes to April's apartment to give her the book, but he decides against it when he meets her live-in boyfriend Kevin.
Emily re-enters Will's life when she moves to New York City, and turns out to be Maya's mother and Will's ex-wife, as Maya correctly guesses. Will explains to Maya that his story had a happy ending, which was Maya. Will and Maya share a hug and part ways as Maya leaves with her mother. At home, Will finds the book he has been saving for April, and goes to the offices of Amnesty International, where April is now working. After learning that April is now single again, Will gives her the book. But, when April finds out that Will had been holding on to the book for years, she becomes upset and asks him to leave.
Maya is happy that she figured out the story, but also realizes that her father still loves April, as even though Will changed the names of Emily (Sarah in real life), and Summer (Natasha in real life), he did not change April's name. Encouraged by Maya, they go to April's apartment, where Will confesses to April that he held on to the copy of Jane Eyre because it was the only thing he had left of her. As the three enter into April's building, April springs into Will's arms and kisses him.",joy,309.jpg,2008-02-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/definitely-maybe/id281009584?uo=4,LMpLWf5tv30,70075478,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Definitely_Maybe/70075478,"Comedy,Romance"

3059,Despicable Me,"In a happy suburban neighborhood surrounded by white picket fences with flowering rose bushes, sits a black house with a dead lawn. Unbeknownst to the neighbors, hidden beneath this home is a vast secret hideout. Surrounded by a small army of minions, we discover Gru, planning the biggest heist in the history of the world. He is going to steal the moon. (Yes, the moon!) Gru delights in all things wicked. Armed with his arsenal of shrink rays, freeze rays, and battle-ready vehicles for land and air, he vanquishes all who stand in his way. Until the day he encounters the immense will of three little orphaned girls who look at him and see something that no one else has ever seen: a potential Dad. The world's greatest villain has just met his greatest challenge: three little girls named Margo, Edith and Agnes. ","A mysterious criminal mastermind has stolen one of the pyramids in Egypt, sparking a fit of jealous envy in evil genius Gru (Steve Carell), who hasn't managed to make headlines since he and his minions swiped the Times Square JumboTron years back. Ever since Gru was a little boy, he dreamed of going to the moon. Now, if Gru can just build a rocket and get his hands on a powerful shrink-ray, he can cement his reputation as the greatest thief who ever lived by stealing the Earth's satellite right out of the sky. But immediately after Gru heists the shrink-ray, the cunning super-nerd Vector (Jason Segel) swoops in and snatches it right out of his hands. Now, in order to claim the moon, Gru must first reacquire the weapon from Vector. Armed with the knowledge that his nemesis has a mean sweet tooth, Gru adopts cookie-selling orphans Margo (Miranda Cosgrove), Agnes (Elsie Fisher), and Edith (Dana Gaier) and commissions a new line of cookie robots from the evil Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand), his personal weapons specialist. But as Gru and his diminutive yellow minions prepare to carry out the biggest heist in history, something strange happens. Gru discovers that the three little girls who have come into his life are much more than simple pawns. They actually seem to care about Gru, and it turns out the scheming evildoer makes a pretty good father.

1823,Detroit Rock City,"Edward Furlong (American History X, Terminator 2: Judgment Day) and Natasha Lyonne (American Pie) star in this lively, hard-rocking coming-of-age comedy about four boys desperate to attend a KISS concert in Detroit.","The movie opens in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1978. Hawk (Edward Furlong), Lex (Giuseppe Andrews), Trip (James DeBello), and Jam (Sam Huntington) are four rebellious teenagers who emulate and tribute KISS to a degree in their own garage band called ""Mystery."" Having discovered his secret cache of KISS albums, Jam's ultra-conservative and religiously hysterical mother, Mrs. Bruce (Lin Shaye), races up to the home and drags Jam to the car, throwing Jam's Love Gun album into a trash can.
The three remaining boys discover the next morning that their KISS concert tickets are missing, figuring that Trip's jacket carrying the tickets got swapped with Jam's. Jam is not able to retrieve the tickets from his jacket before school due to his mother watching over him as he dresses. Jam's mother later discovers the tickets and destroys them in front of Jam and the others, by setting them on fire.
Mrs. Bruce then drags Jam from his school and has him transferred to a Catholic boarding school. While in tech class, the three remaining boys hear a radio contest for KISS concert tickets at Cobo Hall that night.[3] Trip leaves class, so he can call the contest line and he ends up winning the tickets. The boys then ditch school to bust Jam out of the Catholic school. They take Lex's mom's car, a Volvo 200 series. The trio arrives and Hawk disguises himself as an arriving pizza delivery guy and delivers a pizza ordered by the priest, Father McNulty (Joe Flaherty) who is currently lecturing Jam, that has been spiked with hallucinogenic psilocybin mushrooms. Father McNulty becomes high, allowing them to whisk Jam away.
On the freeway, a Solar Gold 1978 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, driven by Kenny (Nick Scotti) and Bobby (David Quane), two Italian-American Disco fanatics, along with their girlfriends Christine (Natasha Lyonne) and Barbara (Emmanuelle Chriqui), begins tailgating them. Trip accidentally drops some pizza on his lap and throws the slice of pizza out of the window, where it hits the windshield of the Trans-Am, causing a dispute that results in the enraged Kenny pulling Hawk out of the car and rubbing his face in the pizza on the windshield. Their bullying upsets Christine, who argues with them and leaves, walking down the freeway. The boys then pick up Christine walking along the highway, who decides to accompany them to Detroit.
Upon arrival, they find out that Trip did not stay on the phone long enough to give the radio station his information, forcing the station to give the tickets to the next caller. When coming back outside, Lex notices that the car has been stolen, and they suspect Christine, who they left sleeping in the car.Hawk then states that the boys go their separate ways in order to find KISS tickets, and agree to meet in the same place later.
Hawk finds a scalper (Richard Hillman) who suggests that he enter a strip contest at a nearby stip club to raise money for tickets. Hawk does just that, although he gets extremely drunk beforehand. He doesn't win, but is offered payment for his company by Amanda Finch, an amorous older woman present (Shannon Tweed). They go to her car and she takes his virginity. Afterwards, Hawk declines the money she offered, but she insists, telling him to use it for whatever he wanted to begin with. As Hawk locates the scalper again, however, he runs off, indicating he's all sold out, much to Hawk's dismay.
Trip goes to a local convenience store in the hopes of mugging a younger child to get tickets. He grabs a kid (Cody Jones) in Ace Frehley makeup, but the kid has an older brother, Chongo (Matthew G. Taylor), a giant jock athlete who, with his gang of thugs, threaten to beat him up unless Trip pay them $200.00 for their trouble. Asking them to wait outside, Trip illogically plans to rob the convenience store with a fake gun (in reality a Stretch Armstrong toy) against his better judgement, but ends up thwarting a real robbery attempt at the store, earning him a $150.00 reward and a passionate kiss from the lady cashier (Kristin Booth). Trip meets the thugs in an alleyway behind the store, but the kid decides that Trip didn't meet their demands and has Chango punch Trip in the stomach while taking his wallet.
Lex sneaks into the backstage area with the KISS loading crew to help set up the concert, but is soon discovered and found, causing him to flee from arena security and manages to get to the area where the band's trailer is located. Lex is eventually caught and tossed over a fence by the guards. At first he is menaced by a group of vicious dogs, but earns their trust when he plays frisbee with them. In a nearby building he finds a chained-up Christine and his car in a chop shop with two workers (Kevin Corrigan and Steve Schirripa) who plan to rape her. Lex then uses his newly befriended dogs to chase the two thugs into a back office room, saving Christine and his mom's car. Lex and Christine share a passionate kiss.
Jam encounters his mother who is leading an anti-KISS rally. The furious Mrs. Bruce grabs him and drags him to a church across the street for confession, taking away his drumsticks. He is seen by Beth (Melanie Lynskey), a girl from his school who is in the presence of moving with her parents. She rushes into the church and into the confessional booth where Jam is, finally revealing to him that she's been in love with him since freshman year, but never had the courage to tell him. Jam and Beth then make love right then and there, losing their virginity to one another before the priest returns. Beth promises to contact him once she and her family are settled. Jam, now imbued with new confidence, goes back to the rally to take a stand. Jam finally stands up for himself, getting revenge at his mother for her controlling and domineering ways by yelling at her before the assembled crowd, telling her that forcing religion and morality down his throat are the reasons that he has been rebelling lately, that she has been so blindsided by her fanaticism she's forgotten what's really important, making her a lousy parent. Jam then demands that she return his drumsticks, only receiving one of them as the other is broken in the trash.
When the boys meet up again, none of them have had any luck getting tickets, so in a last-ditch effort, Jam suggests that they beat each other up and say that muggers took their tickets. They do so, unleashing all their angers and frustrations out on one another and, upon arrival at the concert, they tell the guards that they were mugged by four people. The guards do not believe them, but suddenly Trip points out to the guards the kid, Chongo and the thugs from the store, who are just entering the concert hall. The guards finds Trip's wallet (with his KISS Army picture ID and the $150.00 he got as reward for thwarting the robbery) in their pockets, and hand him the tickets, ejecting the others outside.
Astonished and elated, the boys enter the concert hall and KISS plays the title song of the movie, ""Detroit Rock City"". Jam catches a drum stick thrown by drummer Peter Criss as the film ends.[4]","humorous,feel good",1823.jpg,1999-08-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/detroit-rock-city/id293111183?uo=4,Uri6ajeP2hg,22038548,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Detroit_Rock_City/22038548,Comedy
3445,Devil,"Five strangers trapped in an elevator realize that one of them is the Devil in this thriller from director John E. Dowdle (Quarantine) and screenwriter Brian Nelson (Hard Candy, 30 Days of Night). The first installment of ""The Night Chronicles,"" a film series in which up-and-coming filmmakers bring to life stories conceived by M. Night Shyamalan, Devil opens to find five Philadelphia office workers filing into the elevator of an inner-city office building. But a typical day at the office takes a sudden detour into terror when the elevator becomes stuck between floors, and the passengers discover that the Devil does exist, and he's standing right before them. As emergency workers work frantically to free them, secrets are revealed and the passengers realize their only hope for survival is to confront their darkest sins in front of the others. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","Ramirez (Jacob Vargas) speaks in a voice-over about stories that his mother told him about the Devil sometimes actively seeking out individuals who have sinned, while they're still alive on Earth. While taking human form, he traps them in a confined place only to turn them against each other, before killing them one at a time. Ramirez explains that the last victim will die in front of his or her loved one to make cynics of them all, and in the end, all will die. He says that the signs are set in motion with a suicide, as that is when the Devil first makes his presence known. This story is abruptly interrupted by a violent suicide of a man who had fallen from the thirty-fifth floor of a Philadelphia office building; the truck he landed on rolls silently away from the scene.
Detective Bowden (Chris Messina) is a recovering alcoholic who is assigned to the case of the suicide. He later explains that the reason for his alcoholism was the hit and run death of his wife, and toddler son, five years prior, in which the perpetrator was never apprehended, leaving behind only a coupon ticket for a car wash with the words ""I'm so sorry"" written on the back. When he investigates the suicide, he determines that the truck originated from an office building down the block from where the victim was found. Meanwhile, five strangers board an elevator, which becomes stuck between floors just shortly after starting up to the upper floors. When security finds them, they notice that there is CCTV and a radio with which they can call into the elevator, but they have no way of hearing the passengers in return. Bowden takes the investigation regarding the elevator as it is the same building from which the suicide victim jumped.
Ramirez is revealed to be one of the security guards and is disturbed by an image of what looks like a screaming face frozen on the video monitor that flashes away. His boss Lustig (Matt Craven) dismisses the superstitious suspicions and sends repair technician Dwight (Joe Cobden) to investigate the elevators while Bowden tries to ascertain the identities of the individuals. Only four of the five are accounted for: Vince McCormick (Geoffrey Arend), a sleazy mattress salesman known for investments and frauds; Sarah Caraway (Bojana Novakovic), the wife of a rich man who is a pathological liar and plans to leave her husband and take his money; Ben Larson (Bokeem Woodbine), a temporary security guard with a history of violence, who is in only his second day on the job; Jane Kowski (Jenny O'Hara), an older woman who is seen on video to be a thief, and another man who later introduces himself as Tony (Logan Marshall-Green), who does not appear to have signed in at the security desk.
The power goes out in the elevator and the lights start flashing. When they come on, Sarah appears to be wounded with what appears to be a bitemark. All suspicion is initially focused on Vince who has been edgy since the ride began. The lights start flashing and losing power, Sarah becomes queasy and sees a vision of everyone around her in the elevator slaughtered on the floor, even herself. There is another power failure and when the lights are back to focus, Vince is seen dead, thrown into the mirror only to have his jugular vein sliced. The others watch in horror as he dies, forcing Bowden to consider this a murder scene. Dwight attempts to rappel down the elevator shaft via a pulley to try to fix the elevator, but Ramirez says that the Devil will stop any attempts to help his victims, and Dwight's strap comes loose when he is knocked over by a flock of pigeons and plummets to the roof of the elevator, killing him and further scaring the people. The power goes out again and screams are heard from everyone. When it comes back, Jane is found hanging from the ceiling from a light cable, dead, causing both Sarah and Ben to accuse Tony while Tony swears his innocence. Tony then releases her from the cables that hang her from the ceiling, causing her body to fall to the floor.
Lustig goes to investigate the power in the basement and there finds a loose power cable that appears to be the cause of the elevator malfunction, but he is viciously electrocuted trying to fix the issue. Meanwhile in a men's room adjacent to the main lobby, Bowden finds a set of tools that Tony had brought in and briefly suspects he might be responsible for sabotaging the elevator. His suspicions then turn to Ben when he realizes that the building's security company, Caraway Security, is owned by Sarah's husband. Aware of Ben's violent past, he becomes convinced that Ben was hired to kill Sarah by her husband to keep her from leaving him broke, and that the two other murders were orchestrated to make the entire episode appear as a random serial killing. However Ben himself becomes the victim of the next blackout, when he winds up on the floor with his neck twisted around grotesquely, leaving the police further horrified and baffled.
The two remaining survivors, Sarah and Tony, face off with each other, but lower their weapons after Detective Bowden calms them down over the loudspeaker. Then there is another blackout and Sarah's throat is cut. As she stuggles to breathe in Tony's arms, a woman claiming to be Tony's fiancee is brought before Bowden and informs him that Tony's last name is ""Janekowski"", and that he is in the building for a job interview, thus eliminating the possibility of the old woman's name being Jane Kowski.
As they realize this, the dead body of the old woman rises up behind Tony, pupils dilated and revealing herself to be Satan himself. Tony tries to bargain with her to save Sarah's life and sacrifice his own; she scoffs at this, revealing that she's going to kill him anyway. In a last, desperate plea for forgiveness, Tony, using a radio, confesses to a hit and run five years earlier: while drunkenly reaching for beer in his car, he smashed into another car and killed a woman and her child. He says over the radio that he is ""so sorry"" and Bowden realizes that Tony was the one who killed his family (based on the car wash ticket). Bowden realizes that Ramirez was right about him having been meant to be the audience to this.
The Devil, powerless now that Tony has repented of his sin, curses before vanishing, and the elevator comes back on line, leaving Tony's life spared. Bowden offers to take Tony into custody for the confession, and while en route, informs him who he is. But despite saying he'd gone over what he'd say, or what he would do if they'd ever cross paths, he forgives Tony.
Ramirez, again in a voice-over, says that his mother always reassured him at the end of her stories, ""If the Devil is real, then God must be real too.""","scary,suspenseful",3445.jpg, ,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/devil/id396826065?uo=4 ,bITfOdMmRY8,,,"Horror,Mystery & Suspense"

2408,Dial M for Murder,"When American writer Mark Halliday visits the very married Margot Wendice in London, he unknowingly sets off a chain of blackmail and murder. After sensing Margot's affections for Halliday, her husband, Tony Wendice, fears divorce and disinheritance, and plots her death. Knowing former school chum Captain Lesgate is involved in illegal activities, Tony blackmails him into conspiring to kill Margot. When she kills Lesgate in self-defense, Tony implicates her as being guilty of premeditated murder. Halliday must out-stratagize Tony to save Margot's live.","Tony Wendice is an ex-professional tennis player who lives in a London flat with his wealthy wife Margot. Tony retired after Margot complained about his busy schedule, and she began an affair with American crime-fiction writer Mark Halliday, which Tony secretly discovered. Motivated by resentment, jealousy, and greed, Tony devises a plan to have Margot murdered.
When Mark visits England, Margot introduces him to Tony as a casual acquaintance. After sending the two lovers out for the evening, Tony makes an excuse to meet at the flat with petty criminal C.A. Swann, an old acquaintance from Cambridge. Tony has been following Swann in order to blackmail him into committing the murder. Tony tells Swann of Margot's affair, including a love letter from Mark which she once kept in her handbag. Six months ago, Tony stole the handbag and anonymously blackmailed her. After tricking Swann into leaving his fingerprints on the letter, Tony offers to pay him ¬¨¬£1,000 to kill Margot. If he refuses, Tony will turn him in to the police as the blackmailer.
When Swann agrees, Tony explains his plan. He will take Mark to a party, leaving Margot at home and hiding her latchkey under the carpet on the staircase outside the front door of the flat. Swann is to sneak into the flat after Margot goes to bed and hide behind the curtains in front of the French doors leading to the garden. When Tony telephones from the party at 11 p.m., Margot will go to the phone. Swann is to kill her from behind, open the French doors, and leave signs suggesting a burglary gone wrong, then exit through the front door, again hiding the key under the staircase carpet.
The plan works until Tony phones the flat later than intended, as his watch has stopped. Swann, about to give up waiting, has already put the key back under the staircase carpet when the phone rings. He tries to strangle Margot with a scarf, but she defends herself with a pair of scissors, killing him. She then picks up the telephone receiver and pleads for help. Realizing the plan has gone wrong, Tony tells her not to do anything. At home, he calls the police and sends Margot to bed. Then he moves what he assumes is Margot's latchkey from Swann's pocket into her handbag, plants Mark's letter on Swann, and replaces Swann's scarf with one of Margot's stockings. He also persuades Margot to hide the fact that he told her not to call the police.
The next day, Chief Inspector Hubbard questions the Wendices and Margot makes several conflicting statements. When Hubbard explains that Swann must have entered through the front door, Tony falsely claims to have seen Swann after Margot's handbag was stolen and suggests that Swann made a copy of her key. Hubbard does not believe that story because no key was found on Swann. Hubbard arrests Margot after concluding that she killed Swann for blackmailing her with Mark's letter when he came to collect. Margot is found guilty and sentenced to death for murder.
On the day before her scheduled execution, Mark tries to persuade Tony to save her by telling the police that he hired Swann to kill her. Tony refuses, insisting the story is too unrealistic, just before Hubbard arrives. With Mark hiding in the bedroom, Hubbard asks Tony about money he has been spending lately, tricks him into revealing that his latchkey is in his raincoat, and asks him about an attach‚àö¬© case. Tony claims to have lost the case, but Mark notices it on the bed, full of cash. Realizing that the story he thought he had invented is true, Mark stops Hubbard from leaving and explains his theory. Hubbard claims to prefer Tony's story that Margot gathered the money to pay Swann before deciding to kill him, but after Mark leaves, Hubbard discreetly swaps his own raincoat with Tony's, and as soon as Tony has left, he uses Tony's key to re-enter the flat. He really does suspect Tony, having discovered that the key in Margot's handbag was Swann's.
Mark returns after seeing Tony leave. Meanwhile, on Hubbard's orders, police officers release Margot. She tries to unlock the door with the key in her purse, then enters through the garden, proving she is unaware of the hidden key. Hubbard has the handbag returned to the police station, where Tony retrieves it after discovering that he has no key. When he is unable to unlock the front door with the key from the bag, he takes Margot's key from the staircase and opens the door, proving his guilt. With his escape routes blocked by Hubbard and another policeman, Tony makes himself a drink.",,2408.jpg,1954-05-29, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dial-m-for-murder/id271878319?uo=4,,60001804,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Dial_M_for_Murder/60001804,"Classics,Mystery & Suspense"

Dirt holds and cleans our water. Dirt heals us and makes us beautiful. Dirt regulates the earth's climate. Why do we humans ignore, abuse, and destroy our most precious living natural resource? Consider the results of such behavior: Mass starvation, drought, floods and global warming. Narrated by Jamie Lee Curtis, DIRT! THE MOVIE tells the story of humans trying to reconnect to dirt - the living skin of the earth. Traveling from the vineyards of California to the plains of Kenya, DIRT! reveals how repairing our relationship with dirt can create new possibilities for all life on earth.","A look at man's relationship with Dirt. Dirt and humans couldn't be closer. We started our journey together as stardust, swirled by cosmic forces into our galaxy, solar system, and planet. We are made of the same stuff. Four billion years of evolution created dirt as the living source of all life on Earth including humans. Dirt has given us food, shelter, fuel, medicine, ceramics, flowers, cosmetics and color --everything needed for our survival. For most of the last ten thousand years we humans understood our intimate bond with dirt and the rest of nature. We took care of the soils that took care of us. But, over time, we lost that connection. Our species became greedy and careless. We still depend on dirt, but now we abuse and ignore it.

3474,Dirty Dancing,"The summer of 1963 innocent 17-year-old Baby (Grey) vacations with her parents at a Catskill's resort. One evening she is drawn to the staff quarters by stirring music. There she meets Johnny, the hotel dance instructor, who is as experienced as Baby is naive. Baby soon becomes Johnny's pupil in dance and love.","In the summer of 1963, 17-year-old New Yorker Frances ""Baby"" Houseman (Grey) is vacationing with her affluent family at Kellerman's,[6] a resort in the Catskill Mountains. Baby is planning to attend Mount Holyoke College to study the economics of underdeveloped countries and then enter the Peace Corps. She was named after Frances Perkins, the first woman in the U.S. Cabinet. Her father, Dr. Jake Houseman (Orbach), is the personal physician of Max Kellerman (Jack Weston), the resort's owner.
Baby develops a crush on the resort's dance instructor Johnny Castle (Swayze), leader of the working-class entertainment staff. While carrying a watermelon for Billy (Johnny Castle's cousin), Baby is invited to one of the staff's secret after-hours parties and observes the ""dirty dancing"" (i.e., the Mambo) for the first time. She is intrigued by the sexy dancing, and receives a brief, impromptu lesson from Johnny. Later, Baby discovers that Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Rhodes), is pregnant by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter who dates (and cheats on) Baby's sister Lisa. Baby learns that Robbie plans to do nothing about the pregnancy (as he says, ""some people count, some people don't""), so Baby secures the money from her father to pay for Penny's illegal abortion. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby despite her secrecy regarding what it will be used for, because of the trust Jake has always held in her. In her efforts to help, Baby also becomes Penny's substitute dancer for an important performance at the Sheldrake, a nearby resort where Johnny and Penny perform annually. The upcoming show requires Johnny to train Baby to learn the required routine.
As Johnny teaches Baby to dance, tempers flare and a romance begins to develop. Their performance at the Sheldrake goes reasonably well, though Baby is too nervous to accomplish the dance's climactic lift.
When they return to Kellerman's, they learn that Penny's backstreet abortion was botched, leaving her in agonizing pain. Baby brings her father to help, but he misinterprets Johnny's answer to a question he asked while treating Penny, and thus believes it is Johnny who impregnated her. For that reason, after Jake saves Penny's life, he forbids Baby to have anything to do with Johnny or his friends. Jake is furious at Baby for lying to him and betraying his trust. Baby, however, defies him and sneaks out to visit Johnny in his room that same night, where they consummate their blossoming romance with some intimate dancing.


An iconic scene from the dancing finale[7][8]
Johnny and Baby's relationship is eventually revealed after Johnny is accused of stealing a wallet from one of the resort guests and is unable to provide a verifiable alibi. To save Johnny from being fired, Baby confesses that Johnny could not have been responsible, as she was with him in his cabin that night. While Johnny is cleared of the theft, Max still fires Johnny for violating the ban on having affairs with guests. Baby's selfless act inspires Johnny to realize that ""there are people willing to stand up for other people no matter what it costs them.""[9]
At the final talent show of the season, Jake gives Robbie a check to help defray the costs of medical school. Robbie then willingly confesses to getting Penny pregnant and insults her in the process, leading Jake to angrily snatch the envelope back. Also, to everyone's surprise, although Johnny's been fired and left the premises, he returns to the resort to perform the final dance of the season with Baby. Criticizing the Housemans for their choice of Baby's seat at the table, Johnny declares the now-famous line, ""Nobody puts Baby in a corner,"" as he pulls her up from their table. He leads her onstage, interrupting the show which is already in progress. After Johnny makes a brief speech about how ""Frances"" has made him a better man, he and Baby dazzle the audience with a stunning dance performance to the song ""(I've Had) The Time of My Life"", which ends with Baby doing the lift successfully for the first time.
After the dance, Jake apologizes to Johnny and admits that he was wrong to assume Johnny had gotten Penny ""in trouble"". Jake also praises Baby for her dancing. The film ends as the dance sequence continues and the room is transformed into a nightclub, where everyone (staff and guests) dances together.","sentimental,corner,sincere,joy,trust,captivating,love,sexy,time of my life,swan dive,touching,no body puts baby in the corner,feel good,baby,anticipation",3474.jpg,1987-05-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dirty-dancing/id217821076?uo=4,QIyhfZw_WYI,445386,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Dirty_Dancing/445386,"Drama,Musical & Performing Arts,Romance"
7175,Disconnect,"A drama centered on a group of people searching for human connections in today's wired world.

Jason Bateman, Hope Davis, Frank Grillo","The Internet has dramatically changed the world. That much we know. Our lives are better for it, on balance. But it's the other side of that scale, the harm caused by our web-connected lives, that is the weighty focus of ""Disconnect."" The damage that can be done, intentionally or not, has been well-documented. Writer Andrew Stern and director Henry Alex Rubin have selected several examples of the Internet age's unfortunate downside and crafted three compelling story lines, all based on actual cases. This common narrative structure will inevitably be called ""Crash-like,"" but whether or not the stories connect isn't really the point of ""Disconnect."" The movie raises a danger sign that, if gone unheeded, will only result in more senseless tragedies -- countless lives ruined, innocent children lost -- and putting the spotlight on several unsuspecting victims of our Internet society makes for a powerful experience that packs an emotional wallop from opening credits to finale.

This is one of those films for which, as a non-spoiler reviewer, it's best for me to avoid the specifics of the script and who does what here. You'll have to discover that for yourself. But, needless to say, Disconnect is not the feel-good movie of the year. It's often sad and scary, dark and depressing at times, and knowing it's based on true stories makes it all the more devastating when we witness the consequences of our seemingly-innocuous actions when entering a chat room, looking for virtual companionship, playing a childish practical joke, or putting our personal information online.",,7175.jpg,2013-04-12,,,70258410,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Disconnect/70258410,Drama
1308,District 9,"In 1982, a massive star ship bearing a bedraggled alien population, nicknamed ""The Prawns,"" appeared over Johannesburg, South Africa. Twenty-eight years later, the initial welcome by the human population has faded. The refugee camp where the aliens were located has deteriorated into a militarized ghetto called District 9, where they are confined and exploited in squalor. In 2010, the munitions corporation, Multi-National United, is contracted to forcibly evict the population with operative Wikus van der Merwe in charge. In this operation, Wikus is exposed to a strange alien chemical and must rely on the help of his only two new 'Prawn' friends.","In 1982, a large alien spacecraft stops directly above Johannesburg in South Africa. An investigation team enters the ship, discovering a population of sick and malnourished extraterrestrials. The aliens, derogatorily referred to as ""prawns"", are confined to District 9, a government camp just outside Johannesburg. Periodic unrest then occurs between the aliens and the locals and subsequently the South African government hires Multinational United (MNU), a private military company, to relocate the aliens to a new internment camp.
In August 2010, Wikus van de Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an Afrikaner bureaucrat, is appointed by Piet Smit (Louis Minnaar), an MNU executive and his father-in-law, to lead the camp relocation by serving the aliens with eviction notices. Meanwhile, three aliens ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ Christopher Johnson (Jason Cope), his son, and a friend ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ search for alien technology, from which they distill a mysterious fluid, storing it in a small canister. While raiding the shack of Christopher's friend, Wikus discovers and seizes the canister, which sprays the fluid onto his face. Christopher's friend is subsequently killed by Koobus Venter (David James), a xenophobic soldier leading the military side of the operation.
The fluid slowly begins mutating Wikus into a prawn, beginning with his arm. MNU forces Wikus to test various alien weapons which only function when alien DNA is present. The MNU scientists then decide to vivisect Wikus, but Wikus overpowers his captors and escapes. Smit orders Venter and his men to hunt down Wikus, while a story is released to the media stating that Wikus is infected with an alien STD.
Wikus finds refuge in District 9 and stumbles into Christopher's shack. A lost command module from the ship is revealed underneath the shack, and Christopher discloses that the fluid in the canister is fuel which would allow him to reactivate the dormant mothership and reverse Wikus' mutation. The canister is held at MNU headquarters, so Wikus and Christopher agree on a plan to get it back by first obtaining weapons from superstitious Nigerian arms-dealer Obesandjo and his gang.
After acquiring the weapons, Wikus and Christopher attack the MNU offices, retrieve the canister, and flee back to District 9 with MNU forces in pursuit. Appalled by the illegal experiments on his fellow aliens at MNU headquarters, Christopher says he must use all the fuel to get help before curing Wikus, but the trip to the alien planet and back will take three years. Wikus becomes enraged and attacks Christopher, then hijacks the command module which is almost immediately shot down. Venter and his men seize Wikus and Christopher, but Obesandjo's gang ambushes the MNU convoy and captures Wikus, as Obesandjo believes that eating Wikus' mutated arm will give him the ability to use alien weaponry. Obesandjo's base is then surrounded by MNU and a firefight ensues.
In the downed command module, Christopher's son activates the mothership and an alien mechanized battle suit which saves Wikus by killing Obesandjo and his men. Wikus takes control of the battle suit and rescues Christopher, shielding him as they run to the command module. Wikus aids Christopher's escape by staying behind and holding off the MNU troops. Christopher promises to return in three years before making his way to the command module. Wikus kills all the troops except Venter, who cripples his suit and forces it to eject him. As Wikus is cornered by Venter, a group of aliens ambush Venter, tearing him to pieces. Christopher leaves in the mothership with his son as Johannesburg's residents celebrate its departure.
A series of interviews and news broadcasts are shown, with people theorizing about Wikus' whereabouts and the potential return of the mothership, and what it could entail. MNU's illegal experiments on the aliens are uncovered and exposed. District 9 is completely demolished, with all the aliens having been moved to the new larger District 10 farther from the city. Wikus' wife Tania finds a metal flower on her doorstep, giving her hope that Wikus is still alive. The final scene shows what appears to be a fully transformed Wikus crafting a similar flower in a scrapyard.","spaceship,scientology,trust,tense,thought provoking,stylized,rough,exciting,illegal aliens,changing into an alien,biting,alien weapons,bleak,father and son,alien,offbeat,prawns,fear",1308.jpg,2009-08-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/district-9/id331251689?uo=4,"d6PDlMggROA,2huFZpVeZX0,TChY6NIxqgQ,kvDkN0kxe5w,UdzgdfSkc7k",70113005,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/District_9/70113005,"Action & Adventure,Art House & International,Drama,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

1010,Django,"Though Sergio Leone created the spaghetti western with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, the genre was not popularized in Europe until Sergio Corbucci's DJANGO, which subsequently spawned countless illegitimate sequels. The film stars the Belgian hunk Franco Nero as Django, a mysterious gunslinger who drags a coffin behind him that contains a Gatling gun. Django soon happens upon a Mexican town where a group of Mexican revolutionaries, led by the nefarious Colonel Jackson, have overrun the town, wantonly killing its citizens. Soon, Django, who has a personal vendetta against Colonel Jackson, finds himself in league with a group of Mexican bandits who want to steal the Colonel's gold with the help of Django and his Gatling gun. Combining a stylish use of spaghetti western conventions -- among them a cruel and cartoonish bad guy as well as dramatic music that punctuates the action -- DJANGO is one of the best and most popular films the genre has ever produced.","Django (Franco Nero) is a drifter who drags around a closed coffin. He rescues a young woman, from being murdered by bandits led by Major Jackson (Eduardo Fajardo), a man on whom Django is seeking revenge for the murder of his wife.
After killing most of Jackson's men, Django makes a deal with a Mexican bandit general, Hugo Rodriguez who is in conflict with Jackson, and the two steal a large quantity of gold from a Mexican Army fort (where Jackson is doing business with a government general). When Rodriguez drags his feet in giving Django his share, he and Maria steal the gold. Unfortunately, the gold falls into quicksand. When Rodriguez catches up to them, Maria is shot (though she survives) and Django's hands are crushed by Rodriguez's men as punishment for being a thief. Rodr‚àö‚â†guez and his men are massacred by Jackson and the Mexican Army when the bandits return to Mexico. Jackson then goes looking for Django in a cemetery after killing Nathaniel. However, Django, who has bitten the trigger-guard off his pistol, kills Jackson and his five surviving men by pressing the trigger against a cross (on the grave of a female acquaintance of Django earlier killed by Jackson) and repeatedly dropping the hammer.

Schultz then buys Django by force and advises the slaves to either take the surviving Speck brother to the nearest town or kill him and bury him and his brother and escape north. Schultz and Django then depart, leaving the fate of the other Speck brother to the remaining slaves. Schultz reveals that he sought out Django to aid him in identifying the Brittle brothers, a trio of ruthless killers working for a plantation owner. The two come to an agreement: in exchange for helping locate and identify the Brittle brothers, Schultz will free Django from slavery and give him $75 and a horse. After they hunt down and kill the Brittle brothers, Schultz partners with Django in bounty hunting until spring, at which time he will assist Django in tracking down and rescuing Broomhilde. Over the winter, Schultz trains Django in bounty hunting and mastering a sidearm.
After collecting a number of bounties over the winter, Schultz and Django confirm that Broomhilde's current owner is Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a charming but brutal plantation owner in Mississippi who forces his slaves to fight to the death in ""Mandingo fights"". Schultz expects that Candie will demand an extortionate price for Broomhilde if they are forthright with their intentions, so they devise a ruse whereby they will pretend to seek the purchase of one of Candie's prize fighters for a hefty sum, meanwhile purchase Broomhilde on-the-side for a more reasonable sum, then disappear before they finalize the bogus deal. Schultz and Django meet Candie at a club in Greenville and offer to buy one of his fighters for $12,000. His greed tickled, Candie invites them to his plantation. On the road, Schultz and Django witness Candie murder one of his Mandingo fighters, who fled due to not wanting to fight any more, by having him torn apart by dogs. At the plantation, Schultz secretly informs Broomhilde of the plot. At dinner, Schultz expresses an incidental interest in Broomhilde because she speaks German, and offers $300 for her.
Django raises the suspicions of Candie's staunchly loyal senior house slave, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), who correctly deduces that Django and Broomhilde know each other and that the sale of the Mandingo fighter is a ruse, and informs Candie in private. This enrages Candie, who, armed with this information, demands the $12,000 for Broomhilde instead, or he will kill her. Schultz agrees to buy her at this price in order to save her life. After the money is paid and the paperwork signed, Candie demands to shake hands with Schultz to finalize the deal, or Broomhilde will be shot. Schultz, in disgust, shoots and kills Candie point-blank with a concealed Derringer gun. Schultz is shot too, and a gun fight erupts. Django shoots many of Candie's henchmen but has to surrender when Stephen threatens to have Broomhilde killed.
As punishment, Stephen and Candie's sister Lara agree to send Django to a mine to be worked to death. Broomhilde, instead of being given her freedom, is locked in a cabin to be used as a sex slave. En route to the mine, Django convinces the slave drivers that he is a bounty hunter, shows them the handbill from his first kill as evidence, and falsely informs them that there is a high-end bounty on some outlaws who have taken refuge back at Candie's plantation. He offers them a cut of the bounty if they free him and ride with him. The moment they free him, he kills the slave drivers, takes their dynamite, and rides back to Candyland.
Returning to the plantation, Django discovers Schultz's body. He takes the bill of sale that Candie signed for Broomhilde and her certificate of freedom signed by Schultz and reunites with her after freeing her from where she was being held. When Candie's mourners return to the Candyland mansion from his funeral, Django reveals himself. He sends off the remaining slaves and kills everyone inside except Stephen, whom he shoots in the knees. Having set the dynamite inside the house, he lights the fuse and leaves. Django and Broomhilde watch from a distance as the house explodes, killing Stephen, and ride away.","oscar nominee,oscar 2013,oscar",7203.jpg,2012-12-25,,s8CZKbDzP1E,70230640,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Django_Unchained/70230640,"Western,Drama,Action & Adventure"
2851,Do the Right Thing,"This powerful visual feast combines humor and drama with memorable characters while tracing the course of a single day on a block in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn. It's the hottest day of the year, a scorching 24-hour period that will change the lives of its residents forever. Danny Aiello co-stars in this absorbing tale of inner-city life that heats up with vivid images and unforgettable performances.","Mookie (Lee) is a young black man living in a black neighborhood in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn with his sister, Jade (Joie Lee), who wants him out of her apartment. He works delivering pizzas for a local pizzeria, but he lacks ambition and he works to support his girlfriend Tina (Perez) and their son Hector.
Salvatore ""Sal"" Frangione (Aiello), the pizzeria‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Italian-American owner, has owned the restaurant and been in the neighborhood for twenty-five years. His older son, Giuseppe, better known as Pino (Turturro), ""detests the place like a sickness"", holds racial contempt for the neighborhood blacks and attempts to make Mookie's life miserable. Sal's younger son, Vito (Edson), is friends with Mookie.
The street corner is filled with distinct personalities, most of whom are just trying to find a way to deal with the intense heat on what is the hottest day in years and go about their regular day-to-day activities. A drunk called Da Mayor (Davis) is constantly trying to win both the approval and affection of the neighborhood matron, Mother Sister (Dee), who watches the neighborhood's activity from her brownstone. A young man named Radio Raheem (Nunn) lives for nothing else but to blast Public Enemy's ""Fight the Power"" on his boombox wherever he goes. He wears ""love"" and ""hate"" four-fingered rings (brass knuckles) on either hand, which he explains in one scene symbolize the struggle between the two forces. (The speech is a nearly word-for-word retelling of a speech given by Reverend Harry Powell in the film The Night of the Hunter.)
A mentally disabled man named Smiley (Smith) meanders around the neighborhood, holding up hand-colored pictures of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. The local radio disc jockey, ""Mister Se‚àö¬±or Love Daddy"" (Samuel L. Jackson) rounds out the neighborhood. Three men (Harris, Benjamin, Faison), known as ""the Corner Men,"" act as a sort of Greek chorus, commenting on the neighborhood and the day's events. Four teenagers ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Cee, Punchy, Ahmad and Ella ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ deal with the heat outside as well.
While eating a slice at Sal's, Buggin' Out (Esposito) questions Sal about the ""Wall of Fame"" and demands he put up some pictures of black celebrities on the wall, since, he explains, Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood and sells pizza to black people. Sal replies that it is his store; he is proud of his Italian heritage and he doesn't have to feature anyone but Italians on his wall. Buggin' Out starts an argument with Sal, during which Sal threatens to ""bash his head"" with a baseball bat. Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the ""Wall of Fame,"" but no one will support his protest except Radio Raheem and Smiley.
Over the course of the day tensions rise around the neighborhood. Teenagers open a fire hydrant for respite from the heat, flooding a passer-by's car and police officers intervene. Radio Raheem ""argues"" with some Puerto Rican men simply by playing their radios loudly at each other. Buggin' Out instigates a fight with a white man, Clifton (John Savage) who accidentally steps on his Air Jordan shoes, and Da Mayor saves a boy from being run over by a car. Sal argues with Radio Raheem for blasting his boombox in the pizzeria. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over which race is better, blacks or Italians, which leads to a series of scenes in which the characters, addressing the camera, spew a variety of racial insults.
In the afternoon, Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, Pino expressing his hatred and Sal insisting that, whether Pino likes it or not, his pizzeria, and his pizza, is part of the neighborhood there, and he isn't leaving. Then Sal watches, embarrassed, as Pino yells at Smiley outside. Mookie almosts gets fired by Sal, but Jade comes to Sal's shop, cooling Sal's anger. Outside, Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal. As they're cleaning to close the restaurant Mookie demands his weekly pay from Sal. Buggin' Out convinces Radio Raheem and Smiley to join his protest and they begin insulting and threatening the yelling neighbors.
That night, four teenagers arrive and Sal lets them in. After serving them, he closes. Suddenly, Radio Raheem, Smiley and Buggin' Out march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the pictures on the wall. Radio Raheem's boombox is blaring at the highest volume, and Sal demands that they turn the radio down or leave the shop, but the two men refuse to do so. They yell at each other, threatening, until Sal, in a fit of frustration and anger, calls Radio Raheem a ""nigger,"" then snaps and destroys Radio Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat. Radio Raheem attacks Sal, starting a fight with all the teenage boys, Sal and his sons, which spills out onto the street, attracting a crowd of spectators. As Radio Raheem is strangling Sal to death, Da Mayor yells at them to stop the fight.
The police arrive at the scene, break up the fight and begin to apprehend Radio Raheem and Buggin' Out. Buggin' Out is arrested while Radio Raheem is placed in a chokehold by one officer, killing him. The police officers begin yelling at an already dead Radio Raheem ""to quit faking"" and they kick him. The police officers, realizing they have killed a black man in front of an angry crowd, take Radio Raheem's body back to the squad car, while in another squad car, a police officer beats Buggin' Out. The angry crowd chases the police, who leave the scene with Radio Raheem's body, and leave Sal, Vito and Pino alone with the angry crowd.
Afterward, the large crowd of onlookers are enraged about Radio Raheem's death and blame Sal and his sons. A tense moment ensues when the crowd contemplates violence against Sal, Vito, and Pino. Da Mayor intervenes telling the crowd to go home, because someone will get hurt, and the crowd threatens Da Mayor. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's restaurant, yelling ""hate"" which turns the collective anger towards the property and away from the owners. Da Mayor pulls Sal out of the mob's way. Vito, Pino and Sal watch in horror as the restaurant gets destroyed.
The angry crowd becomes a riotous mob, rushes into the restaurant and destroys everything, while Smiley sets the restaurant on fire. From there, the mob begins to head for the Korean market. Sonny, the owner, tries to fight them off with a broom, yelling that he is one of them: ""I no white! I black! You, me, same! We same!"" causing the mob to spare his store. Firefighters arrive and begin spraying Sal's building while the crowd yells Howard Beach as they are held back by riot patrol. The firefighters, after several warnings to the crowd, turn their hoses on the mob, further enraging them.
Police officers begin struggling with the mob and some people are arrested. The mob attacks some of the firemen as they try to spray Sal's building. Da Mayor gets in the middle of the ensuing chaos and pulls a screaming Mother Sister out of the scene as Mookie and his sister watch the horror around them. Meanwhile, Smiley wanders back into the smoldering restaurant, past Radio Raheem's burning boombox, and as ""Fight the Power"" plays, he hangs a picture of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. on what's left of Sal's ""Wall of Fame.""
The next day, Radio Love Daddy discusses what transpired the previous night, asking, ""are we ever going to live together?"" After having an argument with Tina over what it is to be a man, Mookie returns to Sal, who feels betrayed by Mookie for destroying the restaurant. They get into an argument but then Mookie and Sal cautiously reconcile. He demands his weekly pay he had earlier been demanding to receive in advance, which he gets.","more...,sincere,joy,thought provoking,humorous,stylized,new york,reality,less...,biting,contemplative,clever,atmospheric,offbeat",2851.jpg, ,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/do-the-right-thing/id282538466?uo=4 ,,,,"Comedy,Drama"
2817,Doctor Zhivago,"Lara inspires lechery in Komarovsky (her mother's lover who is a master at surviving whoever runs Russia) and can't compete with passion for the revolution of the man she marries, Pasha. Her true love is Zhivago who also loves his wife. Lara is the one who inspires poetry. The story is narrated by Zhivago's half brother Yevgraf, who has made his career in the Soviet Army. At the beginning of the film he is about to meet a young woman he believes may be the long lost daughter of Lara and Zhivago.","The film takes place mostly against a backdrop of World War I, the Russian Revolution and Russian Civil War. A narrative framing device, set in the late 1940s to early 1950s, involves KGB Lieutenant General Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago (Alec Guinness) searching for the daughter of his half brother, doctor Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago (Omar Sharif), and Larissa (""Lara"") Antipova (Julie Christie). Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tonya Komarovskaya (Rita Tushingham) may be his niece, and tells her the story of her father's life.
We first meet the protagonist Yuri Zhivago as a young boy who is orphaned after his mother's death. He is given his mother's balalaika, a Russian musical instrument, which becomes a symbol of the creativity that runs in his family. He is taken in by his mother's friends, Alexander 'Sasha' (Ralph Richardson) and Anna (Siobh‚àö¬∞n McKenna) Gromeko ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ and grows up with their daughter Tonya (Geraldine Chaplin). We next see Zhivago as a medical student in training, but a poet at heart, who declares that he wants to be a family doctor rather than a medical researcher. Tonya returns after a trip to Paris, wearing the latest fashions. Shortly after, Yuri marries Tonya because her mother expects him to do it, but does so without much enthusiasm.
In a parallel plot-line, Lara, a dressmaker's daughter and schoolgirl, becomes involved in an affair with Victor Ipolitovich Komarovsky (Rod Steiger), her mother's (Adrienne Corri) lover. That same night, the idealistic reformer Pavel Pavlovich (""Pasha"") Antipov (Tom Courtenay) is wounded with a sabre cut across his face by hussars during a peaceful street protest. Pasha runs to Lara, whom he wants to marry, to treat his wound, and asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the demonstration. He declares that the days of peaceful protests are over; a new spirit of cynicism and militancy are what is needed, which symbolize his and others turning to Bolshevism (Communism) as the answer to the autocracy of Tsar Nicholas II. Zhivago witnesses the same event from his balcony, seeing the brutality of the Tsarist hussars. He is deeply shaken by the event, attempts to save the wounded in the street, and is told by a Tsarist officer to get off the street.
Lara's mother discovers her affair with Komarovsky and attempts suicide. Komarovsky summons help from a the physician who is Zhivago's medical professor and Zhivago arrives as the physician's assistant. He sees Lara for the first time. When Komarovsky later learns of Lara's intentions to marry Pasha, he tries to dissuade Lara, and then rapes her. In revenge, Lara takes the pistol she has been hiding for Pasha and shoots Komarovsky during a Christmas Eve party also attended by Zhivago, wounding Komorovski. At this point the separate plots merge and all the characters become aware of each other. Komarovsky insists that no action be taken against Lara, who is escorted out by Pasha. Zhivago tends Komarovsky's wound. Although enraged by Lara's affair with Komarovski, the formerly idealistic Pasha marries Lara, and later they have a daughter, Katya.
With the beginning of World War I, the Russian Empire declares war on the German Empire and the Austro-Hungarian Empire; we witness the patriotic hysteria in Moscow, and the new recruits marching off to war. Yevgraf Zhivago is sent by Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, the first incarnation of what later became the Communist Party of the Soviet Union to join the Imperial Russian Army for purposes of subverting the troops at the front. Pasha, who has joined the army because of his idealism and his dissolving marriage with Lara, is reported missing in action following a foolhardy frontal attack on the German lines. Lara enlists as a nurse in order to search for Pasha. Yuri Zhivago is drafted and becomes an army doctor. Following the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II and the February Revolution, revolutionary fervor spreads to the front-line troops, who have been ill-led, half-clothed, and without enough weapons. When a group of newly arrived troops meet a mass of military deserters from the front, the Russian officers are killed, and doctor Zhivago enlists Lara's help to tend to the wounded. Together they run a field hospital in a former country estate for six months, during which time radical changes convulse Russia, as Vladimir Lenin arrives in Moscow and stages the October Revolution in Petrograd (not shown in the film), then the capital of Imperial Russia. During this time at the field hospital, Zhivago and Lara are in daily contact, and fall in love.
After the war, Yuri returns to his wife Tonya, son Sasha, and his father-in-law, Alexander, whose house in Moscow has been divided into flats by the new Soviet government. Zhivago, not knowing the political situation, is watched by the leader of the local Soviet committee. As a physician, Zhivago knows that there is an epidemic of typhus in the city, which is officially denied; his first experience of the new government's deception or cover-up. His half-brother Yevgraf, who is now a CHEKA officer, in one of many coincidences throughout the film, sees Zhivago scavenging wood, follows him to Alexander's apartment, dismisses the hovering local Soviet committee persons with a snap of his fingers, and reveals his identity as half-brother to Zhivago. He informs him that his poems are ""not liked"" by certain powerful persons, as being petty bourgeois and ""personal."" Zhivago, naive about the new political order, asserts to Yevraf that ""he cannot approve today what the (Communist) party may do tomorrow."" Hearing those sentiments, Yevgraf realizes that Zhivago will soon be arrested as politically unreliable, so he arranges for passes and documents in order for Yuri and his family to escape from the new political capital of Moscow to the far away Gromeko country estate at Varykino, west of the Ural Mountains.
In contrast to Tonya's earlier arrival on a comfortable train from Paris, Zhivago, Tonya, Sasha and Alexander now board a train of boxcars in which crude bunk beds have been built, at which time they are informed that they'll be travelling through contested territory (during the Russian Civil War), which is being secured by a famous Bolshevik commander named Strelnikov (Russian for ""The Shooter""), who steams up and down the Trans-Siberian Railway line in an armoured train. It is at this point that we meet Kostoyed (Klaus Kinski), an anarchist intellectual being sent to Siberia in chains. The journey in the boxcar filled with fifty people seems to the Zhivago family to be interminable, with only Yuri and Yuri's son seeing it as an adventure. While the train is stopped on a siding, Zhivago wanders away, and stumbles across the armoured train of Strelnikov, stopped at a siding in the forest. Zhivago is taken as a prisoner to Strelnikov and recognizes him as the former Pasha Antipov. Zhivago is first suspected as a White Russian agent sent to assassinate Strelnikov. Zhivago is subjected to an interrogation during which Strelnikov asserts that ""the personal life is dead in Russia; history has killed it"" and Zhivago answers that ""I hate everything you say, but not enough to kill you for it."" The tension level drops. After determining that he and Zhivago have met before, and that Zhivago is a famous published poet, Strelnikov informs Yuri that Lara is living in the town of Yuriatin ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ very close to where Yuri will be living.
The Zhivago family arrives at Varykino, which has a large mansion and a small outbuilding. Since there is a notice that the mansion is the property of the state, they live in the outbuilding. They grow their own food and lead lives much as the Russian serfs had in the past. In the spring, Zhivago's thoughts turns toward Lara, whom he knows is living close-by. Zhivago finds Lara in nearby Yuriatin. They surrender to their long repressed feelings, beginning an affair, and a blissful time for them both. But when Tonya becomes pregnant, Zhivago swears he will break off with Lara, only to be conscripted that day into service by Communist partisans. After two years as a military doctor with the forces fighting the White Russian rebels, Zhivago at last deserts, struggling through deep snow, almost dying, to Yuriatin, and Lara. After six happy months, Lara reveals a letter from Tonya, in which she tells Yuri that she, her father, and Sasha have been deported, and had met with Lara while searching for Yuri.
During a fierce storm one night, Komarovsky arrives and informs them that they are being watched by the CHEKA due to Lara's marriage to Strelnikov and Yuri's ""counter-revolutionary"" poetry and desertion. Komarovsky offers Yuri and Lara his help in leaving Soviet Russia, but they refuse. Instead, they go to the isolated Varykino estate, which during the winter has turned into a kind of frosted ice-palace. To the sound of wolves howling in the nearby forest, Yuri begins writing the ""Lara"" poems, which will later make him famous but incur government displeasure. The wolves are a premonition; Komarovsky reappears again and tells Yuri that Strelnikov tried to reach Lara, was detained by authorities, and shot himself while being taken to his execution; Lara is in immediate danger, as the CHEKA had only left her free to lure Strelnikov into the open. Zhivago sends Lara away with Komarovsky, who has used his influence within the Communist Party to be appointed Minister of Justice of the Far Eastern Republic, a Soviet puppet state in Siberia. Refusing to leave with a man he despises, Yuri remains behind.
Years later, during the Stalinist era, Yuri sees Lara while travelling on a tram, a mirroring of the tram scene in which he first sees Lara. Forcing his way off the tram, he runs after her, at which point he suffers a fatal heart attack. Yuri's funeral is well attended, as his poetry is already being published openly due to shifts in politics. Lara informs Yevgraf that she had given birth to Yuri's daughter, but lost her in the collapse of the White-controlled government in Mongolia. After vainly looking over hundreds of orphans with Yevgraf's help, Lara disappears during Joseph Stalin's Great Purge, and ""died or vanished somewhere, in one of the labour camps,"" according to Yevgraf.
While Yevgraf strongly believes that Tanya Komarovskaya is Yuri's and Lara's daughter, she is still not convinced. Yevgraf notices that Tonya carries with her a balalaika. He recalls that Yuri's mother left him one after her death. Finding that Tanya learned to play the balalaika by herself, he smiles, ""Ah, then, it's a gift,"" thereby implying that she truly must be their daughter after all.","exciting,emotional,atmospheric,captivating,contemplative",2817.jpg,1965-12-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/doctor-zhivago/id272602984?uo=4,hvIL_A0UsJk,,,"Classics,Drama,Romance,Television"

3464,Doubt,"Based on the Pulitzer Prize and Tony Awardwinning play, Doubt is a mesmerizing, suspensefilled drama with four riveting performances from Meryl Streep, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Amy Adams and Viola Davis that will have you pinned to the edge of your seat. Sister Aloysius Beauvier (Streep), the rigid and fearinspiring principal of the Saint Nicholas Church School, suffers an extreme dislike for the progressive and popular parish priest Father Flynn (Hoffman). Looking for wrongdoing in every corner, Sister Aloysius believes she's uncovered the ultimate sin when she hears Father Flynn has taken a special interest in a troubled boy. But without proof, the only thing certain is doubt.","Set in 1964 at a Catholic church in the Bronx, New York, the film opens with the progressive-minded Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman) giving a sermon on the nature of doubt, noting that, like faith, it can be a unifying force. The next evening, Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep), the strict and conservative principal of the attached school, discusses the sermon with her fellow nuns, the Sisters of Charity of New York. She asks if anyone has observed unusual behavior that would inspire Father Flynn to preach about doubt, and instructs them to keep their eyes open should any such behavior occur in the future.
Sister James (Amy Adams), a young and naive teacher, observes the closeness between Father Flynn and Donald Miller, the school's only black student and an altar boy. One day during class, Sister James receives a call asking for Donald Miller to meet Father Flynn in the rectory. When he returns, Donald is distraught and Sister James notices the smell of alcohol on his breath. Later, while her students are learning a dance in the gymnasium, she sees Father Flynn placing a white shirt in Donald's locker. Sister James reports her observations to Sister Aloysius.
Under the pretext of discussing the school's upcoming Christmas pageant, Sisters Aloysius and (to a lesser extent) James voice their suspicions that Father Flynn's relationship with Donald may be inappropriate. Several times Father Flynn asks them to leave the matter alone as a private issue between the boy and himself, but Sister Aloysius persists. Finally, he is pressured into admitting that Donald had been caught drinking altar wine, and he had promised Donald not to tell anyone about the incident. Having now been forced to break that promise and reveal the truth, he will need to dismiss Donald as an altar boy, which he had been trying to avoid. Before leaving, Father Flynn tells Sister Aloysius he is displeased with her handling of the situation. His next sermon regards gossip and how it is easily spread.
Initially, Sister James is relieved and convinced of Father Flynn's innocence, but Sister Aloysius's belief that he has behaved inappropriately with Donald is unshakable. Sister James later asks Father Flynn about the shirt she saw him leaving in Donald's locker, having not revealed this detail to Sister Aloysius. They discuss his relationship with the boy. Father Flynn offers a reasonable explanation for the situation and Sister James's doubts are assuaged.
Sister Aloysius meets with Donald Miller's mother regarding her suspicions. Mrs. Miller (Viola Davis) shocks Sister Aloysius with her lack of interest in the alleged misconduct on Father Flynn's part. As far as she is concerned Donald need only last to the end of the school year, as graduation from a prestigious church school would increase his chances of going to a decent high school. It is hinted that Donald is homosexual and revealed that his father is abusive, with the implication that one causes the other. Mrs. Miller begs that Sister Aloysius drop the matter, feeling that Father Flynn is a source of inspiration to Donald and a shield from the abuse he receives at home. She becomes angry when Sister Aloysius refuses to compromise and threatens to throw Donald out of the school. Mrs. Miller believes that Donald would be punished for a thing he was not the cause of.
Despite having no evidence and no support from anyone, Sister Aloysius again confronts Father Flynn and demands that he tell her the truth; otherwise, she will go to the Bishop. Father Flynn is adamant that there is no illicit relationship, but Sister Aloysius has learned that he has a history of problems, having moved between three different parishes in the last five years. She tells him that she has contacted a nun from one of his prior churches (she refuses to say whom), who corroborated her suspicions. Father Flynn is furious that she has contacted a nun rather than the church's pastor, which is proper church protocol. Sister Aloysius tells him he doesn't deserve to wear the collar, and asks for his resignation. Unable to stand up to her determination to ruin his reputation, he succumbs to her demands.
Following his final sermon, Father Flynn steps down from the pulpit and shakes hands with the members of the congregation. Some time later, Sisters Aloysius and James are sitting together in the church garden. Sister Aloysius tells Sister James that although Father Flynn resigned, the bishop has appointed him to pastor at a larger church and its parochial school, in essence promoting him to a more prestigious position. She then admits she lied about speaking to a nun at Father Flynn's former church, and thus drove him out with no more than her suspicions; her justification is that if Father Flynn truly were innocent, he would not have given in. Repeating a line from earlier in the film, Sister Aloysius says that ""in the pursuit of wrongdoing, one steps away from God.""
Sister Aloysius concludes that one also pays a price in pursuing wrongdoing. She breaks down in tears and says to Sister James: ""I have doubts...I have such doubts."" The film ends with Sister James comforting Sister Aloysius. And with no actual proof that Father Flynn is or is not innocent, the audience is left with its own doubt.","sincere,clever,contemplative",3464.jpg,2008-10-30, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/doubt/id432472833?uo=4,OnrmWLp1Ub8,70100377,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Doubt/70100377,Drama
1189,Douchebag,"Sam (Andrew Dickler) is a few days away from marrying Steph (Marguerite Moreau), a beautiful woman who is madly in love with him. Everything is going well - just a few, final arrangements need to be made - but Steph simply doesn't understand why Sam's only brother, Tom, (Ben York Jones ) is not coming to the wedding. When she takes it upon herself to surprise Sam by picking Tom up and driving him down for the event, the estranged brothers find themselves under the same roof for the first time in years, unprepared to confront whatever it was that drove them apart in the first place. Since Tom has no date for the wedding, Sam decides they should hit the road to find Tom's former flame. The problem is, he hasn't seen her since the fifth grade. What ensues is a riotous road trip that starts off as Tom's search for his old girlfriend, but ends up as Sam's search for a last taste of freedom before he settles down for good.","A loud-mouthed lout has a less than cordial reunion with his brother in this independent comedy drama from director Drake Doremus. Sam Nussbaum (Andrew Dickler) is an insufferably opinionated loser who has somehow managed to charm a beautiful young woman, Steph (Marguerite Moreau), who has agreed to marry him. Steph is puzzled when she learns that Sam hasn't invited his brother, Tom (Ben York Jones), to the upcoming wedding; Sam doesn't want to talk about it, so Steph decides to surprise her fiance by arranging for Tom to come to Los Angeles, where the couple lives. Sam and Tom had a falling out years before that neither of them likes to talk about, and as the siblings get reacquainted, the emotional distance between them is clear. When Tom mentions in passing that the only girl he ever loved was a classmate from grade school, Sam insists they drop everything and set out to find her; this leads to a grand-scale road trip that at once brings the brothers together and reinforces their opinions of one another, while also giving Sam a reason to postpone a wedding he no longer wants. Douchebag received its world premiere at the 2010 Sundance Film Festival.","witty,humorous,sentimental,uplifting",1189.jpg,2010-10-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/douchebag/id415604775?uo=4,,70129365,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Douchebag/70129365,"Comedy,Drama"
3283,Drag Me to Hell,"Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is an ambitious L.A. loan officer with a charming boyfriend, professor Clay Dalton (Justin Long). Life is good until the mysterious Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) arrives at the bank to beg for an extension on her home loan. Should Christine follow her instincts and give the old woman a break? Or should she deny the extension to impress her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), and get a leg-up on a promotion? Christine fatefully chooses the latter, shaming Mrs. Ganush and dispossessing her of her home. In retaliation, the old woman places the powerful curse of the Lamia on Christine, transforming her life into a living hell. Haunted by an evil spirit and misunderstood by a skeptical boyfriend, she seeks the aid of seer Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) to save her soul from eternal damnation. To help the shattered Christine return her life to normal, the psychic sets her on a frantic course to reverse the spell. As evil forces close in, Christine must face the unthinkable: how far will she go to break free of the curse?","In 1969 in Pasadena, California, a couple seeks the aid of the medium Shaun San Dena (Flor de Maria Chahua) because their son (Shiloh Selassie) has been hearing evil spirits' voices after stealing a silver necklace from gypsies. San Dena aids the family by carrying out a seance, but they are attacked by an unseen force that pulls the boy into Hell. The medium says she will encounter the force again one day.
In today's Los Angeles, bank loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) hopes to be promoted to assistant manager over her co-worker Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee). Her boss, Jim Jacks (David Paymer), advises her to demonstrate that she can make tough decisions to get a promotion. Christine is visited by an elderly woman, Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver), who asks for an extension on her mortgage payment. Christine, though empathetic with the old woman's crisis, decides to deny Ganush an extension to prove herself to her boss. Ganush begs Christine not to repossess her house and kneels in front of her, but Christine gets scared from the woman's bizarre pleading as she is helping her to stand up. This leads the security to take Ganush away. Jim compliments Christine on how she handled the situation after the woman gives Christine a threat.
In the bank parking garage, Ganush attacks Christine in her car, rips a button off Christine's coat and uses it to place a curse on her as revenge for ""shaming"" her. Later, Christine and her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) meet the fortune teller Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), who tells Christine that she is being haunted by a spirit. At her home, Christine is attacked by the spirit and has nightmares about Ganush. At work the next day, Christine snaps at Stu and has a projectile nosebleed that soaks her boss in blood. She runs away and Stu is seen secretly taking a file off Christine's desk.
Christine then goes to talk to Ganush at her granddaughter's home, only to find that she died the previous night and a memorial service is being held. Christine returns to Rham Jas, who explains that as long as Christine is the owner of an accursed object (her button), she will be haunted by a powerful demon called the Lamia (not to be confused with the Greek child-eating demon) that will torment her for three days before taking her to Hell. He suggests a sacrifice to appease the demon. The next day, the Lamia returns and thrashes Christine in her bedroom. Desperate to stop the attacks, Christine sacrifices her pet kitten, an act that leaves her heart-broken. At a dinner party with Clay and his parents, she is again tormented by the Lamia, but this time through the use of illusions, which frightens the Daltons.
Christine returns to Rham Jas for further help. He says that Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza) will risk her life to stop the demon for a fee of $10,000. Further supernatural attacks on Christine lead Clay to pay the fee. San Dena prepares a seance to trap the Lamia's spirit in a goat and kill it to vanquish the spirit. San Dena allows the Lamia to inhabit her body. Rham Jas tries to persuade it not to steal Christine's soul, but it refuses and vows never to stop until Christine dies. Christine then places San Dena's hand on the goat, causing the spirit to enter its body. San Dena's assistant, Milos, attempts to kill the goat, but is instead bitten by the goat and in turn becomes possessed, attacking the members of the seance. San Dena banishes the Lamia from the seance, but dies in the process. Christine thinks the medium has overcome the Lamia, but Rham Jas explains that she only managed to drive the spirit away until the next day, when it will come back for Christine. Then he seals the cursed button in an envelope and tells Christine that before the next day comes, she can get rid of the curse by giving the button to someone as a gift, thereby passing the curse on to that person.
After being driven home by Clay, Christine attempts to find a recipient for the curse. She decides to give the envelope to Stu, in revenge for his stealing her work, but changes her mind after seeing how pathetic, tearful and panicky Stu is when he meets her. With guidance from Rham Jas, Christine learns that she can give it to Ganush, even though she is dead, because ""the soul never dies"". Christine drives to the cemetery where she is buried and digs up her grave. In a torrential downpour, Christine jams the envelope in Ganush's mouth in anger for the curse she placed on her.
The next day, Christine goes to meet Clay at Los Angeles Union Station, from where they plan to depart for a weekend in Santa Barbara. Her boss also leaves a message telling her that she landed her dream position after Stu confesses of stealing her work and gets fired. She also buys a coat that she has been eyeing for a long time, as a sign of a new beginning. Clay, planning to propose, reveals to Christine that he found the envelope containing the cursed button in his car. Christine then realizes she mixed up her envelope with another that she gave to Clay when she accidentally dropped it. Horrified, Christine backs away falling onto the tracks. As a train barrels towards her, fiery hands burst from the ground under the tracks. Clay can only watch in horror as Christine is dragged down into the fiery abyss of Hell. The movie ends with a horrified Clay holding Christine's cursed button.","scary,disgust,suspenseful,evil spirits,teeth,atmospheric,fear",3283.jpg,2009-03-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/drag-me-to-hell/id328285835?uo=4,BUZTybLlWKI,70104315,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Drag_Me_to_Hell/70104315,"Horror,Mystery & Suspense"
1647,Dream Home,"When she was a child, Cheng Lai-sheung (Josie Ho) could see Hong Kong Victoria Harbour from her apartment. But as time passed, the old buildings in front of her home were demolished to make way for a huge residential project that now blocks her view. Increasingly disappointed and upset, she vowed to one day save up enough money for her family to move into a new apartment with a magnificent sea view. In order to get what she wants, she must take matters into her own hands...even if it means getting her hands seriously bloody.","In Hong Kong, Cheng Lai-sheung (Josie Ho) works two jobs with the hope of earning enough money to buy her own apartment with a view of the Victoria Harbor. Cheng eventually saves enough for her dream home when a hike in the stock market makes the owners decide to raise the price. This sends Cheng into a murderous frenzy where she attacks people who live or work in the coveted high-rise towers.
In mixed chronological order, we see scenes from Lai-sheung's life. In her childhood, her family and friends are evicted from their low-rent housing so that developers can turn it into expensive, seaview flats. Later in life, she vows to buy her mum and dad a new flat, but is unable to fulfill her promise before her mother dies. When her father becomes ill, she begins searching in earnest for a new place, finally fixating on the expensive building that now stands where she previously lived with her family. The flat costs millions, though, and the bank will only give her a 70% mortgage. The payments would reach over $15,000, and her two part-time jobs might not permit her to pay that.
Unfortunately, because of an oversight in declaring her father's medical history, she no longer has insurance to pay for his expensive treatment. Thus, Lai-sheung must get a second job to save enough money for the flat of her dreams. Though she saves enough for a down-payment, her fathers medical bills become excessive. Lai-sheung asks her married lover to loan her some money for medical bills, but he refuses. One night, her father has trouble breathing; instead of giving him his oxygen, Lai-sheung allows her father to die. The insurance payment adds enough money to her current savings for her to purchase her dream flat.
She immediately calls her real estate agent and agrees to take the flat at No 1 Victoria Bay. On her way to finalise the agreement, there is a hike in the stock market that makes the owners decide to raise the price. This sends Lai-sheung into a devastating frenzy where she attacks people who live in the high-rise, killing them with low-tech and household items. First, it is a security guard, whom she suffocates with a zip-tie. Next, she goes upstairs and kills a pregnant woman, her in-house helper, and her cheating husband. Upon hearing loud music from the upstairs flat, Lai-sheung goes up a floor and kills the five people partying in the apartment. During the course of these attacks, Lai-sheung is scratched on the face and stabbed in the ankle. She forms a tourniquet with her sock and another zip-tie. The police arrive at the flat, demanding entry. A struggle ensues, and both officers are (conveniently) killed.
Lai-sheung returns to her day job, and receives a call from her agent. He claims that the owners of the flat wish to sell after all. Lai-sheung suggests that they might want to sell for a much lower price, since there were 11 murders in the building the previous evening. That night, Lai-sheung's lover comes round to pick her up, but she turns her back on him and walks away, ending their relationship.","fellatio,homicide,head bashed in,splatter,protest,unfaithfulness,violent death,suffocation,stabbed in the leg,shot through the mouth,stabbed multiple times,hammer,corpse,stabbed to death,bloody spray,shot point blank,stabbed in the back,vacuum cleaner,stabbed in the head,throat slitting,golf club,severed penis,stomach ripped open,stabbed in the mouth,knife,satire,blood splatter,eye poked out,violence,drugs,pregnant woman murdered,stabbing,body count,intestines,razor,multiple stabbing,blood,finger cut off,blood on the floor,stabbed in the stomach,disembowelment,beaten to death,mutilation,mercy killing,gore,vomit,eyeball,stabbed in the throat",1647.jpg,2010-04-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dream-home/id454711496?uo=4,"xShrmg2dG1c,oSwIrXpvwIo",,,"Art House & International,Drama,Horror"
7267,Dredd,"In the future, America is a dystopian wasteland. The latest scourge is Ma-Ma, a prostitute-turned-drug pusher with a dangerous new drug and aims to take over the city. The only possibility of stopping her is an elite group of urban police called Judges, who combine the duties of judge, jury and executioner to deliver a brutal brand of swift justice. But even the top-ranking Judge, Dredd (Karl Urban), discovers that taking down Ma-Ma isn't as easy as it seems in this explosive adaptation of the hugely popular comic series.","Roughly five minutes in, an incendiary bullet from Judge Dredd's hand-cannon cooks a thug's brain inside his own skull.

He drops, glowing like a human halloween pumpkin. Dredd grimaces. Call it a statement of intent.

The helmet stays on and the gloves are off in screenwriter Alex Garland's grim, ultraviolent reboot, which aims to burn all memories of Sylvester Stallone and Rob Schneider from our minds.

Faithfully refusing to give 2000AD's super-cop (Karl Urban) a noble human face,  sardonic quips or a cuddly-wuddly backstory, Garland wastes no time trapping Dredd and psychic rookie Cassandra (Olivia Thirlby) in a 200-storey skyrise tower block controlled by drug baroness Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).

Back to the future?

We've been here before. Trouble is, Urban and Thirlby grimly battling waves of henchmen in a concrete rat-trap of corridor-to-corridor combat never comes close to matching The Raid's sensational floor-to-ceiling carnage.

Stomping forward like an old-school Verhoeven movie, Dredd keeps you hooked with blunt charisma and some deadpan mega-violence. Bullets split faces, brains spill like dropped porridge and, at one point, Urban flattens a man's windpipe with his fist. Gore even splashes outside the frame, just one of the lovely surrealist touches from ace cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle, who gives his first 3D film a grungy style-rinse that goes some way to disguising its lo-fi budget.

Thanks to a sci-fi narcotic that makes users' brains feel as if time is moving at one per cent its normal speed _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü cute, that, from Garland _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü Dredd gets to lean hard on the slo-mo button, letting blood, water droplets and broken glass shiver beautifully in stereoscopic space.

More colour comes from Headey's B-movie bitch, Wood Harris (The Wire's Avon Barksdale) as her right-hand thug and Thirlby's likeable counterweight to Dredd's stoicism as the sweetie with a hard centre. It's a tough gig for Urban, whose chin gives the performance of its lifetime.

This law enforcer has truly memorable wreckingball personality. But if his head looks a little lost inside that helmet, that growly grimace remains rock-steady.

Grungy, compact and delightfully violent, Dredd wants to hit you as hard as it can. The sequel may be the movie you really want, but for now, justice has been done.

3811,Drive,"Ryan Gosling stars as a Los Angeles wheelman for hire, stunt driving for movie productions by day and steering getaway vehicles for armed heists by night. Though a loner by nature, Driver can't help falling in love with his beautiful neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan), a vulnerable young mother dragged into a dangerous underworld by the return of her ex-convict husband Standard (Oscar Isaac). After a heist intended to pay off Standard's protection money spins unpredictably out of control, Driver finds himself driving defense for the girl he loves, tailgated by a syndicate of deadly serious criminals. But when he realizes that the gangsters are after more than the bag of cash in his trunk-that they're coming straight for Irene and her son-Driver is forced to shift gears and go on offense. -- (C) FilmDistrict","The unnamed Driver (Ryan Gosling) lives in a low-rent apartment building and works as a mechanic in a chop shop owned by Shannon (Bryan Cranston), and as a part-time movie stuntman. He also has a secret job as a getaway driver, organized by Shannon, where his rule is that he never works for the same people twice and only gives the criminals a five-minute window to complete their robbery, after which he will leave them behind. One day, he meets his new neighbor Irene (Carey Mulligan) in the apartment building elevator and later helps her and her young son Benicio (Kaden Leos) when Irene has car trouble at a local supermarket.
Shannon persuades the Jewish mobster Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks) to purchase a stock car for the Driver to race after seeing the Driver's skill. Rose's friend and business partner is Nino, an aging Jewish mobster (Ron Perlman). Nino's friends once had Shannon's pelvis broken when Shannon overcharged him for a past job, leaving him with a permanent limp and braces on his hips.
Irene has her car towed to Shannon's garage and the Driver gives her and Benicio a ride home. The Driver takes a great interest in Irene and Benicio by driving them around (down the LA river) and playing dad or ""big-brother"" to Benicio; most notably by playing the ""blinking"" game with him. The Driver begins spending more and more time with Irene and Benicio, and later meets Irene's husband, Standard (Oscar Isaac), when he comes home from prison. The Driver is devastated when he finds out Standard was coming home as it ended his dream life he had recently created with Irene and Benicio. The night he finds out he goes for a drive alone to a cheap diner and threatens a former client who attempts to use his driving services again. Standard owes protection money to an Albanian gangster, Cook (James Biberi), from his time in prison. Cook beats up Standard and threatens to go after Irene and Benicio if Standard does not agree to rob a pawn shop to pay the debt.
The Driver agrees to help Standard pay off the debt by driving him to and from the pawn shop. Blanche (Christina Hendricks), Cook's moll, also participates in the heist. The Driver uses a slim-jim to open and steal a car for the job. While waiting in the parking lot for Standard and Blanche to complete the heist, the Driver sees another car pull into the lot and park. Blanche returns to the car with a large bag. But when Standard leaves the pawn shop, he is shot in the neck by the owner, unseen from inside the shop, and falls to the ground. The Pawn owner then proceeds to come outside and finish the injured Standard off with multiple shots to the back. The Driver flees with Blanche and the money, but the car that pulled into the parking lot minutes earlier gives chase, trying to run them off the road. The Driver eludes the other vehicle and they hide out in a motel room. The Driver discovers that the amount of money is much more than was expected (1,000,000 instead of the expected 40,000). After the Driver threatens Blanche, she tells him that the chasing car belongs to Cook and that she and Cook planned to double-cross the Driver and Standard, taking the money for themselves. Two of Cook's men attack them in the motel room, killing Blanche and injuring the Driver before he kills them both.
The Driver confronts Cook in his strip club and learns that Nino was behind the heist. He offers to give Nino his money back, but Nino declines and instead sends a hitman (Jeff Wolfe) to the Driver's apartment building, with whom the Driver and Irene unknowingly ride the elevator. The Driver gives Irene a kiss before killing the hitman by repeatedly stomping on his head, to her horror. Nino explains to Bernie that the money from the pawn shop belonged to the East Coast mafia. Fearing retaliation, Bernie and Nino agree to kill those with knowledge, starting with Cook. Bernie confronts Shannon in his garage and reluctantly kills him with a straight razor, after Shannon refuses to divulge information on the whereabouts of the Driver.
The Driver, wearing a silicone mask disguise from his job as a stunt double, follows Nino to the Pacific Coast Highway in his car and T-Bones Nino's car onto a beach. With Nino wounded and weakened, the Driver drowns him in the Pacific Ocean. The Driver speaks to Bernie on Nino's phone and they arrange to meet at a Chinese restaurant. The Driver makes a final phone call to Irene to tell her he is leaving, and says that meeting her and Benicio was the best thing that has ever happened to him. At the restaurant, Bernie promises only Irene and Benicio's safety, in exchange for the money, but warns the Driver that he cannot guarantee the safety of the Driver himself. In the parking lot, Bernie stabs the Driver in the abdomen as he pulls the money from the trunk of his car. The Driver fatally stabs Bernie in the neck, leaving his corpse and the satchel of money behind. Before he pulls out the audience is in the dark as to whether the Driver is dead or not. It turns out the Driver is playing the ""blinking game"" with himself and after he blinks he drives away. That evening, Irene knocks on the Driver's apartment door, with no response. The Driver drives off into the night.","cool,garmin,getaway,joy,sat nav,get away,stunt,getaway driver,navigation,nav,gps,navman,wheelman",3811.jpg,2011-05-20, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/drive/id492170756?uo=4,lDO_OtAwV8s,70189289,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Drive/70189289,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

3818,Drowned Out,"Shot over three years by renowned documentary director Franny Armstrong (The Age of Stupid, McLibel), Drowned Out tells the true story of an Indian family who decide to stay at home and drown rather than make way for the Narmada Dam. With just a few weeks until the village disappears underwater, bestselling author Arundhati Roy (The God of Small Things) joins the family's fight against the dam. She asks the difficult questions. Will the water go to poor farmers or to rich industrialists? Why are children dying in the resettlement sites? What happened to the 16 million people displaced by fifty years of dam building? Why should we care? Drowned Out follows the villagers through hunger strikes, rallies, police brutality and a six year Supreme Court case. It stays with them as the dam fills and the river starts to rise. According to the Royal Gazette newspaper in Bermuda, """"Documentaries rarely, if ever, come better than this"""". Film Journal International called it """"a real eye opener"""" and the San Francisco Film Festival said that it is """"a film of enormous heart, grit and insight, that is both taut political essay and enormously moving plea."""" The film's producers estimate that Drowned Out has so far been seen by more than 14 million people worldwide.","The documentary follows the villagers of Jalsindhi ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a village in Madhya Pradesh on the banks of the Narmada River about 10 miles upstream from the Sardar Sarovar project - through their battle against the dam. The lead character is Luharia Sonkaria, who is the village‚Äö√Ñ√¥s medicine man, a role that was his father‚Äö√Ñ√¥s and grandfather‚Äö√Ñ√¥s before him. The government provides them no viable alternatives - they offer unusable land a hundred miles away or a small sum of money in compensation for their river-side land. The film documents hunger strikes, rallies, and a six year Supreme Court case, and finally follows the villagers as the dam fills and the river starts to rise. The documentary features Arundhati Roy, who has been an outspoken activist bringing international attention to the controversy.",,3818.jpg,2002-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/drowned-out/id457781690?uo=4,,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"
2893,Duck Soup,"A pointed political satire, Duck Soup is the Marx Brothers' funniest and most insane film. Groucho is Rufus T. Firefly, the hilarious dictator of mythical Freedonia. Harpo and Chico are commissioned as spies by Groucho's political rival, the calculating Trentino (Louis Calhern). The film contains many of the Brothers' famous sequences: the lemonade stand, a masterpiece of slow burn; the Paul Revere parody; the ""We're Going To War"" number, a beautiful spoof of '30s musicals; the hilarious mirror scene; and a final battle episode that has been copied by everyone from Woody Allen to Mad Magazine.","The wealthy Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont) insists that Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) be appointed leader of the small, bankrupt country of Freedonia before she will continue to provide much-needed financial backing. Meanwhile, neighboring Sylvania is attempting to take over the country. Sylvanian ambassador Trentino (Louis Calhern) tries to foment a revolution, woos Mrs. Teasdale, and attempts to dig up dirt on Firefly by sending in spies Chicolini (Chico Marx) and Pinky (Harpo Marx).
After failing to collect worthwhile information about Firefly, Chicolini and Pinky infiltrate the government when Chicolini is appointed Secretary of War after Firefly sees him on the street selling peanuts. Meanwhile, Firefly's personal assistant, Bob Roland (Zeppo Marx) suspects Trentino's questionable motives, and counsels Firefly to ""get rid of that man at once"" by saying ""something to make him mad, and he'll strike you, and we'll force him to leave the country."" Firefly agrees to the plan, but after a series of personal insults exchanged between Firefly and Trentino, the plan backfires and Firefly slaps Trentino instead. As a result, the two countries reach the brink of war. Adding to the international friction is the fact that Firefly is also wooing Mrs. Teasdale, and likewise hoping to get his hands on her late husband's wealth.
Trentino learns that Freedonia's war plans are in Mrs. Teasdale's possession and orders Chicolini and Pinky to steal them. Chicolini is caught by Firefly and put on trial, during which war is officially declared, and everyone is overcome by war frenzy, breaking into song and dance.

2106,Duma,"Carroll Ballard (The Black Stallion, Fly Away Home) directs the exciting story of 12-year-old Xan (Alexander Michaletos), who decides to return the cheetah he raised from a cub to the wild instead of allowing pursuers to place it in captivity. Harsh South African landscapes, stalking lions, crocodiles, river rapids and a mysterious drifter (Eamonn Walker) who may intend to turn the big cat in for cash - all will test Xan's courage and resolve. Join him in this tale of growing up and letting go. It's a journey you won't want to miss.","Set in the country of South Africa, the story begins with a cheetah cub being orphaned after his mother was killed by lions. The cub is found on the side of the road by a young boy named Xan (Alexander Michaeletos) and his father Peter (Campbell Scott). Initially reluctant to take in a wild animal, Peter agrees to let Xan take care of the cub. They name him ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Duma‚Äö√Ñ√π, the Swahili name for ‚Äö√Ñ√∫cheetah‚Äö√Ñ√π. Over the years, Duma becomes a part of the family, being closely raised by Xan. As he nears adulthood, Peter and Xan decide to teach Duma how to run by having him chase alongside Peter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s motorcycle, which can barely keep up with him. But with Duma almost fully grown, to Xan‚Äö√Ñ√¥s dismay, his father tells him that it is time to take his friend to his real home before he grows too old to survive in his native habitat. His father says to Xan, ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Duma has to live the life he was born to ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ or he‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll never be fully alive.‚Äö√Ñ√π
Xan reluctantly agrees, but their plans must be put on hold when his father suddenly falls ill and dies and Xan and his mother (Hope Davis) must move to Johannesburg. Duma comes with them, which wreaks havoc on their life in the city. Xan‚Äö√Ñ√¥s aunt is terrified of Duma, who likes to sneak up and surprise her, and when Duma escapes and pays a disastrous visit to Xan‚Äö√Ñ√¥s school, the two of them must flee the city to keep Duma from being put into captivity. Not knowing where to go, Xan gets an idea ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ he‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll carry out the plan his dad had outlined, taking Duma home in the neighbouring country of Botswana, over the scorching Makgadikgadi Salt Pans, through the Okavango Delta and into the Erongo Mountains.
Xan begins to drive to his destination in his father‚Äö√Ñ√¥s old motorcycle, with Duma in the sidecar. After running out of fuel and water in the grasslands, they find some shade underneath a crashed airplane. There, they are confronted by Ripkuna (Eamonn Walker), a mysterious drifter on a journey of his own. While Xan isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t at all that sure he can trust Rip, he agrees to go with him. Xan manages to turn the immobile motorcycle into a desert sailboat out of a parachute from the plane wreck, and Xan, Rip and Duma are on their way again, until they encounter the untraversable scrub brush of the Kalahari Desert and must abandon the motorcycle. While trying to find shelter, Rip is trapped in an abandoned diamond mine by a cave in, and Xan decides to leave him, as he suspects that he has been leading him to town instead of the jungle to sell Duma and collect a reward for finding him. However, when Duma is caught in a trap and Xan is knocked unconscious by a boar, Rip rescues both of them, having escaped the mine through a ventilation shaft.
Soon, they reach the Okavango Delta, where Xan is set upon by the deadly wildlife and the churning rapids of the Thamalakane River, but it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s too late for him to turn back now. Xan, Rip and Duma press through the Okavango, and finally the Erongo Mountains, on the border of Botswana and Namibia are in sight. However, once they get there, Xan is suddenly set upon by a swarm of tsetse flies. To protect him from their lethal bite, Rip huddles over Xan and is bitten by hundreds of flies. He soon develops sleeping sickness, and Xan takes him to a nearby village where he can be cared for. Later that night, outside the village, Duma is out on his own and starts calling out into the mountains. Duma finds another cheetah calling to him, and they bond rather quickly. It is never explained whether this is another male cheetah, or is in fact one of Duma's siblings. Xan hears this activity, and realizes that this is where he and Duma must part. Xan says goodbye to Duma, and Duma comes to Xan and says a final goodbye, and goes back to play with his new friend. Then Xan goes back to the village to Rip. Before the credits, it shows Xan being reunited with his mother.","parents,advernturer,rescue,children,escapades,escape,captivating,xan,sister,adventure,friends,family,pets,friendship,rapids,africa,animal,sentimental,youth,siblings,crocodiles,touching,pet,brother,lions,atmospheric,bittersweet,river",2106.jpg,2005-04-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/duma/id291179885?uo=4,,70001230,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Duma/70001230,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Kids & Family"
743,Dumbo,"The inspirational tale of Dumbo, the courageous baby elephant who uses his sensational ears to soar to fame with the help of his clever best friend Timothy Q. Mouse, will thrill and delight audiences of all ages. And now, the award-winning music and empowering messages about friendship and belief in yourself. The stork delivers a baby elephant to Mrs Jumbo, veteran of the circus, but the newborn is ridiculed because of his truly enormous ears and dubbed ""Dumbo"". Dumbo is relegated to the circus' clown acts; it is up to his only friend, a mouse, to assist Dumbo to achieve his full potential. ","While circus animals are being transported, Mrs. Jumbo, one of the elephants, receives her baby from a stork. The baby elephant is quickly taunted by the other elephants because of his large ears, and they nickname him ""Dumbo"".
Once the circus is set up, Mrs. Jumbo loses her temper at a group of boys for making fun of her son, so she is locked up and deemed mad. Dumbo is shunned by the other elephants and with no mother to care for him, he is now alone. Timothy Q. Mouse, who feels sympathy for Dumbo and becomes determined to make him happy again, appoints himself as Dumbo's mentor and protector.
The circus director makes Dumbo the top of an elephant pyramid stunt, but Dumbo trips over his ears and misses his target, injuring the other elephants and bringing down the big top. Dumbo is made a clown as a result, and plays the main role in an act that involves him falling into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity and fame, Dumbo hates this job and is now more miserable than ever.
To cheer Dumbo up, Timothy takes him to visit his mother. On the way back Dumbo cries and then starts to hiccup, so Timothy takes him for a drink of water from a bucket which, unknown to them, has accidentally had a bottle of champagne knocked into it. As a result, Dumbo and Timothy both become drunk and see hallucinations of pink elephants.
The next morning, Dumbo and Timothy wake up in a tree. Timothy wonders how they got up in the tree, and concludes that Dumbo flew up there using his large ears as wings. With the help of a group of crows, Timothy is able to get Dumbo to fly again, using a psychological trick of a ""magic feather"" to boost his confidence.
Back at the circus, Dumbo must perform his stunt of jumping from a high building, this time from a much higher platform. On the way down, Dumbo loses the feather; Timothy quickly tells him that the feather was never magical, and that he is still able to fly. Dumbo is able to pull out of the dive and flies around the circus, finally striking back at his tormentors as the stunned audience looks on in amazement.
After this performance, Dumbo becomes a media sensation, Timothy becomes his manager, and Dumbo and Mrs. Jumbo are given a private car on the circus train.","heroes,sad,rescue,award,good,danger,friends,misfit,family,friendship,anticipation,belief,musical,floopy ears,animation,dumbo,youth,disney,disorder,fly,soar,friend,different,babies,parents,mouse,sadness,elephant,joy,children,escapades,bigears,escape,flying,adventure,infants,classic,animal,miracle,big ears,funny,humorous,young,touching,oddone,ears,feel good,misfits,circus",743.jpg,1941-10-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/dumbo/id453118424?uo=4,22v-1eMIl40,60010304,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Dumbo/60010304,"Animation,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
1171,Duplicity,"Ray works for MI6, Claire for the CIA. She burns him in Dubai. Jump ahead five years: he sees her in Grand Central and confronts her. Both now work in industrial security for corporate giants whose CEOs hate each other. Flashbacks fill us in: is it coincidence that he sees her in Grand Central? In about a week, one of the firms is going to announce a revolutionary product. Under the guise of helping that corporation's rival, can Ray and Claire work their own theft and find an independent buyer? To work together, using the corporate rivalry to their advantage, they would have to trust one another - difficult, if not impossible. Or, is one playing the other?","The film opens five years before the present day, showing the Fourth of July celebration at the American consulate in Dubai, where Ray Koval (Clive Owen), an MI6 agent, appears to seduce Claire Stenwick (Julia Roberts), who, unbeknownst to him, is a CIA agent. Claire drugs Ray and steals classified documents from him.

In the present day, Ray is now a corporate spy in New York City who recently went to work for Equikrom. At a meet, he spots Claire and thinks the mission is blown. Ray follows her and confronts her about the incident in Dubai. Claire puts on an innocent act, pretending she has never met Ray, until they both realize they were supposed to meet. Claire has been working undercover for Equikrom at Burkett & Randle for the past 14 months, and Ray is to be her new handler.
At Burkett & Randle a major development is underfoot, and Tully makes a speech that paints them as innovators defending themselves from duplicity and theft. At Equikrom, Garsik obtains a copy of the speech through Claire and plots to steal whatever Burkett & Randle has developed.
The scene cuts to two years earlier in Rome, where we see Ray and Claire again meeting for the ""first"" time since Dubai, replaying the same dialog as in NYC. The audience learns that Ray and Claire did not meet at Equikrom by chance--they plan to cheat both companies and sell a corporate secret to the highest bidder. However, neither still completely trusts the other, nor knows who is playing whom.
The team at Equikrom believes Ronny Partiz (Denham), a child prodigy turned genius, might be responsible for Burkett & Randle's new product. Ray and Boris Fetyov (Oleg Stefan) stake out Partiz at a casino in the Bahamas, where Claire and Jeff Bauer (Thomas McCarthy) from Burkett & Randle foil their plans by planting evidence of them cheating the casino.
In return, Tully at Burkett & Randle thanks Claire for successfully defending the company's new product, revealing it to be a cure for baldness. When Bauer is later caught attempting to steal the formula and Claire is left guarding him and the formula by herself, she uses one of the rigged photocopiers at Burkett & Randle to transfer it to Equikrom.
Back at Equikrom, Claire accuses Ray of stealing the formula for himself. He is searched and exposed when it is found. Claire waits at the Z‚àö¬∫rich airport in Switzerland and when Ray arrives, it is revealed that Claire and Ray were only putting on an act at Equikrom. Each pretends at first they don't have the formula and then Claire confesses she loves Ray and says they are each the only one who can ever understand the other. Claire proposes they each reveal what they have on the count of three but Ray says he loves Claire back by saying first that he had another copy of the formula. Claire admits that she had it too, creating real trust for the first time.
Ray and Claire attempt to sell the formula to a Swiss company for $35 million. Meanwhile, Garsik tells his shareholders that they are in the final stages of testing for a product that cures baldness. The Swiss, however, say the formula is a fraud. The scene cuts to ten days earlier, where Claire and Ray were practicing the act they would present when it was revealed that Ray would be Claire's handler. Unbeknownst to them, there was a hidden microphone in their room monitoring them. From the beginning, Claire and Ray were being played by Tully and his people. Pam Frailes (Kathleen Chalfant) from Equikrom was really working for Burkett & Randle all along, Partiz was used as the bait, Bauer staged stealing the formula, and the formula never existed at all. It was all a trick to get Garsik to announce he had a revolutionary product, which was in fact just a regular skin cream, and which would ruin Garsik and Equikrom. The film ends with Ray and Claire realizing they have been played by Tully.","witty,stylized,romance,love,affair,sexy,dishonesty,espionage,intrigue,couple,anticipation,cons,trust,undercover,suspense,humorous,couples,rivalry,manipulations,suspenseful,crime,secret,clever,coiple,scams,fear",1171.jpg,2009-03-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/duplicity/id319456730?uo=4,aGtUiVSD19g,70109692,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Duplicity/70109692,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
151,Eagle Eye,"""Eagle Eye"" is a race-against-time thriller starring Shia LaBeouf, Michelle Monaghan, Rosario Dawson, Anthony Mackie, Michael Chiklis and Billy Bob Thornton. Two unsuspecting Americans are separately drawn into a conspiracy by a mysterious woman they have never met, but who seems to know their every move. By the time they discover her frightening identity, they have become her unwitting accomplices in a diabolical assassination plot.","Jerry Shaw (Shia LaBeouf) is a Stanford University dropout who learns that his identical twin brother Ethan, a US Air Force first lieutenant, has been killed. Following the funeral, Jerry is surprised to find $750,000 in his bank account. He later finds his apartment filled with weapons, ammonium nitrate, classified DOD documents, and forged passports. He receives a phone call from a woman who says the FBI is about to arrest him and that he needs to run.
Disbelieving, Jerry is caught by the FBI and interrogated by Supervising Agent Tom Morgan (Billy Bob Thornton). While Morgan is conferring with Air Force OSI Special Agent Zoe P‚àö¬©rez (Rosario Dawson), the woman on the phone arranges for Jerry's escape and directs him to Rachel Holloman (Michelle Monaghan), a single mother. The woman on the phone is coercing Rachel by threatening her son Sam (Cameron Boyce), who is en route to the Kennedy Center with his school band. The woman on the phone helps the two avoid the Chicago police and FBI, with the ability to control networked devices, including traffic lights, mobile phones, automated cranes, and even power lines.
Meanwhile, the woman on the phone redirects a powerful DOD crystalline explosive (hexamethylene) to a gemcutter who cuts and fits it to a necklace. Another man (Anthony Azizi) is manipulated into stealing Sam's trumpet from Chicago and fitting the crystal's sonic trigger into the piping before forwarding it to Sam in Washington, D.C.
Agent Perez is summoned by Secretary of Defense George Callister (Michael Chiklis) to be read into Ethan's job at the Pentagon. Ethan monitored the DOD's top secret intelligence-gathering supercomputer, the Autonomous Reconnaissance Intelligence Integration Analyst (ARIIA; voiced by Julianne Moore). Callister leaves Perez with Major William Bowman (Anthony Mackie) and ARIIA to sort out the Ethan Shaw investigation. Simultaneously, Rachel and Jerry learn that their mysterious woman is actually ARIIA, and she has ""activated"" them under the Constitution's authorization to recruit civilians for the national defense.
Perez and Bowman find evidence Ethan Shaw hid in ARIIA's chamber the night he died. After they leave to debrief Secretary Callister, ARIIA smuggles Jerry and Rachel into her observation theater under the Pentagon. Both groups learn that after her recommendation was ignored and a botched operation in Balochistan resulted in the deaths of American citizens, ARIIA concluded that ""to prevent more bloodshed, the executive branch must be removed."" Acting on behalf of ""We the People"", and citing the Declaration of Independence (""whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it""), ARIAA acted in compliance with Section 216 of the Patriot Act which ""allows us to circumvent probable cause in the face of a national security threat, in this case, the chain of command itself.""
Too late realized, Jerry has been brought by ARIIA to circumvent biometric locks his twin placed to prevent the system from realizing Operation Guillotine, a military simulation of how to keep the government running with the loss of all presidential successors. Because of Secretary Callister's concurrence with ARIIA's abort recommendation regarding Balochistan, he has been chosen as the designated survivor after the hexamethylene detonates at the State of the Union address (SOTU).
One of ARIIA's agents (Nick Searcy) extracts Rachel from the Pentagon and gives her a dress and the hexamethylene necklace to wear to the SOTU. Sam's school band has also been redirected to the United States Capitol to play for the president, bringing the trigger in Sam's trumpet and the explosive together. Jerry is recaptured by Agent Morgan, who has become convinced of Jerry's innocence. Though Morgan sacrifices himself to stop an armed MQ-9 Reaper sent by ARIIA, he first gives Jerry his weapon and ID with which to gain entrance to the Capitol. Arriving in the House Chamber, Jerry fires the handgun in the air to disrupt the concert before being shot and wounded by the Secret Service.
Days later, Secretary Callister reports that ARIIA has been decommissioned and that he recommends against building another; the Shaw twins, and Agents Perez and Morgan receive awards for their actions; and in the final scene, Jerry attends Sam's birthday party, earning thanks and a kiss from Rachel.","technology,conspiracy,mystery,chases,agents,fugitive,imaginary,stylized,race,identity,computers,time,susepenseful,thriller,action,investigation,mind,anticipation,law,chaos,trust,hollywood,web,suspense,game,exciting,accomplice,suspenseful,assassination,fear",151.jpg,2008-09-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/eagle-eye/id295913878?uo=4,_wkqo_Rd3_Q,70098611,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Eagle_Eye/70098611,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
1093,Earth Days,Earth Days traces the origins of the modern environmental movement through the eyes of nine Americans who propelled the movement from its beginnings in the 1950s to its moment of triumph in 1970 with the original Earth Day and to its status as a major political force in America.,"The story of our growing awareness and understanding of the environmental crisis and emergence, during the 1960's and '70's, of popular movement to confront it.

Robert Stone's 'Earth Days'is a non preachy documentary on the history of Earth Day,since the first one back in 1970,that pointed out that we should start to step back & do a serious re-thing on our role as citizens of Mother Earth. The film has some real nice footage of some of the finest names in environmental concerns today (Paul Erlich,Pete McCloskey,Dennis Hayes, Dennis Meadows,and Rachel Carson,author of the now legendary pro environmental book,'The Silent Spring',and others). The documentary also gets kudos for vintage film clips of both pro,as well as anti environmental films (the black & white footage from an episode of 'Face The Nation' is a hoot in itself). If you care about the future of our planet you owe it to yourself to seek this fine documentary out.

328,East of Eden,"Based on the classic John Steinbeck novel, this Academy Award-winning film features the starring debut of movie idol and legend James Dean (""Rebel Without A Cause,"" ""Giant"") in this riveting drama revolving around two brothers' love for the same woman. Co-starring Emmy-winner Julie Harris (""Knots Landing,"" ""Harper"") and Jo Van Fleet (who won an Oscar as their mother) and winner of The Golden Globe Award for Best Picture of 1955. Recently selected by the prestigious American Film Institute as one of the 400 greatest American films of all time.","The story is set in 1917, before and during American involvement in World War I, in the central California coastal towns of Monterey and Salinas. Cal (James Dean) and Aron (Richard Davalos) are the sons of a modestly successful farmer and wartime draft board chairman named Adam Trask (Raymond Massey). Cal is moody and embittered by his belief that his father favors Aron. Although both Cal and Aron had long been led to believe that their mother had died ""and gone to heaven"", the opening scene reveals that Cal has apparently learned that his mother is still alive, owning and running a successful brothel in nearby Monterey.
After the father's idealistic plans for a long-haul vegetable shipping business venture end in a loss of thousands of dollars, Cal decides to enter the bean-growing business, as a way of recouping the money his father lost in the vegetable shipping venture. He is advised that if the United States enters the war, the price of beans will skyrocket. Cal hopes this will finally earn him the love and respect of his father. He goes to his mother Kate (Jo Van Fleet) to ask to borrow the capital he needs. She reluctantly lends him $5,000.
Meanwhile, Aron's girlfriend Abra (Julie Harris) gradually finds herself attracted to Cal, who seems to reciprocate her feelings.
Cal's business goes well, and he decides to give the money to Adam at a surprise birthday party for his father, which he and Abra plan together. As the party gets underway, Aron suddenly announces that he and Abra are engaged. While Adam is openly pleased with the news, both Abra and Cal are uneasy, having recently discovered a mutual attraction for one another is emerging, despite their suppressed feelings. Cal makes a surprise birthday present of the money to his father; however, Adam refuses to accept any money earned by what he regards as war profiteering. Cal does not understand, and sees his father's refusal to accept the gift as just another emotional rejection. When the distraught Cal leaves the room, Abra goes after him, to console him as best she can. Aron follows and orders Cal to stay away from her.
In anger, Cal takes his brother to see their mother, then returns home alone. When his father demands to know where his brother is, Cal tells him. The shock drives Aron to get drunk and board a troop train to enlist in the army. When Sam (Burl Ives), the sheriff, brings the news, Adam rushes to the train station in an attempt to dissuade him, but can only watch helplessly as his son steams away from him with his head out the rail car window, maniacally laughing at him.
Adam suffers a stroke because of the incredible strain, leaving him paralyzed and unable to communicate. Cal and Abra enter the bedroom. Cal tries to talk to him, but gets no response and leaves the bedroom leaving Abra alone with Adam. Abra pleads with Adam to show Cal some affection before it is too late. She persuades Cal to go back into the room. When Cal makes his last bid for acceptance before leaving town, his father manages to speak. He tells his son to get rid of the annoying nurse and not to get anyone else, but to stay and take care of him himself.","less...,sentimental,more...,sincere,emotional,touching,tense,atmospheric,bittersweet,captivating,gloomy",328.jpg,1955-03-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/east-of-eden/id292043107?uo=4,tdMjKq8xk-E,,,"Classics,Drama"
794,East/West (Est-Ouest),"From the director of Academy Award(r)-winning INDOCHINE comes another highly acclaimed film. Academy Award(r)-nominated (1999) for Best Foreign Language Film, EAST/WEST (EST/OUEST) is a wonderfully imagined film that follows the plight of a young couple and their child as they choose to go back to the Soviet Union in 1946. At the end of the war, Stalin invited Russians who fled the country to return.The talented young doctor, Alexe‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö‚â§ Golovine (Oleg Menchikov), accompanied by his French bride, the beautiful Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire), and their son optimistically return to the Soviet Union. Their arrival is a rude one. Interrogations are followed by the grim reality of post-war Soviet Union: shared apartments, suspicious neighbors and lack of privacy. Marie soon starts to rebel against the circumstances, but her husband finds that his talents are needed and appreciated by the authorities so he starts to get ahead. Marie meets up with a touring French actress (Catherine Deneuve), and soon faces a terrifying choice: to leave her husband and child for freedom or stay and confront a grim future.","After the Second World War, former White Emigres are offered Soviet citizenship, amnesty, and an invitation to return to the Motherland, so that they could join in the post-war restructuring. While most of the ‚àö¬©migr‚àö¬©s decide to remain abroad, there are many people anxious to return to the ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Holy Russia‚Äö√Ñ√¥. Among the returnees are Alexei Golovin (Oleg Menshikov), his French wife Marie (Sandrine Bonnaire) and their son Sergey. But Joseph Stalin's offer was merely a tactical step.
On arrival in Odessa, many of their travelling companions are executed on the spot or sent to the Gulag. Alexei and his family escape this fate and are sent to Kiev simply because the Soviet authorities realise that they have much to gain from this young doctor. He will be paraded as an example, a model ""returnee"". This is the price Alexei has to pay to save Marie and Seriozha.
He is posted to the infirmary of a textile factory and he and his family are allocated a single room in a communal apartment. The ""kommunalka"" is to become Marie's new home, where a complete lack of privacy, denunciations from neighbors and NKVD arrest raids are a reality of daily life. Despite the strength of their marriage, Alexei and Marie gradually grow apart. Alexei conforms, accepts, and bides his time. Marie, however, refuses, bridles and has one sole aim: to return to France. But all her attempts are blocked by Alexei.
When a French theatre group, led by the famous actress, Gabrielle Develay (Catherine Deneuve), arrives in Kiev on tour, Marie knows that this is her chance to alert the French Government. Marie manages to get through to Gabrielle and hand her a letter. When they get home, Marie throws Alexei out of their apartment, unable to bear his submissiveness to Stalin or his infidelity any longer.
Marie finds a solace in her seventeen-year-old neighbor, Sasha (Sergei Bodrov Jr.), a competitive swimmer whose ability has kept him out of military service. Even after being thrown off the team, Sasha continues training, thanks to Marie's efforts. Every day, she takes him down to the river to swim alone against the current. Marie and Sasha share one wild hope: that he will get back and win selection for the European championships in Vienna. Once there, Sasha will be able to defect to the West, but it will be freedom without Marie, whom he loves. Marie is resolute, however. He must go, for freedom is what is the most important.
Sasha wins the national race but falls under NKVD suspicion and is still not selected for Vienna. He is sent to a training camp on the Black Sea, to remove him from Marie's ""dangerous"" influence. Alone and despondent, Marie reunites with Alexei.
Sasha, however, refuses to give up, escapes from his training camp, and swims 10 nautical miles (19 km) to a Turkish freighter. When his story explodes across the Western news media, the Soviet authorities are enraged. Despite Alexei's attempts to save her, Marie is arrested by the NKVD and confesses under torture to masterminding Sasha's defection as part of a Central Intelligence Agency plot. She is then sentenced to a long term in the Gulag.
Six years later, during the Khrushchev thaw, Alexei succeeds in overturning Marie's conviction. She is released, a broken and traumatized woman who no longer hopes for anything. Through Alexei's nursing and love, she slowly comes out of her shell.
Two years later, while acompanying a trade mission to Bulgaria, Alexei finally lays his cards on the table. Gabrielle is waiting in the lobby to take her and Seriozha to the French embassy. ""I have been waiting ten years for this,"" he says. Marie is overcome with emotion and pleads with him to come along. Alexei sadly responds, ""The Embassy will protect you, but I am a Soviet citizen.""
Marie and Seriozha flee from the hotel and are barely saved from arrest by Bulgarian police. When Gabrielle informs her that she is now on French soil, Marie faints, calling out her husband's name.
An epilogue reveals that, amidst an international uproar, Marie and Seriozha were exfiltrated across the Greek-Bulgarian border. Alexei is seen walking aboard the train back to Kiev smiling at the knowledge that his family was free. We learn that he was sent as a doctor to the Gulag camp of Sakhalin Island and allowed only in 1987 to join his family in France.",,794.jpg,1999-09-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/east-west/id539943741?uo=4,,60002463,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/East_West/60002463,"Art House & International,Drama,Romance"

The Russian descendant midwife Anna Khitrova finds Tatiana's diary written in Russian language in her belongings and decided to find her family to deliver the baby, she brings the diary home and ask her uncle Stepan to translate the document. Stepan refuses, but Anna finds a card of a restaurant owned by the Russian Semyon inside the diary and she visits the old man trying to find a lead to contact Tatiana's family. When she mentions the existence of the diary, Semyon immediately offers to translate the document. However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill had raped Tatiana when she was fourteen years old and forced her to work as prostitute in a brothel of their own. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia ""Vory v Zakone"", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family. Meanwhile, Semyon's driver Nikolai Luzhin gets close to Kirill and Semyon, climbing positions in the criminal organization, but he helps Anna, her family and the baby. ","Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts), a British-Russian midwife at a London hospital, finds a Russian-language diary on the body of Tatiana, a 14-year-old girl who dies in childbirth. She also finds a card for the Trans-Siberian restaurant, which is owned by Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl), an old vor in the Russian Mafia. Anna thus sets out to track down the girl's family so that she can find a home for the baby girl, having meetings with Semyon who she initially regards as friendly. Anna's mother Helen (Sin‚àö¬©ad Cusack) does not discourage her, but Anna's Ukrainian uncle and self-described former KGB officer, Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski), whom Anna asks for help with the translation of the diary, urges caution.

Ultimately Anna realises that the baby was fathered by Semyon.
Semyon's driver is Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen), who also serves as the family cleaner, dumping murdered bodies in the River Thames. Through Nikolai, Semyon, fearing prosecution, promises to give the location of the girl's family to Anna if she hands back the diary. Nikolai takes the diary but does not give a location, instead later urging Anna to keep the baby in the UK as the girl's home is a bad village to grow up in. Semyon distrusts Anna's uncle Stepan due to his former position and ethnicity, ordering a hit on him. Nikolai accepts and soon Stepan goes missing. As Nikolai's star rises within the vory, an impressed Semyon sponsors him as a full member, with the appropriate tattoos, due in part to Nikolai's protection of Semyon's incompetent son who authorized a hit on a rival Chechen vory leader with the help of a Kurdish associate, Azim. The hit was not approved by Semyon and was ill-advised as the Chechen gang soon arrive to London seeking vengeance and kill Azim's nephew who had also been involved in the hit. Semyon hatches a plan to trick Nikolai into temporarily taking Kirill's place during a meeting at the baths with Azim. The Chechens attack, thinking Nikolai is Kirill, but Nikolai kills them both and ends up in hospital with severe wounds as a result.
It is then revealed that Nikolai is actually an FSB agent who has infiltrated the gang, working under license by the British Government and a Senior Officer (Rhodri Wyn Miles). As part of his undercover duties, Nikolai was able to read Tatiana's diary before Semyon had it destroyed and hatched a plan to have Semyon arrested for statutory rape, with a paternity test of the Tatiana's baby as evidence. Stepan is also safe, hiding in a 5-star hotel in Edinburgh for protection. Semyon orders Kirill to kidnap the baby girl and kill her but as Kirill sits by the Thames, almost unable to throw the little girl into the river, Nikolai and Anna find him and persuade him to give the baby back. Nikolai and Kirill embrace as Nikolai tells him that his father is finished and they are now the bosses. Nikolai and Anna then kiss as they part for the last time. Nikolai succeeds Semyon's place as boss of the organization and Anna gains custody of Tatiana's baby, whom she raises as Christine.","bleak,disturbing,suspenseful,tense,stylized,rough,captivating",944.jpg,2007-09-08, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/eastern-promises/id274244644?uo=4,iq_M8EOC4zA,70059994,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Eastern_Promises/70059994,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
3368,Easy A,"Nathaniel Hawthorne's The Scarlet Letter is re-imagined as a contemporary high school comedy in this tale of a scheming student who plots to give her popularity a boost by painting herself the easiest lay in school. Like most high school kids, Olive Penderghast (Emma Stone) just wants to be popular. So much so than when her best friend, Rhiannon (Aly Michalka), asks Olive how her weekend went, the bored teen decides to whip up a spicy white lie just to make things interesting. But that minor exaggeration begins to take on a life of its own when it reaches the ears of motor-mouth gossip Jesus freak Marianne (Amanda Bynes), and in no time the entire student body is abuzz over unassuming Olive's unrepentant weekend of debauchery. Of course not a word of it is true, but that doesn't stop everyone in school from talking, and an amused Olive from deciding to go with the flow. Playing the role of the hussy to the hilt, the girl who used to be invisible begins dressing provocatively and turning heads in the hallways. The students aren't the only ones taking notice, either; Olive's English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church), is concerned that the kind of attention she's receiving isn't healthy for a developing girl, and his wife (Lisa Kudrow), the school guidance counselor, is in full agreement. The only people who seem remotely interested in the truth are Olive's trusting and open-minded parents (Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson). As Olive takes note of the parallels between her own situation and the plight of the Scarlet Letter heroine Hester Prynne, she realizes that she may be able to manipulate her newfound notoriety to give fellow classmate Brandon's (Dan Byrd) popularity a much-needed shot in the arm. Olive never thought her little game could possibly have any negative effect on anyone but herself, but when loose lips start sinking ships all around her, she realizes that it's high time for the truth to come out.","Olive Penderghast lies to her best friend Rhiannon Abernathy about going on a date in order to get out of camping with Rhi's hippie parents. Instead, she hangs around the house all weekend listening to Natasha Bedingfield's ""Pocketful of Sunshine"". The following Monday, pressed by Rhiannon, Olive lies about losing her virginity to a college guy. Marianne Bryant, a strictly religious girl at their school, overhears her telling the lie and soon it spreads like wildfire. The school's conservative church group run by Marianne decides Olive will be their next project.
Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon, and he explains how others bully him because he is gay. Brandon later asks Olive to pretend to sleep with him so that he will be accepted by everyone. Brandon convinces Olive and they pretend to have sex at a party.
After having a fight with Rhiannon over Olive's new identity as a ""dirty skank"", Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp. She begins to wear more provocative clothing and stitches a red ""A"" (similar to Hester Prynne in The Scarlet Letter) to everything she wears. Boys who usually have had no luck with girls in the past beg Olive to say they have had sex with her in order to increase their own popularity, in exchange for money, in turn increasing her reputation.
Things get worse when Micah, Marianne's 22-year-old boyfriend, contracts chlamydia from sleeping with Mrs. Griffith, the school counselor, and blames it all on Olive. Olive agrees to lie to cover up the affair so that the marriage of her favorite teacher, Mr. Griffith, would be spared. Marianne's religious clique (which Rhiannon also joined) begins harassing Olive in order to get her to leave school.
After an ill-fated date with a boy who wants to pay her to actually sleep with him, not just pretend she did, Olive reconnects with Todd, her old crush, who is also the school's mascot. Todd then tells her that he does not believe the rumors because he remembers when she lied for him when he was not ready for his first kiss years ago. Olive then begins to ask everyone she lied for to help her out by telling the truth, but Brandon and Micah have abruptly left town and everyone else is enjoying their newfound popularity and do not want the truth to get out. Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth and when Olive threatens to expose her, Mrs. Griffith rebuffs her, saying no one would believe her. Olive, out of spite, then immediately tells Mr. Griffith, who believes her and separates from Mrs. Griffith.
After a friendly talk with her eccentric, open-minded mother, Olive comes up with a plan to get everything finally out in the open. She then does a song and dance number at a school pep rally to get people's attention to watch her via web cam, where she confesses what she has done. The various boys whose reputations Olive helped improve are also shown watching. Later, Olive texts Rhiannon apologizing for lying to her. When she is finishing up her web cast, Todd comes by riding a lawnmower and tells her to come outside. She goes outside to meet him and the two are shown riding off on the lawnmower.","parents,sex,lies,witty,liar,counselor,whore,debauchery,romance,teenage,love,sacrifice,hussy,friends,dishonesty,family,truth,social,virgin,tramp,teen,spicy,virginity,humorous,fun,game,youth,take the blame,dangerous,rumor,school,popular,feel good,surprise,lie",3368.jpg,2010-09-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/easy-a/id403818939?uo=4,KNbPnqyvItk,70123920,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Easy_A/70123920,"Comedy,Romance"

At a crossroads after a divorce, Gilbert takes a year-long sabbatical from her job and steps uncharacteristically out of her comfort zone, risking everything to change her life. In her wondrous and exotic travels, she experiences the simple pleasure of nourishment by eating in Italy; the power of prayer in India, and, finally and unexpectedly, the inner peace and balance of love in Bali.  Based on an inspiring true story, Eat Pray Love proves that there really is more than one way to let yourself go and see the world.","A woman who once made it her goal in life to marry and rear a family finds her priorities suddenly shifting in Ryan Murphy and Jennifer Salt's adaptation of author Elizabeth Gilbert's best-selling memoir.

On the heels of a painful divorce, the woman who had previously looked forward to a contented life of domestic bliss sets out to seek her true destiny by traveling first to Italy, where she learns to appreciate nourishment; then to India, where she discovers the power of prayer; and finally to Bali, where she unexpectedly finds the meaning of true love. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","rediscover,whatif,prayer,unfulfillment,stylized,self,travel,drama,romance,exotic,love,honesty,risk,wondrous,affair,life,spiritual,woman,pray,divorce,india,sexual,mind,places to go,introspection,italy,bali,sentimental,trust,soul,career,sabbatical,reconnect,start,touching,peace,eat,discovery,religious,world,hope",2814.jpg,2010-08-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/eat-pray-love/id393457278?uo=4,crNaJjfY57g,70130445,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Eat_Pray_Love/70130445,Drama
1807,Ed Wood,"As Tim Burton's fantasies become more and more mechanical, here's a reminder of what he can do when he's actually fired up about the subject matter. A loose biopic about a unique anti-talent, Burton's tribute to Ed Wood - - supposedly the worst director of all time - - refuses to guffaw behind a cupped palm. Instead, it's vivacious, affectionate and vividly lensed, with Johnny Depp nailing Woods' infantile zeal, and an Oscar-nabbing Martin Landau offering a caustic but stirring Bela Lugosi.","In 1952, Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is struggling to join the film industry. Upon hearing of an announcement in Variety magazine that producer George Weiss (Mike Starr) is trying to purchase Christine Jorgensen's life story, Ed is inspired to meet Weiss in person. Weiss explains that Variety's announcement was a news leak, and it is impossible to purchase Jorgensen's rights. The producer decides to 'fictionalize' the film titled I Changed My Sex!, and ""do it without the shemale"". One day, Ed meets his longtime idol B‚àö¬©la Lugosi (Martin Landau), after spotting him trying out a casket. Ed drives B‚àö¬©la home and the two become friends. Later, Ed decides to star B‚àö¬©la in the film and convinces Weiss that he is perfect to direct I Changed My Sex! because he is a transvestite.
Ed and Weiss argue over the film's title: Weiss has already had the poster printed, which Ed changes to Glen or Glenda. The shoot finishes on Glen or Glenda, and Ed is enthusiastic that he ""wrote, directed and starred in it. Just like Orson Welles did in Citizen Kane"". Unfortunately, the film is released to critical and financial failure. Ed is unsuccessful in getting a job at Warner Bros., a producer there tells him Glen or Glenda is the worst film he has ever seen, but Ed's girlfriend, Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker), tells him that he should try financing his next film independently. Ed is unsuccessful in finding money for Bride of the Atom, but is introduced to the psychic The Amazing Criswell (Jeffery Jones).
At a bar, Ed meets Loretta King (Juliet Landau), who he thinks has enough money to fund Bride of the Atom and ends up casting her as the lead instead of Dolores as originally planned. Filming begins, but is halted. Ed convinces meat packing industry tycoon Don McCoy (Rance Howard) to take over funding the film. McCoy does so, but on the condition that the film ends with a giant nuclear explosion, and that his son Tony is the leading man. The filming of Bride of the Atom finishes, with the title being changed to Bride of the Monster, but Dolores and Ed break up after the wrap party, because of Ed's circle of friends and transvestism. Also, B‚àö¬©la, who is revealed to be highly depressed and a morphine addict, attempts to conduct a double suicide with Ed, but is talked out of it. B‚àö¬©la checks himself into rehab, and Ed finds love when he meets Kathy O'Hara (Patricia Arquette), who is visiting her father at the same hospital. Ed takes her on a date and reveals to her his transvestism, which she accepts.
Ed begins to shoot a film with B‚àö¬©la outside his home. When Ed and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, to which an angry mob chases them out of the theater. Sometime later, B‚àö¬©la passes away, leaving Ed without a star. Ed convinces a church leader named Reynolds that funding Ed's script for Grave Robbers from Outer Space would result in a box office success, and generate enough money for Reynolds' dream project (the Twelve Apostles films). Dr. Tom Mason (Ned Bellamy), Kathy's chiropractor, is chosen to be B‚àö¬©la's stand-in. However, Ed and the Baptists begin having conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to Plan 9 from Outer Space along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. This causes a distressed Ed to leave the set and immediately take a taxi to the nearest bar, where he encounters his idol Orson Welles (Vincent D'Onofrio). Welles tells Ed that ""visions are worth fighting for"", and filming for Plan 9 finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. The film ends with the premiere of Plan 9, and Ed and Kathy taking off to Las Vegas, Nevada to get married.","humorous,emotional,captivating,offbeat,touching",1807.jpg,1994-09-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/ed-wood/id206329523?uo=4,CawVaHxWvnA,60010313,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Ed_Wood/60010313,"Comedy,Drama"

1702,Edward Scissorhands,"In a castle high on top of a hill lives an inventor's greatest creation - Edward, a near-complete person. The creator died before he could finish Edward's hands; instead, Edward is left with metal scissors for hands. Since then, Edward has lived alone, until a kind lady called Peg discovers Edward and welcomes him into her home. At first, everyone welcomes Edward into the community, but soon things begin to take a change for the worse.","One evening, an elderly woman tells her granddaughter a bedtime story of where snow comes from, by telling her the story of a young man named Edward (Johnny Depp), who has scissors for hands, the creation of an old Inventor (Vincent Price). The Inventor's final result was a humanlike young boy who had everything except for hands, but the Inventor had a heart attack and died while in the act of giving a pair of real hands to Edward, leaving him ""unfinished"" forever.
Many years after Edward was created, local Avon saleswoman Peg Boggs (Dianne Wiest) visits the decrepit Gothic mansion on the hill where Edward lives. There, she finds Edward alone, and upon realizing he is virtually harmless she decides to take him to her home. Edward becomes friends with Peg's young son Kevin (Robert Oliveri) and her husband Bill (Alan Arkin). He later falls in love with the Boggs' beautiful teenage daughter, Kim (Winona Ryder), despite her initial fear of him.
Peg's neighbors are impressed by Edward's adept hedge-trimming and hair-cutting skills (both of which he does with his scissor-hands), but two of the townspeople, a religious fanatic named Esmeralda (O-Lan Jones) and Kim's boyfriend, Jim (Anthony Michael Hall), immediately dislike him. One of the housewives in the neighbourhood Joyce (Kathy Baker), an ageing seductress, suggests that Edward open a hair-cutting salon with her. While examining a proposed site, she attempts to seduce him in the back room, causing Edward to leave in a state of panic.
Wanting money for a van, Jim takes advantage of Edward's ability to pick locks, and breaks into his parents' house. The burglar alarm sounds and everyone except Edward escapes, despite Kim's angry insistence that they return for him. Edward is arrested and released when a psychological examination reveals that his isolation allowed him to live without a sense of reality and common sense. Meanwhile, infuriated by Edward's rejection, Joyce exacts revenge by claiming that he tried to ""rape"" her. This, added to the ""break-in"", causes many of the neighbors to question his personality and ruin his popular reputation. During the Christmas season, Edward is feared and outcasted by almost everyone around him except the Boggs family, resulting in the family becoming outcasts as well.
While the family is setting up Christmas decorations, Edward creates an angel ice sculpture. The shavings create an effect of falling snow, which Kim dances under. Jim calls out to Kim, distracting her, and Edward accidentally cuts her hand. Jim says that Edward had intentionally harmed her and attacks him. Edward runs away, tearing the clothes Peg gave him, and wanders the neighborhood in a rage. Kim, fed up with Jim's behavior towards Edward, breaks up with him and he goes to his friend's van to get drunk. While Peg and Bill search for Edward, he returns and Kim greets him with a hug. When Kevin is almost run over by Jim's drunk friend, Edward pushes him out of the way, but cuts his face, causing witnesses to think he was attacking him. When the police arrive, Edward flees to his hilltop mansion and the vengeful neighbors follow.
Kim runs to the mansion and reunites with Edward. Jim follows them and brutally attacks Edward, who does not retaliate until Jim slaps and pushes Kim. Edward stabs Jim in the stomach and pushes him away, causing him to fall out of a window to his death. Kim confesses her love for Edward and shares a kiss with him as they say goodbye. Returning downstairs, Kim lies to the townspeople saying that Edward and Jim killed each other in the fight. She tells them that the roof caved in on them and shows them a disembodied scissor-hand similar to Edward's. Shocked and saddened over his death, the neighbors return home.
The elderly woman (now revealed to be Kim in her old age) finishes telling her granddaughter the story, saying that she never saw Edward again. She chose not to visit him because she wanted him to remember her the way she was in her youth. She also reveals that Edward is still alive, seemingly immortal since he is artificial and can never age, and he ""creates snow"" from his ice sculptures, which falls upon the neighborhood below. She tells her granddaughter that ""Sometimes you can still catch me dancing in it."" While Edward creates more ice sculptures, a flashback of a young Kim is shown dancing under the snow falling from the angel ice sculpture above her.","different,difefrent,whatif,unique,sadness,trust,odd couple,haircut,kind,human,fantasy,naive,hedge,protector,scissors,real boy,trim,usp",1702.jpg,1990-12-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/edward-scissorhands/id359722070?uo=4,,60000527,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Edward_Scissorhands/60000527,"Drama,Romance,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

While attempting to commit suicide, Drew is recieves word that his father has died and that it has fallen on Drew to make sure his dying wishes are fulfilled. On the way home to Elizabethtown, Drew meets a flight attendant (Dunst), with whom he begins a romance and in turn rediscovers the joys of life.","Drew Baylor (Bloom) is the designer of the Sp‚àö¬ßsmotica shoe, a world-famously hyped but flawed new product that his boss informs him will lose $972 million and is ""a disaster of mythic proportions, [...] a folktale told to others that makes other people feel more alive because it didn't happen to them"".
After he is fired, Drew's girlfriend Ellen (Jessica Biel) breaks up with him. Drew goes to his apartment, defeated, and attempts to commit suicide (by modifying an exercise bike and attaching a kitchen knife with duct tape so he would be stabbed to death when activating the bike). His sister Heather phones at just that moment to tell Drew that their father has just died and he needs to go to Elizabethtown, Kentucky, to bring the body back home.
At the airport, Drew's sister and mother tell him they wish to cremate his father's body. On a nearly empty plane, a quick-witted flight attendant, Claire (Dunst), gives him a free seat in First Class. He declines but she insists because she doesn't want to have to walk all the way back to Coach just for him.
Claire, who is energetic, charming, and knows how to read people, starts pestering Drew to get to know him. She knows Kentucky well and draws him a map to Elizabethtown because the roads are ""hopelessly and gloriously confusing"". She also jots her phone number on the map. When he arrives in Elizabethtown, a boy leads him to the funeral home, where Drew's cousin is waiting for him.
Various members of his family greet him as the ""California boy"", although his family had only lived in California for 18 months before moving to Oregon. After viewing his father's body, Drew meets with relatives at his Aunt Dora's house, realizing that he has a huge loving extended family in the middle-of-nowhere Kentucky.
Drew settles into a hotel that is hosting a special event called ""Chuck and Cindy: The Wedding"". The hotel is a mess from all of the people partying, and Drew is pleasantly surprised by a ""Chuck and Cindy"" gift basket in his room that states ""lovin' life"" on everything. Exhausted, Drew attempts to call home but receives no answer. He also calls his ex-girlfriend Ellen and receives no answer. Finally, he remembers that Claire gave him her number, calls her, and as she picks up, everybody else calls him back. Ellen officially breaks up with him, and his sister informs him that his mother ""won't stop moving"" as she attempts to learn how to cook, how to tap dance, and fix the car in lieu of mourning her husband's death. Claire stays on hold and when Drew returns to her line, they talk all night, connecting. Claire drives to meet Drew to see the sunrise. Claire leaves for a flight to Hawaii.
Drew meets his family near the burial plot where they would like his father's body buried. Drew insists on honoring his mother's wish for a cremation. He returns to the hotel, exhausted from being up all night on the phone with Claire and from arguing about cremation with both his mother and his extended family. Claire surprises him and takes him out all day to explore Elizabethtown, starting by helping him pick out an urn for his father. Drew is clearly attracted to Claire and she to him as well but she continues to claim that she has a boyfriend who is a professor and is ""married to his academic career.""
Later on that evening, Drew is spending time at his Aunt Dora's house and he sees a photo of his father near a flame from the stove. He suddenly regrets his choice of cremation and runs to the mortuary to stop the cremation but arrives too late and is given an urn containing his father's ashes. Drew returns to the hotel to find Claire there. They talk about their feelings and conclude they are not right for each other. They kiss and end up spending the night together. In the morning, Drew tells her about his failure and how he doesn't want to be in this world anymore. She belittles the huge failure, making him realize that he's just upset over money and failure. Disappointed in his inability to see through his pain and take this opportunity in front of him, Claire says she'll try to meet him at his father's memorial.
Drew's mother and sister arrive in Kentucky for the service. After various acquaintances speak in memory of Drew's father, his mother, Hollie, talks about her husband, comically, lightening the mood, and lifting a grudge the family has always held against her for ""taking Mitch away."" Then she does a tap-dance to his favorite song. Drew's cousin, along with his band ""Ruckus"" (consisting of members of Kentucky band My Morning Jacket), begin to play the classic Lynyrd Skynyrd song ""Free Bird"". The stage prop, a large paper dove, catches on fire, setting off alarms and causing emergency water sprinklers to go off, while everyone flees. Claire had shown up and given Drew a special map to guide him on a solitary road trip home from Kentucky. During the fire, Claire helps evacuate the room, and then she disappears.

3344,Emma,"This delightfully fun and lighthearted comedy is based on Jane Austen's classic novel. Dazzling Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Iron Man) shines as Emma- a mischievous young beauty who sets up her single friends. Funny thing is‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√áshe's not very good at it! So when Emma tries to find a man for Harriet, she makes a hilariously tangled mess of everyone's lives. You'll enjoy all the comin confusion...until Emma herself falls in love, finally freeing everyone from her outrageously misguided attempts at matchmaking.","The film describes a year in the life of Emma Woodhouse (Gwyneth Paltrow), a congenial but na‚àö√òve young woman who thinks of herself as a romantic matchmaker in her small community in early-19th-century England. When her governess, Miss Taylor (Greta Scacchi), gets married and goes to live with her new husband, Mr Weston (James Cosmo), Emma proudly takes credit for having brought the couple together. Her father and their old family friend George Knightley (Jeremy Northam) dispute her claim and disapprove of her trying to make more matches, but she ignores their warnings and sets her mind on setting up Mr Elton (Alan Cumming), the minister who performed the Westons' marriage ceremony, with Harriet Smith (Toni Collette), an unsophisticated young woman just entering society.
As a close friendship develops between Emma and Harriet, it becomes clear that Harriet is being courted by Robert Martin (Edward Woodall), a farmer who has known Harriet since she was a girl. When Mr Martin proposes to Harriet, she is inclined to accept, but she has come to rely heavily on Emma's advice, and Emma persuades her to reject the proposal. Meanwhile, Mr Elton has been expressing a desire for Emma by taking an interest in a picture she drew of Harriet and by giving her a riddle for a book of riddles being compiled by Harriet. Emma misinterprets this as interest in Harriet, but when Mr Elton and Emma are alone, he fervently declares his love for Emma herself, and she finally realizes her mistake. She rejects his pleas, and he later marries another woman, who turns out to be a vain socialite who competes with Emma for status in the community.
Over the next few months, various gatherings show who loves whom among Emma's friends. Emma is briefly attracted to a charming, gallant young man named Frank Churchill (Ewan McGregor), Mr Weston's son who comes to visit from London, but Emma soon decides to set him up with Harriet. However, Frank is revealed to have a secret engagement with a shy, pretty woman named Jane Fairfax (Polly Walker). Harriet states that she has no interest in Frank, preferring Mr Knightley, who was the only man who would dance with her at a party. Mr Knightley only danced with Harriet out of politeness and has started to fall in love with Emma.
The conclusion of the story begins when Emma ridicules a poor woman named Miss Bates (Sophie Thompson) during a picnic, after which Mr. Knightley angrily scolds Emma and leaves town for a while. She finds herself thinking about him while he's away, but does not realize she loves him until Harriet expresses interest in him. When Mr Knightley returns, he and Emma cross paths in a meadow and have a conversation that begins awkwardly but ends with him asking her to marry him and her gladly accepting. The news of their engagement upsets Harriet, who avoids Emma for a while, but returns a few weeks later, engaged to Mr Martin. The film ends with Emma and Mr Knightley's wedding.","witty,feel good,humorous,clever,captivating,touching",3344.jpg,1996-08-02, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/emma/id514463001?uo=4,,474481,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Emma/474481,"Comedy,Romance"

210,Empire of the Sun,"Based on J. G. Ballard's autobiographical novel, tells the story of a boy, James Graham, An aristocratic British youth is seperated from his family at the start of World War II after the Japanese Army invades British controlled areas of China. His privileged life is upturned by the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, December 8, 1941. Separated from his parents and reduced to living on the street and fighting for food, he is eventually captured, and taken to Soo Chow confinement camp, next to a captured Chinese airfield. Here, admiration quickly develops both for captured American pilots and the Japanese themselves. When the war ends, the boy torn from everything he knew attempts to again find his parents. Amidst the sickness and food shortages in the camp, Jim attempts to reconstruct his former life, all the while bringing spirit and dignity to those around him.  
","Japan had been at war with China since 1937 before declaring war on the United States and the United Kingdom. During the conflict, Jamie Graham, a British upper middle class schoolboy living in the Shanghai International Settlement, is separated from his parents. He spends some time living in his deserted house and eating remnants of food but eventually he ventures out into the city and finds it bustling with Japanese troops. Jamie is captured along with Basie, an American sailor, who nicknames him ""Jim"". They are taken to Lunghua Civilian Assembly Center in Shanghai, but are later moved to Soochow Creek Internment Camp. By 1945, a few months before the end of the Pacific War, Jim has established a good living, despite the poor conditions of the camp. He has an extensive trading network, even involving the camp's commanding officer, Sergeant Nagata.
Dr. Rawlins, the camp's British doctor, becomes a father figure to Jim. Through the barbwire fencing, Jim befriends a Japanese teenager, who shares Jim's dream of becoming a pilot. Still idolizing Basie, Jim frequently visits him in the American soldiers' barracks. At one point, Basie charges him to set snare traps outside the wire of the camp and while Jim succeeds, thanks to the help of the Japanese teenager from the other side, the real reason for sending Jim into the marsh was actually to test the area for land mines. As a reward, Basie allows Jim to move into the American barracks with him. Basie then plots to escape.
Nagata visits Basie's barracks and beats him severely after discovering a stolen bar of Japanese soap hidden under a table. While Basie is in the infirmary, his possessions are stolen by other men in the camp. One morning at dawn, Jim witnesses a kamikaze ritual of three Japanese pilots at the air base. Overcome with emotion at the solemnity of the ceremony, he begins to sing the Welsh song Suo G‚àö¬¢n. A few minutes later the camp comes under attack by a group of American P-51 Mustang fighter aircraft. As a result of the attack the Japanese decide to evacuate the camp. During the confusion of the attack, Basie escapes, leaving Jim behind, although he had promised to take Jim with him. The camp's prisoners march through the wilderness where many die of fatigue, starvation and disease. During the march Jim witnesses a flash from the atomic bombing of Nagasaki hundreds of miles away, and later hears news of Japan's surrender and the end of the war.
Jim sneaks away from the group and goes back to Soochow Creek, nearly dead from starvation. He encounters the Japanese teenager he knew earlier, who has since become a pilot and appears distraught at the surrender of his country. The youth remembers Jim and offers him a mango, cutting it for him with his katana. As Jim is about to eat it, Basie reappears with a group of armed Americans, who have arrived to loot the Red Cross containers that were dropped after the Japanese surrender. One of the Americans, thinking Jim is in danger, shoots and kills the Japanese youth. Jim, furious, beats the American who shot his friend. Basie drags him off and promises to take him back to Shanghai to find his parents, but Jim refuses the offer and stays behind. He is found by American soldiers and put in an orphanage in Shanghai with other children who had lost their parents. When his parents come looking for him, Jim is so scarred from his experiences that he does not recognize them at first.","pow,sadness,emotional,touching,prisoner of war,friendship,coming of age,boy,atmospheric,captivating,hope,gloomy",210.jpg,1987-12-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/empire-of-the-sun/id286533857?uo=4,BT2bMVneriA,60010320,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Empire_of_the_Sun/60010320,Drama

3193,Enduring Love,"On a beautiful cloudless day a young couple celebrate their reunion with a picnic. Joe has planned a postcard-perfect afternoon in the English countryside with his partner, Claire. But as Joe and Claire prepare to open a bottle of champagne, their idyll comes to an abrupt end. A hot air balloon drifts into the field, obviously in trouble. The pilot catches his leg in the anchor rope, while the only passenger, a boy, is too scared to jump down. Joe and three other men rush to secure the basket. Just as they secure the balloon, the wind rushes into the field, and at once the rescuers are airborne.

Going to retrieve the body of the fallen man with fellow rescuer Jed Parry, for example, turns out to be a very bad move. Jed feels an instant connection with Joe‚Äö√Ñ√Æone that, as the weeks go by, becomes ever more intense.[1]
Days after the incident, Joe spends a lot of time trying to map out ways that could have saved the man who fell to his death. One day, while drawing diagrams of how the day could have ended differently, he receives an odd phone call from Jed, telling him to come outside so that they can talk about what happened on the field. Joe looks out of the window and sees Jed standing across the road from his house staring up at Joe's window. Joe is reluctant but Jed promises that he will leave Joe alone if he just comes outside and talks to him about what happened that day. After Jed makes some comments that make Joe uneasy, he decides to leave, telling Jed to leave him alone. Not too long after this, Joe visits a local bookshop and out of nowhere Jed makes an appearance, appearing to have followed Joe to the bookshop. Joe is angered by this and tells Jed that he doesn't want to see him at all. Jed is hurt by this and continues to tell Joe to 'be brave' and admit what passed between them at the field. Then Jed leaves Joe and says 'don't let me down, not like you let him down.' (meaning the man who fell from the balloon). The next time we see Joe is when he is lecturing at a the college he works at in what seems to be psychology. At lunch, he sits down with a work colleague and then spots Jed sitting at the table next to him. He shouts at Jed, causing a scene when Jed tells him to 'be brave' again. Joe tells Jed that all he wants is for Jed to leave him alone, which after hearing this, Jed leaves the restaurant. Joe then visits the wife of the man that had died and she tells him that she believes that he was having an affair after the police returned a picnic for two that was found in his car to her address along with a woman's scarf that does not belong to her. After hearing this he decides to figure out who was with the man on the day he died.
On Joe's birthday, Claire makes him a special birthday dinner. At dinner, it is clear to see the strain on their relationship as there is a lot of silence and neither seems willing to make much conversations. After Claire sees that Joe is lost in thought and not paying her any attention she loses her temper and clears the table. It is obvious that she is fed up with Joe's behaviour and lack of communication. The next day, Joe goes swimming and when having finished he looks up to see Jed, standing by the window of the pool. Joe asks Jed to meet him in the caf‚àö¬©. They talk and Joe demands to know why Jed won't leave him alone. Jed, once again, makes Joe uneasy and Joe leaves. In the next scene, Joe and Claire are joined by Robin and Rachel, Claire's brother and his new girlfriend. Joe then tells Claire that he had planned to propose to her on the day of the accident but since then has changed his mind. This drives another wedge between them and the evening is ruined.
The next day at Joe's lecture, Jed tuns up in the class and sings to Joe they then go outside and Jed talks about how Joe is sending him signals, using a curtain reference. Joe is confused, tells Jed to leave and then later that night researches the significance between stalkers and 'curtain signals'. He finally concludes that Jed standing beneath his window every night watches him draw the curtains, thinking that the way they are drawn is a secret message (such as 'come and see me', 'I love you' or 'talk to me') after explaining this to Claire, he looks out of the window and sees Jed sitting in the park across from his house watching him. Joe asks Claire to come to the window and look at Jed but she just goes back to sleep, obviously not believing him. The next morning Claire comes down the stairs and tells Joe that it's over between them. Joe, angry, pays a visit to Jed and they argue. Joe leaves and goes to a bar where he drinks a lot of alcohol and then goes to Robin and Rachel's house where he stays the night. When he wakes up, his friend tells him that Claire just called and that Claire had told him to come over as Jed was in their house. Joe races to his house and enters the living room to find Jed and Claire sitting next to each other on the sofa. Jed looks as if he has been beaten up and falsely blames Joe although in an earlier scene we see Joe leave Jed's house with Jed unharmed so the only answer would be that Jed has done this to himself. Joe loses his temper and then out of the blue, Jed stabs Claire with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor, bleeding. Joe then pretends to accept Jed into his life and they kiss. As they kiss, Joe grabs hold of the knife from Jed and stabs him. Jed falls, bleeding to the floor, while Joe rushes to Claire's aid and phone an ambulance.
The next time we see Joe is when he is back on the field where it all started and he is joined by a couple and the wife of the man who die on that very spot. Joe explains that the woman's husband had not cheated on her but was giving the couple a lift in his car. After this Joe sits down on the grass and it shortly joined by Claire, they are still separated but during their conversation, the audience believe that they will give things another go. Just before the ending credits, Jed is shown in a mental institution and appears to be writing a letter, he look up at the camera and smiles.","bleak,disturbing,contemplative,gloomy,tense",3193.jpg,2004-09-04, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/enduring-love/id268253193?uo=4,,70012790,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Enduring_Love/70012790,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

1815,Erin Brockovich,"A real woman. A real story. A real triumph. In her Oscar-winning role, Julia Roberts stars as Erin Brockovich, a feisty young mother who fought for justice any way she knew how. Desperate for a job to support herself and her three children, she convinces attorney Ed Masry (Albert Finney) to hire her and promptly stumbles upon a monumental case against a giant corporation. Now Erin's determined to take on this powerful adversary even though no law firm has dared to do it before. And while Ed doesn't want anything to do with the case, Erin won't take ""no"" for an answer. So the two begin an incredible and sometimes hilarious fight that will bring a small town to its feet and a huge company to its knees.","In 1993, Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts) is an unemployed single mother of three children, who has recently been injured in a traffic accident with a doctor and is suing him. Her lawyer, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), expects to win, but Erin's attitude in the courtroom makes her lose the case. She tells Ed he should find her a job in compensation. Ed gives and subsequently hires her as a file clerk in his office.
While working, Erin sees the files in a pro bono real-estate case in which Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) is offering to purchase the home of Hinkley, California, resident Donna Jensen. Erin is surprised to see medical records in the file and visits Donna, who explains that she had simply kept all her PG&E correspondence together. Donna is very appreciative of PG&E's help: she has had several tumors and her husband has Hodgkin's disease, but PG&E has always supplied a doctor at their own expense. Erin asks why they would do that, and Donna replies, ""because of the chromium"". Erin begins digging into the particulars of the case and soon finds evidence that the groundwater in Hinkley is contaminated with dangerous hexavalent chromium, but PG&E is telling Hinkley residents that they use a safer form of chromium in their cooling ponds. She persuades Ed to allow her further research, and wins the trust of many Hinkley residents. She finds many other cases of tumors and other medical problems in Hinkley. Everyone has been treated by PG&E's doctors and thinks the cluster of cases is just a coincidence, unrelated to the ""safe"" chromium.
Eventually, a man approaches her and says that he was tasked with destroying documents at PG&E, but he had noticed the medical conditions plaguing the workers who worked in the unlined ponds, and kept the documents instead. He then delivers the documents to her. One is a 1966 memo that ties a conversation with a corporate executive in the San Francisco PG&E headquarters to the Hinkley station: it proves that the corporate headquarters knew the water was contaminated with hexavalent chromium, did nothing about it, and advised the Hinkley station to keep it a secret from the neighborhood.
Rather than delay any settlement for years through a series of jury trials and probable appeals, Ed takes the opportunity to arrange for a final disposition by binding arbitration. Erin is able to persuade the 634 plaintiffs to go along, and the evidence is examined by a judge without a jury. The judge orders PG&E to pay a settlement amount of $333 million, divided among the plaintiffs. In the final scene, Ed hands Erin her agreed bonus payment for the case, but says he has changed the amount. She starts to complain that she deserves more respect, but is astonished to see that he has increased it to $2 million.","legal,water,whatif,sincere,uplifting,trust,witty,thought provoking,captivating,disturbing,woman,touching,trick,hypothesis,surprise,contamination,fear",1815.jpg,2000-03-14, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/erin-brockovich/id280700731?uo=4,keZXGaDvK2s,60000165,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Erin_Brockovich/60000165,"Comedy,Drama"
906,Escape from Alcatraz,"Superstar Clint Eastwood and director Don Siegal re-team for their fifth film in this fascinating account of the only three men ever to escape from the infamous maximum security prison at Alcatraz. In 29 years, the seemingly impenetrable federal penitentiary, which housed Al Capone and ""Birdman"" Robert Stroud, was only broken once - by three men never heard of again. Eastwood portrays Frank Morris, the cunning bank robber who masterminded the elaborately detailed and, as far as anyone knows, ultimately successful, escape. Patrick McGoohan is a superb counterpoint as the suspicious warden. Filmed on location in Alcatraz, this gritty and realistic reenactment of a true story has all the power one expects of an Eastwood/Siegel movie.","The story begins as Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) arrives at the maximum security prison Alcatraz, having been sent there after escaping from several other prisons. He is sent in to meet the warden (Patrick McGoohan), who curtly informs him that no one has ever escaped from Alcatraz. Eventually he meets his old friends, brothers John and Clarence Anglin (Fred Ward and Jack Thibeau), and he makes the acquaintance of the prisoner in the cell next to his, Charlie Butts (Larry Hankin). Morris befriends numerous other inmates, including English (Paul Benjamin), a black inmate serving two life sentences for killing two white men in self-defense; the eccentric Litmus (who keeps a pet mouse and calls himself Al Capone), and the elderly artist and chrysanthemum grower Doc (Roberts Blossom).
Morris also makes an enemy of the rapist Wolf (Bruce M. Fischer), whom Morris beats in the shower room after Wolf attempts to come onto him. Still seething from this encounter, Wolf attacks Morris in the yard and both men spend time in the hole. When the warden discovers that Doc has painted a portrait of him, as well as other policemen on the island itself, he permanently removes Doc's painting privileges; in response, a depressed Doc cuts his fingers off with a hatchet from the prison workshop and is led away. Later, the warden finds one of Doc's chrysanthemums and crushes it in front of the inmates; an angry Litmus leaps at the warden and suffers a fatal heart attack. The warden coldly reminds Morris that ""some men are destined never to leave Alcatraz--alive.""
Morris notices that the concrete around the grille in his cell is weak and can be chipped way, which evolves into an escape plan. Over the next few months Morris, Butts and the Anglins dig through the walls of their cells with spoons (which have been soldered into makeshift shovels), make papier-m‚àö¬¢ch‚àö¬© dummies to act as decoys, and construct a raft out of raincoats.

2808,Eve's Bayou,"Louis Batiste (Samuel L. Jackson) is a popular physician in 1960s Louisiana who has a beautiful wife (Lynn Whitfield), a loving family and a weakness for women. While his wife ignores his infidelities, his youngest daughter Eve is crushed when she catches her dad in a compromising situation. Her subsequent revelations tear the family apart in Kasi Lemmons' powerful film, which won Best First Feature at the Independent Spirit Awards.","Eve Batiste (Jurnee Smollett), a ten year old girl, lives in a prosperous African American community in Louisiana with her younger brother Poe, and her sister Cisely (Meagan Good) a pretty girl who is just entering puberty. Their parents are Roz (Lynn Whitfield) and Louis (Samuel L. Jackson), a well respected doctor in Louisiana's ""colored"" community. One night after a raucous party, Eve accidentally witnesses her father having sex with family friend Matty Mereaux (Lisa Nicole Carson). However, Cisely, who has a very affectionate relationship with her father, convinces Eve that she misinterpreted an innocent moment. The unreliability of memory and observation remain important themes throughout the film.
The summer quickly becomes a chaotic and stressful one for the Batiste family. Eve's relationship with her parents becomes more strained as she discovers more evidence of her father's serial infidelity. Cisely comes into conflict with both her sister and her mother as she enters puberty and tries to navigate the difficult transition to adulthood, particularly with regards to her appearance and sexuality. Roz eventually begins to suspect her husband's infidelity, prompting conflict between the two as well.
During the chaotic summer, Eve often seeks refuge with her aunt Mozelle Batiste (Debbi Morgan), who works as a fortune teller and who has had a string of lovers who all died violently. After Eve has a confusing vision of something terrible happening, Mozelle informs her that the gift of second sight runs in their family. Meanwhile, Eve, angered by her father's infidelity, begins to tease Matty Mereaux's husband Lenny (Roger Guenveur Smith) with her knowledge about it.
One day Cisely confides in Eve the secret of why she's been so moody. One night, after their parents had a vicious argument, Cisely went to comfort her father and he, drunk, tried to rape her. Enraged, Eve seeks out a local witch, Elzora (Diahann Carroll), and commissions a voodoo spell to put a fatal curse on her father. The Baptiste's family life totally disintegrates as Cisely's accusations against her father become known. Concerned that her father might be innocent, Eve tries to undo the curse on him but discovers that this is impossible. She then rushes to bring her father home, finding him in a bar chatting with Matty Mereaux. At the same time, a drunken Lenny arrives to take Matty home and shoots and kills Louis after a confrontation. After her father's funeral, Eve soon finds a letter which her father wrote to Mozelle. In it he explains that Cisely had come to him that night and kissed him, first as a daughter and then as a lover. In his drunken state he reacted violently, slapping her and pushing her to the ground, which made her angry. The letter implies that Cisely made up her story. Eve confronts Cisely and uses her second sight to try and discover what really happened, but the two stories are so jumbled within Cisely's own mind that the truth is obscured.",,2808.jpg,1997-11-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/eves-bayou/id322904870?uo=4,TbtdDKf3zAU,1179987,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Eve_s_Bayou/1179987,Drama
2932,Event Horizon,"In the year 2047 a group of astronauts are sent to investigate and salvage the long lost starship ""Event Horizon"". The ship disappeared mysteriously 7 years before on its maiden voyage and with its return comes even more mystery as the crew of the ""Lewis and Clark"" discover the real truth behind its disappearance and something even more terrifying. 

The high-tech, pioneering research spacecraft mysteriously vanished, without a trace, on its maiden voyage seven years earlier. But a weak, persistent signal form the long-missing craft prompts a rescue team, headed by the intrepid Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) to wing its way through the galaxy on a bold rescue mission. Accompanying Miller is his elite crew and the lost ship‚Äö√Ñ√¥s designer (Sam Neill) their mission is to find and salvage the state-of-the-art interstellar horror. 
","In 2047, the rescue vessel Lewis and Clark is dispatched to answer a distress signal received from the Event Horizon, a starship that disappeared during its maiden voyage to Proxima Centauri seven years prior. Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne) and his crew ‚Äö√Ñ√ÆLieutenant Starck (Joely Richardson), pilot Smith (Sean Pertwee), Medical Technician Peters (Kathleen Quinlan), Engineer Ensign Justin (Jack Noseworthy), Rescue Technician Cooper (Richard T. Jones), and Trauma Doctor D.J. (Jason Isaacs) ‚Äö√Ñ√Æare joined for the mission by the Event Horizon's designer Dr. William Weir (Sam Neill). Dr. Weir briefs the crew that the Event Horizon was built to test an experimental gravity drive which generates an artificial black hole to use the immense gravitational power to bridge two points in spacetime, greatly reducing travel time over astronomical distances.
Upon arriving at the ship's decaying orbit around Neptune and boarding the Event Horizon to search for survivors, the crew finds evidence of a massacre. During the search, the ship's gravity drive activates automatically. Justin is pulled into the resulting portal, returning in a catatonic state. He is later placed in stasis after a failed suicide attempt in apprehension over the events he witnessed during his crossover. The activation of the gravity drive causes a massive shockwave which critically damages the Lewis and Clark and forces the entire crew to board the Event Horizon. The crew then begins experiencing hallucinations of their fears and regrets: Miller sees a subordinate, Corrick, he was forced to abandon in a fire; Peters sees images of her son Denny with his legs covered in bloody lesions; and Dr. Weir, a widower, sees his wife Claire with missing eyes, urging him to join her.
After deciphering a warning from a video log of the Event Horizon's crew going insane and mutilating each other, Miller and D.J. deduce that while the ship's gravity drive did successfully open a gateway in spacetime, it leapt outside the known universe and into another dimension, described later on by Dr. Weir as ""a dimension of pure chaos, pure evil"" (and implied to be Hell). The Event Horizon has since then gained an evil sentience and telekinetic abilities, tormenting its occupants with the aim of compelling them to return to Hell.
Miller decides to destroy the Event Horizon despite objections from Dr. Weir, who is seduced and eventually possessed by the evil presence and uses an explosive device from the Event Horizon to destroy the Lewis and Clark. Smith is killed in the explosion which also launches Cooper out of the ship and into space. Peters dies from a long fall after being lured into the engineering section by an apparition of her son. Dr. Weir kills D.J. by vivisecting him and corners Starck on the bridge. Miller tries to rescue Starck but is caught by Dr. Weir, who activates the ship's gravity drive, initiating a ten minute countdown after which the Event Horizon and its passengers will return to the other dimension. Cooper, having used his space suit's oxygen to propel him back to the ship, tries to contact those inside, and Dr. Weir retaliates by shooting out the bridge window. Dr. Weir is blown out into space by the ensuing decompression while Miller, Starck, and Cooper survive and manage to seal off the bridge area of the ship.
Miller then resolves to detonate the explosives installed on the Event Horizon to split the ship in two and use the forward section of the ship as a lifeboat. He is attacked by manifestations of Corrick and Dr. Weir, who shows Miller horrifying visions of the Lewis and Clark's crew being tortured and mutilated once they return to Hell. Miller fights off the manifestation and manages to detonate the explosives, sacrificing himself so Justin, Cooper, and Starck can escape. The gravity drive activates, pulling the rear of the ship into a wormhole. Starck and Cooper join Justin in stasis and wait to be rescued.
72 days later, the Event Horizon is located by a rescue party, who discover the remaining crew still in stasis. Starck has a nightmare of the scarred Dr. Weir being one of the rescuers and is awakened in a distraught state by a rescue team. Cooper restrains Starck and one of the rescuers calls for a sedative as the doors omniously close as the camera pans back.","fantasy,exciting,scary,bleak,suspenseful,rough,atmospheric,fear",2932.jpg,1997-08-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/event-horizon/id306163996?uo=4,gd0nQUF00Sg,1179574,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Event_Horizon/1179574,"Horror,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

976,Eyes Wide Shut,"A doctor becomes obsessed with having a sexual encounter after his wife admits to having sexual fantasies about a man she met and chastising him for dishonesty in not admitting to his own fantasies. This sets him off into unfulfilled encounters with a dead patient's daughter and a hooker. But when he visits a nightclub, where a pianist friend Nick Nightingale is playing, he learns about a secret sexual group and decides to attend one of their congregations. However, he quickly learns he is in well over his head and finds he and his family are threatened. ","Dr. Bill Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice (Nicole Kidman), a young couple from New York, go to a Christmas party, given by a wealthy patient, Victor Ziegler (Sydney Pollack). Bill meets an old friend from med school, Nick Nightingale (Todd Field), who now plays piano professionally. While a Hungarian man (Sky du Mont) tries to pick up Alice, two young models try to take Bill off for a tryst. He is interrupted by a call from his host upstairs, who had been having sex with Mandy (Julienne Davis), a young woman who has overdosed on a speedball.
Next evening at home, while smoking marijuana, Bill's wife asks him if he had sex with the two girls. After Bill reassures her, she asks if he is ever jealous of men who are attracted to her. As the discussion gets heated, he states that he thinks women are more faithful than men. She rebuts him, telling him of a recent fantasy she had about a naval officer they had encountered on a vacation.
Disturbed by Alice's revelation, Bill is just then called to the deathbed of the father of a now-engaged female friend (Marie Richardson), who impulsively kisses him and tells him she loves him. Putting her off, Bill takes a walk and meets a prostitute named Domino (Vinessa Shaw), and goes to her apartment. His wife phones as he begins to kiss her, after which he calls off the awkward encounter.
Meeting Nick at a cafe, Bill learns that Nick has a following engagement where he must play piano blindfolded, in which Nick claims to have glimpsed beautiful women. After Bill presses for details, he learns that to gain admittance, one needs a costume, a mask and the password. Bill drives late at night to a costume shop. He offers the owner, Mr. Milich (Rade Serbedzija), a generous amount of money to rent a costume, and while searching, Milich catches his teenage daughter (Leelee Sobieski) with two Japanese men and expresses outrage at their lack of sense of decency, and threatens to call the police.
Bill then takes a taxi out to a country mansion where a quasi-religious sexual ritual is taking place. One woman takes Bill aside and warns him he does not belong there, insisting he is in terrible danger for they suspect that he is an outsider. Bill is then interrupted by a masked porter who tells him that the taxi driver who is waiting outside wants to speak with him. However, the porter takes him to the main room where the masked, red-cloaked Master of Ceremonies confronts Bill with a question about a second password which Bill is unable to answer. The Master of Ceremonies insists that Bill ""kindly remove his mask"", then asks that he remove his clothes. The masked young woman who had tried to warn Bill now intervenes and insists that she be punished instead of him. Bill is ushered from the mansion and warned not to tell anyone about what happened there.
Just before dawn, Bill arrives home guilty and confused, where his wife Alice is now awake and tells him of a troubling dream in which she had sex with the naval officer and many other men, while laughing at the idea of Bill seeing her with them.
Next morning Bill goes to Nick's hotel, and the desk clerk (Alan Cumming) tells Bill that a bruised and frightened Nick checked out a few hours earlier after returning with two large, dangerous-looking men. Nick tried to pass an envelope to him when they were leaving, but it was intercepted, then Nick was driven away by the two men.
Bill goes to return the costume ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ but not the mask, which Bill has misplaced ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ and Milich, with his daughter by his side, states he can do other favors for Bill ""and it needn't be a costume"". The Japanese men leave; Milich implies to Bill that he has sold his daughter for prostitution. Bill returns to the mansion in his own car and is greeted at the gate by a man with a note warning him to cease and desist his inquiries. At home, Bill thinks about Alice's dream while he watches her tutor their daughter.
That evening, Bill goes to the home of the prostitute with a gift. Her roommate greets him, telling him Domino has just discovered she has HIV. Bill leaves and notices a well-dressed man is following him. After losing him, Bill reads a newspaper story about a beauty queen who had died of a drug overdose, whom Bill recognizes as Mandy. After Bill examines Mandy's body at the morgue, Ziegler summons Bill to his house and tells him he knows all the events of the past night and day. Ziegler was one of those involved with the ritual orgy and his own position with the secret society has been jeopardized by Bill's intrusion. Bill asks about the death of Mandy, whom Ziegler has identified as the woman at the party who'd ""sacrificed"" herself to prevent Bill's punishment, and about Nick. Ziegler insists that Nick is safely back at home in Seattle, but does not know where to contact him. Ziegler also insists that the ""punishment"" had nothing to do with Mandy's death; she was a junkie and she has died from another accidental drug overdose. Bill does not know if Ziegler is telling him the truth, but says nothing further.
When Bill returns home, he sees the rented mask on his pillow next to his sleeping wife. He breaks down in tears and as Alice awakes, he decides to tell her the whole truth of the past two days. The next morning they go Christmas shopping. His wife muses that recent events do not define their life and they should be grateful they have survived and are still together and that she loves him. She then says they need to, in her own words, ""fuck"" as soon as possible.","sexy,contemplative,tense,sexual,atmospheric,anticipation,captivating,gloomy,fear",976.jpg,1999-07-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/eyes-wide-shut/id272819260?uo=4,VXEziyz9duA,5670434,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Eyes_Wide_Shut/5670434,"Drama,Romance"

Turning the cameras provides a fresh and impactful perspective on Ali, the sport, talent and courage.","Facing Ali is a 2009 documentary directed by Pete McCormack about Muhammad Ali (born Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr. in Louisville, Kentucky) as told from the perspectives of some of the notable opponents he faced during his career: George Chuvalo, Sir Henry Cooper, George Foreman,""Smokin'"" Joe Frazier, Larry Holmes (a former sparring partner of Ali), Ron Lyle, Ken Norton, Earnie Shavers, Leon Spinks and Ernie Terrell.

2962,Fallen,"Det. John Hobbes is convinced that when killer Edgar Reese is executed, all of his troubles are over. But when people he knows and people on the street start to sing the same tune that Reese sang in the gas chamber, and those same people taunt him, he is told that maybe the cursed fallen angel Azazel is behind it all. Azazel is cursed to roam the Earth without a form, and he can switch bodies by any contact, making him hard to track. When Hobbes is forced to kill a man possessed by Azazel, he must clear his name while protecting his family and others from the evil, vengeful Azazel.","The film opens with Philadelphia Police Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) in a snowy wood. In the present day, Hobbes gains notoriety for capturing serial killer Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas). After Reese is executed, Hobbes and his partner Jonesy (John Goodman) investigate a string of murders by an apparent copycat killer. Eventually Hobbes tracks down the killer and confronts him alone, where the man makes a startling claim: he is the same killer Hobbes sentenced to death, but not Edgar Reese; rather, he is the demon Azazel, and was possessing Reese's body during the murders. Azazel claims he can possess any person merely by touching them. One of the few exceptions is Detective Hobbes, which has turned Azazel's ire at the Detective for capturing him into an obsession. Hobbes is skeptical of Azazel's claims until the demon begins to sing ""Time Is on My Side"", then begins to possess people via touch, continuing to sing the song as he moves from body to body before fading away into the crowd of people on the street. Hobbes follows a lead from a riddle Azazel gave him concerning Robert Milano, a decorated cop who committed suicide in his mountain cabin 30 years earlier. Hobbes locates Milano's daughter, Gretta (Embeth Davidtz), who explains that her father was framed for corruption and killed himself to avoid his eventual conviction. When Hobbes journeys to the cabin, he finds a clue uncovering a deeper truth: when he died Milano was trying to kill Azazel.
To provoke Hobbes, Azazel possesses his nephew Sam (Michael J. Pagan) and attacks John's intellectually disabled brother Art (Gabriel Casseus) in their home. He flees into other people on the street, ending up in a schoolteacher. As the teacher, Azazel draws a gun and forces Hobbes to shoot his host in front of a group of bystanders. Hobbes comes to realize that Azazel can transfer from body to body upon his host's death and inhabit anyone‚Äö√Ñ√Æincluding Hobbes. Lieutenant Stanton (Donald Sutherland) informs Hobbes that his fingerprints were found at one of the murder scenes and along with the bizarre circumstances of the shooting of the teacher Azazel possessed, he has become a suspect for all the murders. Azazel inhabits several of the witnesses and gives false accounts that the shooting was unprovoked, thereby throwing further suspicion on Hobbes.
Azazel sneaks into Hobbes' home overnight by possessing his brother Art to make him commit suicide by injecting himself with poison. The next day, Hobbes takes Sam to Gretta's where they consult several ancient texts and discover that Azazel's ability to transfer from body to body in spirit form has a finite range of about one-sixth of a mile and must be performed within a relatively short time period. Hobbes then leaves Sam with Gretta and drives alone to Milano's remote cabin to isolate and trap Azazel. A short while later, Lieutenant Stanton and Jonesy arrive to take Hobbes into custody. Jonesy suddenly shoots Stanton, revealing himself to be possessed by Azazel, and then chases Hobbes into the cabin. They fight for control of the gun, during which Jonesy is mortally wounded.
As Jonesy slowly expires, Hobbes smokes a poison-laced cigarette and taunts Azazel with the fact that he will soon be dead and his body will be useless as a host, thus trapping and killing him. Hobbes kills Jonesy by shooting him in the head, but Azazel then possesses Hobbes. He frantically tries to find a new host but succumbs to the poison in Hobbes' system. Azazel survives, however, by possessing a cat nearby. Throughout the film, the overdubbed narration of Hobbes' voice sometimes interjects, often explaining certain situations, almost in a noir-like style. In the very last scene, when the cat comes out of the cabin, the narrator is revealed to be Azazel himself who claims that the war against souls is far from over.","scary,angel,suspenseful,fall,believe,devil,atmospheric,fear",2962.jpg,1998-01-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/fallen/id279598772?uo=4,Mth5u2PPFbY,1192866,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Fallen/1192866,"Animation,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
1002,Family Affair,"At 10 years old, Chico Colvard accidentally shot his older sister in the leg. This seemingly random act detonated a chain reaction that exposed unspeakable realities and shattered his family. Thirty years later, Colvard ruptures veils of secrecy and silence again. As he bravely visits his relatives, what unfolds is a personal film that's as uncompromising, raw, and cathartic as any in the history of the medium. Driving the story forward is Colvard's sensitive probing of a complex dynamic: the way his three sisters survived severe childhood abuse by their father and, as adults, manage to muster loyalty to him. These unforgettable, invincible women paint a picture of their harrowing girlhoods as they resiliently struggle with present-day fallout. The distance time gives them from their trauma yields piercing insights about the legacy of abuse, the nature of forgiveness, and eternal longing for family and love. These truths may be too searing to bear, but they reverberate powerfully within each of us.","FAMILY AFFAIR had its world premiere at the Sundance 2010 Film Festival and became the talk of the festival.

Using a verite approach, this film paints a truer reality of the father-daughter relationship, which our imaginations are often unable to consider, while exploring how pedophilia can manipulate and control an entire family for life.-- (C) C-Line Films",,1002.jpg,2010-01,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/family-affair/id522186149?uo=4 ,,,,"Documentary,Kids & Family,Special Interest"

He thus brings aboard Susan Storm, his shy, though assertive chief genetics researcher and a former lover of Reed's with whom she had an acrimonious break-up, and her diametrically opposed brother Johnny, the maverick and hot-headed playboy pilot. The astronauts make it home intact; however, before long they begin to mutate, developing strange and amazing powers as a result of their exposure to the cloud! Reed is able to stretch like rubber; Sue can turn invisible and create force fields, especially when angered; Johnny can produce fire at supernova temperatures, and is able to fly; and Ben is transformed into ""The Thing"", a large, rock-like creature with super strength. After Ben, brooding about his situation on the Brooklyn Bridge, inadvertently causes a major traffic pile-up whilst attempting to stop a man about to commit suicide, the four manage to use their powers to prevent any loss of life and to rescue a fire truck and its crew from falling off the bridge in a resulting explosion. The media dubs the team the 'Fantastic Four', and whilst Johnny eagerly embraces his powers and new life, Ben - the most heavily disfigured - particularly suffers from his transformation; his disfigurement has caused his fianc‚àö¬©e to abandon him and has seen him shunned and feared by much of New York. Blaming himself, Reed vows to return Ben to his human form, and he, Sue and Ben work on a cure, constructing a healing chamber in Reed's high tech Baxter Building loft-turned-laboratory. During this time, Reed and Susan begin to grow close once again, and Susan admits that she is not interested in Victor, but ended their relationship because Reed feared to commit, thinking only in terms of variables. Unknown to the others, however, Victor's body is also mutating; he is turning into organic metal capable of absorbing and manipulating electrical energy known as Doctor Doom. As a result of the disastrous expedition, his company is going bankrupt and he is losing public stature; blaming Reed for his misfortunes, Victor swears revenge. And Reed, Ben, Susan, and Johnny must defeat Victor Von Doom and foil his evil plans once and for all.

2405,Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer,"The Fantastic Four meet their greatest challenge yet in Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer, as the enigmatic, intergalactic herald, The Silver Surfer, comes to Earth to prepare it for destruction. As he races around the globe wreaking havoc, Reed (Ioan Gruffudd), Sue (Jessica Alba), Johnny (Chris Evans) and Ben (Michael Chiklis) must unravel the mystery before all hope is lost. With Von Doom back in his homeland of Latveria the fantastic four have new troubles when Galactus has decided that Earth is his next target. When his henchman, The Silver Surfer, is sent to Earth he discovers that he's getting more than he bargained for when he encounters the Fantastic Four. But that's not all when Dr. Doom decides that after two years in the homeland he is ready to return.","As Reed Richards (Ioan Gruffudd) and Sue Storm (Jessica Alba) prepare for their wedding, a silver object enters Earth's atmosphere, radiating cosmic energy that creates massive molecular fluctuations and causes deep craters at locations across the Earth. The US government approaches Richards to track and identify the movements of the object. He initially refuses, to appease Sue who feels he is again starting to neglect her for his science projects (made worse after she catches him dancing at his bachelor party with three other ladies), however, he surreptitiously builds a radar tracker which will locate the object, as the Army requests.
During the wedding, Reed's systems detect the phenomenon approaching the city, and as a result the city suffers a blackout, creating chaos and damage, which the Fantastic Four try to minimize. Johnny Storm (Chris Evans) pursues the object, discovering it to be a silvery humanoid riding a flying surfboard. The ""Silver Surfer"" (Doug Jones) drags him into the upper atmosphere then drops him back toward Earth. During his fall Johnny finds his abilities fluctuating, and barely manages to survive the fall, successfully flying at the last minute. Later, Sue and Johnny switch powers when they touch, prompting Reed to examine Johnny revealing that exposure to the Surfer has set Johnny's molecular structure in flux, allowing him to switch powers with his teammates through physical contact. Tracing the cosmic energy of the Surfer, Reed discovers that a series of planets the alien had visited have all been destroyed.
The Surfer has been creating deep artificial craters around the globe. Reed determines that the next crater will appear in London, and the team travel there. They arrive too late to stop the crater, and the River Thames drains into it. Afterwards, both Reed and Sue contemplate abandoning their lives as superheroes in order to provide a normal life to raise a family. The Surfer's movements around the globe bring him past Latveria, where the cosmic energy affects Victor von Doom (Julian McMahon), freeing him from two years as a metal statue. Doom, able to move again but scarred, traces the Surfer to the Russell Glacier and makes him an offer to join forces. When the Surfer rebuffs him, Doom attacks. The Surfer returns fire, blasting Doom through the ice. The cosmic energy of the Surfer's blast heals Doom's body.
Doom leverages his experience into a deal with the American military, who force the Fantastic Four to work with Doom. Deducing that the Surfer's board is the source of his power, Reed develops a tachyon pulse generator that will separate him from it, while Victor works on an unknown remote-like machine. In the Black Forest, Sue is confronted by the Surfer, during which he reveals he is merely a servant to the destroyer of worlds, and regrets the destruction he causes. The military opens fire on the Surfer, which distracts him and allows the four to fire the pulse, separating the Surfer from his board. The military imprisons the Surfer in Siberia, while they torture him for information. Sue uses her powers to sneak into his cell, where she learns more information from the Surfer. He tells her his master was known by the people of his world as Galactus, a massive cloud-like cosmic entity which feeds on life-bearing planets to survive, and that his board is a homing beacon which is summoning Galactus to the planet. The Silver Surfer has to serve Galactus who will otherwise destroy not only his loved ones but his planet.
Doom, using the device he created earlier, steals the board from the compound, killing the majority of the Army presence there at the same time. The Fantastic Four rescue the Surfer, and pursue Doom in the Fantasticar, confronting him in Shanghai. During the battle, Sue is mortally wounded. With the Surfer powerless, Johnny absorbs the combined powers of the entire team in order to battle the cosmic energy-empowered Doom. Johnny succeeds in breaking Doom's control over the Surfer's board, and Ben Grimm (Michael Chiklis) uses a nearby crane to knock Doom into the harbor, however, Galactus has already arrived, and Sue dies in Reed's arms. The Surfer regains the control of his board, and his power is restored. He revives Sue and chooses to defend Earth, flying, with an extra boost from Johnny, into Galactus. The conflict results in a massive blast of energy that engulfs Galactus in a cosmic rift, and apparently kills the Surfer as well. Reed and Sue get married in Japan, and Johnny recovers his stable molecular state after touching the Surfer's board. In a post-credits scene, the Silver Surfer's seemingly lifeless body floats through space. His eyes then open and his board races towards him, indicating that he is alive.","fantasy,hero,trust,bum,on fire,anticipation,superhero",2405.jpg,2007-06-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/fantastic-four-rise-silver/id270698044?uo=4,Y3EC_V9A-rw,70047104,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Fantastic_Four_Rise_of_the_Silver_Surfer/70047104,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
2948,Fantastic Mr. Fox,"From director Wes Anderson comes his adaptation of beloved children's author Roald Dahl's novel about a fox battling angry farmers.  Devil-may-care Mr. Fox (voice of George Clooney) quits chicken thieving to start a family with Mrs. Fox (voice of Meryl Streep). Twelve years later, he leaves his columnist job to rob poultry from three mean farmers who then devise a plan to trap Mr. Fox and others in the burrowing animal community. With his friends and neighbors, Mr. Fox saves his animal community and beats the farmers at their own game.","While raiding a squab farm, Mr. Fox (George Clooney) and his wife Felicity (Meryl Streep) trigger a fox trap and become caged. Felicity reveals to Fox that she is pregnant and pleads with him to find a safer job when they escape.
Two years later (twelve in Fox Years), the Foxes and their sullen son Ash (Jason Schwartzman), are living in a hole. Fox, now a newspaper columnist, moves the family into a better home in the base of a tree, ignoring the warnings of his lawyer Badger (Bill Murray) about how dangerous the area is for foxes. The tree is located very close to facilities run by three mean farmers- Walter Boggis (Robin Hurlstone), Nathan Bunce (Hugo Guinness), and Franklin Bean (Michael Gambon). Soon after the Foxes move in, Fox's nephew Kristofferson (Eric Chase Anderson) comes to live with them, as his father has become very ill with double pneumonia. Ash finds this situation intolerable; his soft-spoken cousin is apparently superior to him at sports, and everyone, including his father, Mr Fox, is charmed by Kristofferson at Ash's expense.
Fox and the opossum who works as a building superintendent, Kylie Sven Opposum (Wallace Wolodarsky), steal produce and poultry from the three farms. The farmers decide to kill Fox and camp out near the family's tree. When he emerges the farmers open fire, but only manage to shoot off his tail. They then attempt to dig Fox out. After demolishing the site of the tree, the farmers discover the Foxes have dug an escape tunnel.
Reasoning that the Foxes will have to surface for food and water, the farmers lie in wait at the tunnel mouth. Underground, Fox encounters Badger and many other local animal residents whose homes have also been destroyed. As the animals begin fearing starvation, Fox leads a digging expedition to tunnel to the three farms, robbing them clean. While the other animals feast, Ash and Kristofferson, beginning to reconcile after Kristofferson defended Ash from a bully, return to Bean's farm, intending to reclaim Mr Fox's tail. When they are interrupted by the arrival of Bean's wife, Ash escapes but Kristofferson is captured.
Discovering that Fox has stolen their produce, the farmers flood the animals' tunnel network with cider. The animals are forced into the sewers, and Fox learns that the farmers plan to use Kristofferson to lure him into an ambush. The animals are confronted by Rat (Willem Dafoe), Bean's security guard. After a struggle with Fox leaves him mortally wounded, Rat divulges Kristofferson's location before he dies.
Fox asks the farmers for a meeting in town near the sewer hub; he will surrender in exchange for Kristofferson's freedom. The farmers set up an ambush, but Fox and the others anticipate it and launch a counterattack. Fox, Ash and Kylie slip into Bean‚Äö√Ñ√¥s farm. A much-matured Ash frees Kristofferson and braves enemy fire to release a rabid beagle to keep the farmers at bay.
The animals become accustomed to living in the sewers with others considering moving in. Ash and Kristofferson settle their differences and become good friends. Fox leads his family to a drain opening built into the floor of a supermarket owned by the three farmers. Celebrating their new food source and the news that Felicity is pregnant again, the animals dance in the aisles.","do the right thing,fantasy,hero,animal instincts,family,trust,joy,anticipation,animal",2948.jpg,2009-10-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/fantastic-mr.-fox/id336288777?uo=4,n2igjYFojUo,70109889,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Fantastic_Mr._Fox/70109889,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family"
3292,Far and Away,"A young man (Tom Cruise) leaves Ireland with his landlord's daughter (Nicole Kidman) after some trouble with her father, and they dream of owning land at the big giveaway in Oklahoma ca. 1893. When they get to the new land, they find jobs and begin saving money. The man becomes a local barehands boxer, and rides in glory until he is beaten, then his employers steal all the couple's money and they must fight off starvation in the winter, and try to keep their dream of owning land alive. Meanwhile, the woman's parents find out where she has gone and have come to America to find her and take her back.","Joseph Donnelly (Cruise), a hot-headed young man whose home was burned after his father's violent death, decides to take revenge on the ""high-handed"" Protestant landlord, Daniel Christie (Robert Prosky). In his attempt to kill him however, he is discovered by Daniel's daughter, Shannon Christie (Kidman) and is injured by her when he tries to escape. While injured he continues his plans to kill his landlord, but his rifle backfires due to rust. Held captive while they treat his wounds, Joseph tries to escape the house and is caught by Stephen Chase (Thomas Gibson), Daniel's arrogant manager, who had earlier burned the Donnelly house. Joseph spits on Stephen in anger and, disgraced, Stephen challenges Joseph to a duel of pistols at dawn. Meanwhile, Shannon, also Stephen's love interest, is growing dissatisfied with the traditional views of her parents' generation and longs to be modern, even going as far as to intentionally disgust her mother and their friends by playing American music on the piano. She makes plans to leave for America to claim land that's being given away for free. Joseph, though initially refusing to flee with her, is able to escape with her help. Shannon pays for Joseph's passage and he pretends to be her servant. This way, a single young woman is able to travel without question, and Joseph, now aware of the reality of the free land, can reach America to claim land. Shannon meets and talks to a seemingly kindly man on the ship named Mr. McGuire about the promise of land and her money issues. He informs her that to claim the free land, she must travel to Oklahoma and race for it along with others. Concerned with the expense of travel, she explains to him that she has no money, only expensive silver spoons. He tells her he will help her find a shop where she can sell her silver.
Upon arriving in Boston, McGuire steals her spoons and is shot by men who seem to have had previous trouble with him. The spoons are scattered in the street and stolen by passersby. Calling for help, Shannon is rescued by Joseph, who manages to save her bag and get her out of the streets. Taking charge of their situation, Joseph is led to the community of Irish living in the area and speaks to the man in charge, Ward Boss Mike Kelly. Through him, they find a room to live in and jobs in a chicken processing plant. Due to Shannon's wealthy background, which is hated by the lower class Irish they find themselves surrounded by, Joseph lies and tells everyone that she is in fact his sister, to save her from being exiled or hurt. Time passes and it becomes obvious that Joseph and Shannon have become attracted to each other, but both keep up a front of hostility. One night, after peeking at Shannon undress, Joseph finds himself sexually frustrated and rushes out and joins in a barehanded boxing match. Winning the match provides Joseph with newfound wealth and he becomes somewhat of a local celebrity. Meanwhile back in Ireland, the Christie house is burned down by unhappy taxpayers, so the Christies, with Stephen, decide to go to America to find their daughter.
Temporarily, Joseph seems to forget his goals of obtaining land and spends his money on suits and hats, in a thinly veiled attempt to impress Shannon. Shannon however, continues her work at the plant and mocks Joseph's prized hats. At one point, the pair have a spat and it becomes obvious that Joseph is upset that he's not managed to gain Shannon's approval or admiration. Shannon begins to question Joseph about his plans to acquire land and his lack of money the night before the largest fight of his career. He replies angrily that he easily earns money and will continue to do so. He spitefully tells her that he earns more money than she could ever dream to. She retorts she could earn just as much and disappears into their room. Later, right before the big fight, Joseph searches for Shannon, but is unable to find her. He's directed to his fight, told by others that she is there. Rushing to the site, he discovers she has become a burlesque dancer at the social club to earn more money. He attempts to ignore the men pushing him towards the ring and covers Shannon with his jacket, demanding that she stop dancing. Before he can finish with her, the men around plead with him to fight. The Irish men backing Joseph offer him a small fortune ($200) for this one last, great fight. Shannon, who previously scorned boxing, urges him to do it, since it would be enough money for them to leave and fulfill their wish of traveling to get land. Joseph agrees and begins to fight a large Italian fighter. All goes well until Joseph witnesses one of his backers (a member of the city council) forcing Shannon into his lap and groping her. Completely forgetting the fight, Joseph pushes his way through the crowd to free her. As he is pushed back into the ring his foot crosses the line, signaling he is ready to begin fighting, the Italian then beats Joseph. Because Joseph lost the fight he is then thrown out of the club. Joseph wakes up in an alley and sees Stephen Chase asking drunkards if they've seen Shannon. Joseph runs to his room to find the backers searching the room for any money he and Shannon had saved. They take the money and throw Joseph and Shannon out into the snow covered street, then tell the owner of the ""whorehouse"" that if she let them stay even one night, it will be shut down.
Cold and famished, they become desperate enough to enter a seemingly abandoned house of luxury. Joseph shows signs of sadness at the sight of their rich surroundings, knowing Shannon has suffered and deserves a better life. He encourages her to pretend the house is hers and offers to serve her. She's moved, but begs him to join her instead, and pretend with her, that they are married and the house is theirs. During the tender moment, they declare that they 'pretend' to love each other and kiss. At that moment the owners of the house return and chase them away from the property, shooting Shannon in the back in the process. Joseph brings Shannon to the Christies for help. Stephen scolds him for the state Shannon is in and ridicules him for thinking he could climb to her station and be with her. Deciding Shannon will be better cared for with her family and wealth, Joseph leaves Shannon despite his obvious feelings for her.
He heads west to work on the Transcontinental Railroad, seemingly abandoning his dream of owning land. After many months, Joseph is confronted one day by his father in a dream, and is reminded of his desire to own land. Joseph decides to join the wagon trains and arrives in Oklahoma Territory just in time for the Land Run of 1893, which will enable him to finally reach his goal. Shannon, now healthy and obviously well taken care of, is also there. Upon talking to her, he discovers she arrived on train, riding the very rails he built. She offers him luck and they part. Stephen, who witnesses the exchange, warns Joseph he will kill him if he goes near Shannon. Arriving late to the event, Joseph is forced to choose between two horses: the unruly stallion and the broken but slow horse. He chooses the broken horse, but it falls over and dies of old age later that night; he then is forced to ride the unruly horse. The day of the Run, as Joseph struggles to stay on his horse and is ridiculed by Stephen, Shannon gives him some advice, quickly ushered away by an unhappy Stephen. Joseph, frustrated that the horse won't listen, punches it and is able to ride it. During the race, Joseph chases after Shannon and Stephen, knowing that Stephen has broken the law and has already found a very rich spot of land to claim. While trying to get down a hill Shannon falls off her horse and Joseph rushes to her aid. Angered by this, Stephen races back towards them, instead of his goal, the land, and attempts to shoot him. They have a brief fight but Joseph manages to knock the gun from him and throw him from his horse. Shannon encourages Joseph to continue the race. As Joseph is ready to plant his flag into the ground, he hesitates despite Shannon's encouragements. Stephen rushes over and they have another fight in which Joseph falls to the ground and is crushed by a horse. Shannon rushes to his side and finally rejects Stephen when he questions her actions. Stephen leaves and Shannon is left to try to keep Joseph alive. Joseph finally confesses that he loves her, and without her, the land that was so important to him means nothing. He seems to die, and Shannon mourns, crying over his body. She tells him that she had always loved him, from the first moment she saw him. This suddenly revives him, similar to an earlier scene involving his father. They happily drive their flag into the ground and claim their prized land together.",,3292.jpg,1992-05-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/far-and-away/id316681385?uo=4,,492899,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Far_and_Away/492899,"Classics,Drama,Romance"

Brian tells his superiors that in exchange for Dominic's pardon, he will lure Braga into a trap, forcing him to personally show up to exchange money for the heroin.

3331,Fatal Attraction,"A married man's one night stand comes back to haunt him when that lover begins to stalk him and his family.

Stylish and sexy, Fatal Attraction took audiences to terrifying new heights with its thrilling story of a casual encounter gone terribly awry. This box-office smash was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Michael Douglas plays Dan Gallagher, a New York attorney who has a tryst with seductive Alex Forrest (Glenn Close) while his wife (Anne Archer) is away. Dan later shrugs off the affair as a mistake and considers it over. But Alex won't be ignored. Not now, not tomorrow, not ever‚Äö√Ñ√∂ even if it means destroying Dan's family to keep him.
","Dan Gallagher (Michael Douglas) is a successful, happily married New York attorney living in Manhattan when he meets Alexandra ""Alex"" Forrest (Glenn Close), an editor for a publishing company, through business. While his wife, Beth (Anne Archer), and daughter, Ellen (Ellen Hamilton Latzen), are out of town for the weekend, he has a passionate affair with Alex. Though he thought it was understood to be a simple fling, she begins clinging to him.
Dan explains that he must go home and Alex cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her to bandage them and later leaves. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invite him to the opera, but he turns her down. She then continues to telephone until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. She then phones his home at all hours, and then confronts him saying that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. She shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, he goes to her apartment to confront her about her actions which results in a violent scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.
Dan moves his family to Bedford, but this doesn't deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his vehicle, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their family life literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further. Dan approaches the police to apply for a restraining order against her (claiming that it is ""for a client""), to which the lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without probable cause and that the adulterer has to own up to his adultery.


Alex's rage eventually escalates into violence
At one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's pregnancy. Enraged, she asks him to leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that if she persists, she (Beth) will kill her. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen at school and takes her to an amusement park, buying her ice cream as well as taking her on a roller coaster. Beth panics when she realizes that she doesn't know where Ellen is. She drives around searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection and is slightly injured and hospitalized. Alex later drops Ellen off at the Gallaghers' house, asking Ellen for a kiss on the cheek.
Dan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her, but puts the knife down and leaves, with Alex leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. He approaches the police about having her arrested, and they start searching for Alex to bring her in for taking Ellen. Following her release from the hospital, Beth forgives Dan and they return home.
Beth prepares a bath for herself and Alex suddenly appears, again with the kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of her, nervously fidgeting (which causes her to cut her own leg) and then attacks her. Dan hears the screaming and runs in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife. Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun, shoots her in the chest, killing her. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes talking with the cops, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him.","sexy,obsessed,suspenseful,obsessive,obsession,tense,sexual,psycho,surprise,fear",3331.jpg,1987-09-11, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/fatal-attraction/id218728315?uo=4,mPK8tSgJGPY,60010341,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Fatal_Attraction/60010341,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

2325,Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"Ferris Bueller. Larger than life. Blessed with a magical sense of serendipity. He's a model for all those who take themselves too seriously. A guy who knows the value of a day off. Ferris Bueller's Day Off chronicles the events in the day of a rather magical young man, Ferris (Matthew Broderick). One spring day, toward the end of his senior year, Ferris gives in to an overwhelming urge to cut school and head for downtown Chicago with his girl (Mia Sara) and his best friend (Alan Ruck), to see the sights, experience a day of freedom and show that with a little ingenuity, a bit of courage and a red Ferrari, life at 17 can be a joy!","As the movie opens, high school senior Ferris Bueller (Matthew Broderick) decides to skip school on a nice spring day by faking an illness to his parents (Lyman Ward and Cindy Pickett). He goads his depressive best friend Cameron Frye (Alan Ruck) to join him, and despite Cameron's objections, they take Mr. Frye's prized 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California convertible in a ruse to get Ferris' girlfriend Sloane Peterson (Mia Sara) out of class. Word of Ferris' supposed dire illness spreads improbably through both the school and the city, and sympathy and donations for his care come in (a running gag throughout the film), but two people see through the deception: Ferris' sarcastic sister Jeanie (Jennifer Grey), outraged by his ability to get away with misbehavior, and the school's Dean of Students, Edward Rooney (Jeffrey Jones), who believes Ferris to be truant.
Ferris, Sloane, and Cameron drive into downtown Chicago, leaving the Ferrari with two garage attendants, who promptly take it on a joyride behind their backs. The three friends experience a charmed, carefree day in the the city, including lunch at a fancy restaurant, a Cubs game at Wrigley Field, and visits to the Sears Tower, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Ferris crashes the annual Von Steuben Day Parade, lip-synching on a float as the crowd joins him singing and dancing.
Meanwhile, Mr. Rooney goes off-campus to try to find Ferris. He goes to the Buellers' home where he is briefly fooled by Ferris' voice greeting him through the intercom, but quickly figures out that it's a recording rigged to the doorbell. In his efforts to gain entry to the house, he is chased by the family's dog, and his clothes are ruined. Jeanie returns home with the same intention, and they surprise each other inside. She mistakes him for an intruder and calls the police, but he leaves to chase down his car, which is being towed for parking in front of a fire hydrant. The police take Jeanie to the police station for filing a false report, where she talks to a drug addict (Charlie Sheen), who tells her that she needs to stop worrying so much about Ferris and more about herself. Jeanie becomes increasingly annoyed with the addict but is found kissing him when her mother arrives to pick her up.
At the end of the day, Ferris and friends retrieve the Ferrari, but discover on the way home that over a hundred miles have been added to the odometer. Cameron, fearing his father's reaction, freaks out and appears to go catatonic, but eventually responds, confessing that he'd been faking it, while contemplating how he has allowed his fear of his father to dominate his life. Back at Cameron's house, they jack up the rear wheels of the car and run the engine in reverse, but it does not remove the miles on the odometer as they expected. Cameron unleashes his pent-up anger against his father, kicking and damaging the front of the Ferrari. He realizes it is time for him to stand up to his father and vows to accept the consequences of the damage he has done. Calmly leaning against the car, he accidentally knocks it off the jack, and with its wheels still spinning in reverse, it crashes through the glass wall of the garage, landing in a ravine behind the house. Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron insists that he will take it himself.
Ferris walks Sloane home, and they begin to reflect on the day when Ferris realizes he has five minutes to get home before his parents discover him missing. As he runs home, he has close calls being spotted by each of his parents, and Jeanie (driving her mother home) races to get there first to expose him. He is caught at the back door by Mr. Rooney, who tells Ferris to expect another year of high school under his close personal supervision. However, Jeanie has found Rooney's wallet on the kitchen floor, and figured out that he was the intruder. With a change of heart, she uses this knowledge to tacitly blackmail him into letting the matter drop, and leaves him to be attacked by the dog. This gives Ferris just enough time to get back into bed before his parents check on him, leaving them convinced of his good character.
During the closing credits, Rooney hobbles down the street and is picked up by a school bus full of his students. At the end of the credits, Ferris emerges from the bathroom and chides the audience to go home.","whatif,freedom,ferrari,cameron,life is what happens,float,ohyeah,issit,cheeky,cutschool,agile,anticipation,miss it,belief,day off,drool,dayoff,fun,bunk,batta,look around,life moves pretty fast,sick,day,joy,abe froman,swing batta,get away with it,making other plans,believe,you killed the car.,sister,what if,bunking,missit,baby,fake,hypothesis,getawaywithit,ferris bueller,ferris,trust,senioryear,serendipity,bueller,save ferris,school,charisma,chancer,school friends,twist,your ass is mine,brother,miss",2325.jpg,1986-06-11, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/ferris-buellers-day-off/id285663978?uo=4,R-P6p86px6U,498716,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Ferris_Bueller_s_Day_Off/498716,Comedy
257,Field of Dreams,"""If you build it, he will come."" With these words, Iowa farmer Ray Kinsella (Kevin Costner) is inspired by a voice he can't ignore to pursue a dream he can hardly believe. Also starring Ray Liotta, James Earl Jones, and Amy Madigan, Field of Dreams is an extraordinary and unforgettable experience that has moved critics and audiences like no other film of its generation. Field of Dreams is a glowing tribute to all who dare to dream.","While walking in his cornfield, novice farmer Ray Kinsella hears a voice that whispers, ""If you build it, he will come"", and sees a baseball diamond. His wife, Annie, is skeptical, but she allows him to plow under his corn to build the field.
Nothing happens, and Ray soon faces financial ruin. Ray and Annie discuss replanting the corn, but their daughter, Karin, sees a man on the ballfield. Ray discovers that he is Shoeless Joe Jackson, a dead baseball player idolized by Ray's father. Thrilled to be able to play baseball again, Joe asks to bring others to play on the field. He later returns from the cornfield with the seven other players banned in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.
Ray's brother-in-law, Mark, cannot see the baseball players, and warns Ray that he will go bankrupt unless he replants his crops. While in the field, Ray hears the voice again, this time urging him to ""ease his pain."" After attending a PTA meeting involving a resolution to ban books by author and activist-turned recluse Terrence Mann, Ray decides the voice is referring to Mann. Ray finds a magazine interview about Mann's childhood dream of playing for the Brooklyn Dodgers and his heartbreak when the team moved to Los Angeles, and convinces Annie that he should seek out the author after they both dream about Ray and Terrence attending a baseball game.
Mann denies making the statement in the magazine, but Ray persuades him to attend a baseball game at Fenway Park. Ray hears the voice again, which urges him to ""go the distance."" The scoreboard shows statistics for a player named Archibald ""Moonlight"" Graham, who played one game for the New York Giants in 1922, but never had a turn at bat. Mann eventually admits to sharing the vision, and they travel to Chisholm, Minnesota where they learn that Graham became a doctor, but died 16 years earlier.
During a late night walk, Ray realizes that he is in 1972, the year of Graham's death; he finds Graham who confesses to him that although he regrets never getting to bat, he would have regretted not being a doctor even more. He declines Ray's invitation to fulfill his dream.


The Field of Dreams, Dyersville, IA‚Äö√Ñ√ÆMay 2006.
While driving back to Iowa, Ray picks up a young hitchhiker who introduces himself as Archie Graham. While Archie sleeps, Ray reveals that at age 14 he refused to play catch with his father after reading one of Terrence's books. He also says that at age 17, after an argument with his father about the criminality of the elder's hero ""Shoeless"" Joe Jackson, Ray left home and never saw his father again. At the farm, enough players have arrived to field two teams, and Archie finally gets to bat.
The next morning Mark implores Ray to sell the farm. Karin says that they won't need to because people will pay to watch the ball games. Terrence agrees that ""people will come"" to relive their childhood innocence, and Ray refuses to sell. Frustrated, Mark scuffles with Ray, accidentally knocking Karin off the top of the bleachers. Archie runs to help and, stepping off the field, becomes the old ""Doc"" Graham. After he saves Karin from choking, Ray realizes that Graham cannot return to the field as a young man. After reassuring Ray that his true calling was medicine, the players shake his hand and he leaves. Suddenly able to see the players, Mark urges Ray not to sell the farm.
After the game, Joe invites Terrence to enter the cornfield. Terrence accepts the offer and disappears into the cornfield, but Ray is angry at not being invited. Shoeless Joe rebukes his desire for a reward, then reminds him why he sacrificed so much, saying ""If you build it, he will come"", and glances toward home plate. The catcher removes his mask and Ray recognizes his father as a young man.
Ray introduces his father to Annie and Karin. As his father heads toward the cornfield, Ray asks his ""Dad"" to play catch. As they begin to play, hundreds of cars can be seen approaching the field, fulfilling Karin and Terrence's prophecy that people will come to watch baseball.","shoeless,popcorn,realize,whatif,cornfield,snap,he will come.,remove barriers,listen to voices,moonlight graham,lift spirit,risk it all,deja vu,farmer,baseball,family,shoeless joe jackson,iowa,terence mann,ease his pain,imagine,belief,dream,synch,realise dream,voices,surprise,leap,joe jackson,go the distance,dream come true,joy,my dad,hearing voices,build,believe,corn,farm,inspiring,get so close to their dream,build it and he will come,father son relationship,if you build it,hypothesis,miracle,sentimental,faith,vision,trust,second chance,the voice is back,reconciliation,baseball field,emotional,build it,touching,fsrm,feel good,stand in your way,he will come",257.jpg,1989-04-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/field-of-dreams/id279990601?uo=4,sHTsQ9qePrQ,499612,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Field_of_Dreams/499612,"Drama,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy,Sports & Fitness"

2642,Fight Club,"A ticking-time-bomb insomniac (Edward Norton) and a slippery soap salesman (Brad Pitt) channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Together they create a new ""fight club"" where young men come to relieve their frustrations by beating each other to a pulp. Their concept catches on, with underground ""fight clubs"" forming in every town, until a sensuous eccentric (Helena Bonham Carter) gets in the way and ignites an out-of control spiral toward oblivion.","The unnamed narrator (Norton) is a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from insomnia. His doctor refuses to give him medication and advises him to visit a support group to witness more severe suffering. The narrator attends a support group for testicular cancer victims and, after fooling them into thinking that he is a fellow victim, finds an emotional release that relieves his insomnia. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, but the presence of another impostor, Marla Singer (Bonham Carter), disturbs him, so he negotiates with her to avoid their meeting at the same groups.
After a flight home from a business trip, the narrator finds his apartment destroyed by an explosion. He calls Tyler Durden (Pitt), a soap salesman whom he befriended on the flight, and they meet at a bar. A conversation about consumerism leads to Tyler inviting the narrator to stay at his place; outside the bar he requests that the narrator hit him. The two engage in a fistfight, and the narrator subsequently moves into Tyler's dilapidated house. They have further fights outside the bar, and these attract a crowd of men. The fighting moves to the bar's basement where the men form a ""fight club"".
Marla overdoses on pills and telephones the narrator for help; he ignores her, but Tyler answers the call and saves her. Tyler and Marla become sexually involved, and Tyler warns the narrator never to talk to Marla about him. More fight clubs form across the country, and under Tyler's leadership, they become the anti-materialist and anti-corporate organization called ""Project Mayhem"". The narrator complains to Tyler that he wants to be more involved in the organization, but Tyler suddenly disappears. When a member of Project Mayhem is killed by the police during a botched sabotage operation, the narrator tries to shut down the project, and follows evidence of Tyler's national travels to track him down. In one city, a Project member greets the narrator as Tyler Durden. The narrator calls Marla from his hotel room and discovers that Marla also believes him to be Tyler. He suddenly sees Tyler in his room, and Tyler explains that they are dissociated personalities in the same body. When the narrator has believed himself to be asleep, Tyler has in fact been controlling his body.
The narrator blacks out after the conversation. When he wakes, he discovers from his telephone log that Tyler made calls during his blackout. He uncovers Tyler's plans to erase debt by destroying buildings that contain credit card companies' records. The narrator tries to contact the police but finds that the officers are members of the Project. He attempts to disarm explosives in a building, but Tyler subdues him and moves to a safe building to watch the destruction. The narrator, held by Tyler at gunpoint, realizes that in sharing the same body with Tyler, he himself is actually holding the gun. He fires it into his mouth, shooting through the cheek without killing himself. Tyler collapses with an exit wound to the back of his head, and the narrator stops mentally projecting him. Afterward, Project Mayhem members bring a kidnapped Marla to him, believing him to be Tyler, and leave them alone. The explosives detonate, collapsing the buildings, and the narrator and Marla watch the scene, holding hands.","sparring session,more...,fight,thought provoking,imaginary,stylized,less...,bleak,disturbing,splitpersonality,sparring,anticipation,offbeat,imagine,tense,insomniac,mind bending,rough,insomnia,imagaine,contemplative,therapy,atmospheric,fear,gloomy",2642.jpg,1999-09-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/fight-club/id290531770?uo=4,SUXWAEX2jlg,26004747,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Fight_Club/26004747,"Comedy,Drama"
1812,Finding Neverland,"In this drama, we are told the story of how J.M. Barrie came up with the play Peter Pan. After some failed attempts at creating a well written play, Barrie finds himself in a park playing with his dog. Several moments later he will come to meet the inspiration for his next play, four small boys and a widowed mother, who seems to be growing weaker by the day. Soon, the whole town is talking about Barrie and the Davies family, which causes some rough waters in his marriage. But what comes from his experiences is the play that comes to be known as Peter Pan.","The story focuses on Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, his platonic relationship with Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, and his close friendship with her sons, who inspire the classic play Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Never Grew Up.
Following the dismal reception of his latest play, Little Mary, Barrie meets the widowed Sylvia and her four young sons in Kensington Gardens, and a strong friendship develops between them. He proves to be a great playmate and surrogate father figure for the boys, and their imaginative antics give him ideas which he incorporates into a play about boys who do not want to grow up, especially one named after troubled young Peter Llewelyn Davies. His wife Mary, who eventually divorces him, and Sylvia's mother Emma du Maurier, object to the amount of time Barrie spends with the Llewelyn Davies family. Emma also seeks to control her daughter and grandsons, especially as Sylvia becomes increasingly weak from an unidentified illness.
Producer Charles Frohman skeptically agrees to mount Peter Pan despite his belief it holds no appeal for upper-class theatergoers. Barrie peppers the opening night audience with children from a nearby orphanage, and the adults present react to their infectious delight with an appreciation of their own. The play proves to be a huge success.
Because Sylvia is too ill to attend the production, Barrie arranges to have an abridged production of it performed in her home. She dies shortly afterward, and Barrie finds that her will is to have him and her mother to look after the boys; an arrangement agreeable to both.","anticipation,trust,joy",1812.jpg,2004-09-04, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/finding-neverland/id432475422?uo=4,,70001999,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Finding_Neverland/70001999,Drama
503,Fire in Babylon,An underdog story of how one of the most gifted teams in sporting history triumphed over its colonial masters. A celebration of the power of sports as a vehicle for social change set to a reggae beat featuring Bob Marley and others.,"The documentary describes the ascension of West Indies cricket from being a team largely composed of highly talented, entertaining, ""Calypso Cricketers"" to a determined unit that dominated world cricket for nearly twenty years.
It begins with an introduction to the West Indies Cricket Team. Using interviews with West Indian cricketing greats, and other people closely associated with West Indies cricket; the idea of culturally and politically different Caribbean nations playing under the common banner of the West Indies is described.
The history of cricket in the West Indies is briefly described, such as the appointment of Sir Frank Worrell as the first black man to captain the West Indies Cricket Team, and the emergence of such cricketing greats as Everton Weekes, Learie Constantine, and Sir Garfield Sobers. However talented these individual cricketers were, they were unable to fetch results, resulting in the West Indies being perceived as ""Calypso Cricketers""; people who were entertaining, but would ultimately lose.
The early 1970s saw the emergence of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said that when you have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.
Australians Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson destroyed the West Indies with their fast bowling. Frequent bouncers and intimidatory tactics led to the spirit of the team being shattered and the tour ended with Australia winning the six-match test series 5-1. At the end of the series, Clive Lloyd realizes that in order to win, it would be necessary for him to also cultivate fast bowlers as devastating as Lillee and Thomson.
When the Indian Cricket Team toured the West Indies in 1976, Clive Lloyd tested his new plan of attack, relentlessly getting his fast bowlers such as Andy Roberts, Michael Holding, and Colin Croft to bowl short-pitched or bouncers to Indian batsman. While playing at Kingston, Jamaica the Indian team declared on a second-innings lead of 12, after the management decided that they would rather not risk sending their bowlers such as Bishen Singh Bedi to face the fearsome fast bowling.
Convinced of the effectiveness of pace bowling as an instrument to success, Clive Lloyd's team departed to their Tour of England in 1976. England Captain Tony Greig's infamous ""grovel"" comment is shown in is entirety, and the effect it had on galvanising the team is described. After some highly aggressive fast bowling against the English batsmen, West Indian fast bowling is seen as being dangerous to the game. However, the West Indians feel that if the Australians could do it, so could they. Viv Richards is shown as dominating the Test series as a batsman, where he scored 829 runs in four tests with two double-centuries. Viv Richards' refusal to be intimidated by fast bowling is also seen as the ideal way for a batsman to deal with West Indian bowling.
The documentary then describes the struggle with their board for better pay, and how Kerry Packer eventually enticed the team to participate in World Series Cricket in 1977. World Series Cricket turns out to be a fore-runner of changes in cricket that only became permanent in the 1990s; such as coloured kits, day/night matches, and a greater emphasis on professionalism in play. The West Indian team emerges from the tournament fitter, stronger, and with a more professional outlook to the game.
The 1982 Rebel Tour to Apartheid -ruled South Africa is described. Colin Croft chooses to go, earning him a life ban from the West Indies Cricket Board. The main target of the regime, however, is international superstar Viv Richards. Richards states that he was offered ""a blank cheque"", but decided to not go as it would validate the state-sponsored racism pursued by the South African Government at the time.
It ends with a description of the West Indies' tour to England in 1984. With the emergence of fast bowling greats such as Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall to take the place of Croft, the West Indies becomes unstoppable. After Gordon Greenidge's innings of 214 not out at Lord's, the West Indians become an unstoppable force; defeating England 5-0 in the five-test series. In a turn on the regular term ""Whitewash"" to describe such a win, the series was instead dubbed Blackwash.
The documentary ends with a description of how the West Indians earned the respect, admiration, and love of cricket fans and even opposing teams from across the world. As the end credits roll, Michael Holding describes how between February, 1980 to March, 1995; the West Indies Cricket Team did not lose a single Test series.",,503.jpg, ,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/fire-in-babylon/id439608140?uo=4 ,,,,"Art House & International,Documentary,Sports & Fitness"

Winner of the World Cinema Directing and Screenwriting awards at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival, the film stars Liam Neeson (SCHINDLER‚Äö√Ñ√¥S LIST, TAKEN), James Nesbitt (BLOODY SUNDAY ), and Anamaria Marinca (4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS & 2 DAYS) in a compelling human drama about two men haunted by a tragic act of violence. In 1975, 17-year-old Alistair Little assassinated 19-year-old Jim Griffin. Jim‚Äö√Ñ√¥s murder was witnessed horrifically by his 11-year-old brother, Joe, and the impact of the death destroyed Joe and his family. Little was arrested, convicted and sent to prison. In this fictional exploration of the lives of real men, Alistair and Joe are given the opportunity to reconcile 30 years after the terrible event. Can a killer and his traumatized victim make peace? This indie drama is an IFC release.","Lurgan, Northern Ireland, 1975. The Northern Irish Troubles are underway, with the Irish Republican Army targeting British loyalists and the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force exacting revenge on Catholics they claim are militant republicans. Alistair Little, 17, is the leader of a UVF cell, eager to be blooded. He and his gang are given the go-ahead to kill a young Catholic man, James Griffin, as a reprisal and a warning to others. When the hit is carried out, Joe Griffin - the 8-year old little brother of the target - watches in horror as his brother is killed. Little goes to prison for 12 years.
Thirty-three years after the murder, Little and Joe Griffin are to meet, on camera, with a view to reconciliation. Little has served his sentence, and peace may have been agreed to in Northern Ireland, but Joe Griffin is not coming on the program for a handshake. Unbeknownst to the production team, he intends to murder his brother‚Äö√Ñ√¥s killer during the filmed meeting. However, he becomes emotional just before the meeting and demands that the cameras be removed, scuppering the project.

7197,Flight,"Airline pilot Whip Whitaker (Washington) miraculously lands his plane after a mid-air catastrophe. But even as he's being hailed for his heroic efforts, questions arise as to who or what was really at fault.","On October 14, 2011, Airline captain William ""Whip"" Whitaker (Denzel Washington) awakens in his Orlando hotel room with flight attendant Katerina M‚àö¬∞rquez (Nadine Velazquez) after a night of sex, alcohol, and very little sleep. After using cocaine to wake up, he boards SouthJet flight 227 to Atlanta. After Whip threads the plane through turbulence at takeoff, copilot Ken Evans (Brian Geraghty) flies the airplane while Whip discreetly mixes vodka in his orange juice and takes a nap. Whip is jolted awake just before their final descent and the aircraft goes into a steep dive as a result of an apparent catastrophic failure of control systems of the aircraft. With no other choice, Whip rolls the plane upside down to bring it out of the dive and maneuvers the plane right-side up just before crash-landing in a field. He loses consciousness upon impact.
Whip awakens in an Atlanta hospital with minor injuries. He is greeted by his old friend Charlie Anderson (Bruce Greenwood), who now represents the airline's pilots union. He tells Whip his heroism saved 96 of 102 people on board. A National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) official informs him Katerina was among those killed, and that Evans has been put into a coma.
Sneaking a cigarette in the stairwell, Whip meets Nicole (Kelly Reilly), who is recovering from a heroin overdose, and promises to visit her when they leave the hospital. In the morning, his friend and drug dealer, Harling Mays (John Goodman), picks him up and sneaks him away from the hospital. Whip drives to his late father's farm, where he hopes to avoid the media. When he meets Charlie and attorney Hugh Lang (Don Cheadle), they explain that the NTSB performed a toxicology screen while he was unconscious in the hospital that revealed he was intoxicated, which could result in Whip going to prison on drink, drugs and manslaughter charges. Lang promises to get the toxicology report ruled inadmissible on technical grounds, but Whip leaves in a fury and seeks out Nicole. He finds her skipping out on her lease and offers to let her stay at the farm.
Nicole and Whip begin a romantic relationship, but Nicole is trying to stay clean and sober while Whip's alcoholism progresses, and she soon leaves. The media discover his farmhouse, so he drives intoxicated to visit his ex-wife and teenage son, but they call the police. He begs to stay with Charlie, vowing not to drink before the upcoming NTSB hearing.
The night before the hearing, Charlie and Hugh check Whip into a guarded hotel room to ensure he does not get intoxicated. His mini-bar has only nonalcoholic beverages, but Whip discovers that the door to the adjoining room is open and finds alcohol in its mini-bar. Charlie and Hugh find him the next morning, passed out drunk. They call Harling, who brings him cocaine to perk him up for the hearing.
At the hearing, Ellen Block (Melissa Leo), the lead NTSB investigator, reveals that the cause of the plane's malfunction was a damaged jackscrew in the elevator assembly. She commends Whip on his valor. Just as it appears Whip will escape culpability, Block raises the fact that there were two empty alcohol containers found in the trash on the plane; Whip knows these were his. Block points out that only the flight crew had access to the alcohol, and since only Katerina's toxicology screen showed alcohol, Block asks Whitaker whether he thinks Katerina may have been drinking on the job. Refusing to taint Katerina's good name, Whip admits not only that he was flying intoxicated but also that he is intoxicated at the hearing.
Thirteen months later, an imprisoned Whip, serving a minimum five-year sentence, tells a support group of fellow inmates that he is glad to be sober and does not regret doing the right thing, because he finally feels ""free"". He has kept in touch with Nicole and is reconnecting with his estranged son.",,7197.jpg,2012-11-02,https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/flight/id583674826?uo=4,xnVNNR6CEOE,70243453,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Flight/70243453,Drama

He weeps, he rails, he mopes. Finally, his step-brother Brian suggests Hawaii, so Peter heads for a resort on Oahu where, as he's checking in, he sees Sarah and her new beau, Aldous, a polymorphously perverse English rocker. The weeping and moping start again, until Peter is rescued by Rachel, a thoughtful hotel clerk who invites him to a luau and to hang out. Although he constantly runs into Sarah and Aldous, Peter starts to come alive again. Will Sarah realize what she's lost, and what about Rachel? ","Composer Peter Bretter (Jason Segel) is in a five-year relationship with actress Sarah Marshall (Kristen Bell), who stars in a CSI-like television show, ""Crime Scene: Scene of the Crime."" One day, as Peter stands stark naked in their apartment, Sarah announces that she is breaking up with him. Devastated, and unable to banish his grief through one-night stands, Peter takes a trip to Hawaii. However, the vacation is ruined when he learns that Sarah and her new boyfriend Aldous Snow (Russell Brand), lead singer of the English rock band Infant Sorrow, are also guests of the resort. Taking pity on him, hotel concierge Rachel (Mila Kunis) offers him an expensive suite for free in exchange for cleaning up the room himself.
Peter begins spending time with Rachel and starts to develop feelings for her. Meanwhile, the relationship between Sarah and Aldous begins to falter. Much of the discord is triggered by the news that Sarah‚Äö√Ñ√¥s TV show has been canceled and Aldous is about to embark on a World Tour with his group, Infant Sorrow. During a day of surf and sand Aldous and Peter run into each other and begin talking. Inadvertently, Aldous informs Peter that he and Sarah began having sex a full year before she broke up with Peter. When Peter confronts Sarah, she tells him she began feeling disconnected emotionally from him and she couldn't do anything to make their relationship work. Further exacerbating the situation is Sarah's obvious jealousy of the budding relationship between Peter and Rachel.
Later, Sarah, Aldous, Peter and Rachel share an awkward dinner together. After the dinner, Peter takes Rachel back to his hotel room and they begin to fool around. Sarah hears them through the wall and initiates sex with Aldous, moaning loudly for the benefit of the couple next door, and Rachel and Peter turn the situation into a game and become even louder.

602,Forks Over Knives,"What has happened to us? Despite the most advanced medical technology in the world, we are sicker than ever by nearly every measure. Cases of diabetes are exploding, especially amongst our younger population. About half of us are taking at least one prescription drug and major medical operations have become routine. Heart disease, cancer and stroke are the country's three leading causes of death, even though billions are spent each year to ""battle"" these very conditions. Millions suffer from a host of other degenerative diseases. Could it be there's a single solution to all of these problems? A solution so comprehensive, but so utterly straightforward, that it's mind-boggling that more of us haven't taken it seriously? FORKS OVER KNIVES examines the profound claim that most, if not all, of the so-called ""diseases of affluence"" that afflict us can be controlled, or even reversed, by rejecting our present menu of animal-based and processed foods. The major storyline in the film traces the personal journeys of Dr. T. Colin Campbell, a nutritional scientist from Cornell University, and Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, a former top surgeon at the world renowned Cleveland Clinic. Inspired by remarkable discoveries in their young careers, these men conducted several groundbreaking studies, one of which is considered among the most comprehensive health-related investigations ever undertaken. Their research separately and independently led them to the same startling conclusion: degenerative diseases like heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and even several forms of cancer, could almost always be prevented-and in many cases reversed-by adopting a whole foods, plant-based diet. Despite the profound implications of their findings, their work has remained relatively unknown to the public. In addition, cameras follow ""reality patients"" who have chronic conditions from heart disease to diabetes. Doctors teach these patients how to adopt a whole foods plant-based diet as the primary approach to treat their ailments-while the challenges and triumphs of their journeys are revealed. ","Documentary filmmaker Lee Fulkerson explores the possibility that so-called ""diseases of affluence,"" such as heart disease, can be reversed by simply adjusting our diets to include less processed and animal-based foods. Back in the 1960s, Cornell University nutritional scientist Dr. T. Colin Campbell was working to find a way to feed the citizens of impoverished Third World nations when a trip to the Philippines forever changed the way he thought about food consumption. There, he discovered that the rates of liver cancer among affluent children who subsisted on diets rich in animal-based foods were notably higher than in children consuming plant-based diets. Meanwhile, surgeon Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, head of the Breast Cancer Task Force at Cleveland Clinic, was also discovering that many of the diseases he was seeing in patients were practically nonexistent in areas of the world where people were primarily consuming plant foods. Several subsequent investigations by the researchers (who would not meet each other until the 1980s), including a groundbreaking study in China by Dr. Campbell, led them to the revelation that a whole-food, plant-based diet could prevent, and even reverse, such degenerative conditions as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and some forms of cancer. In this film, Fulkerson examines Dr. Campbell's and Dr. Esselstyn's theories by following the two doctors' individual, yet very similar, story arcs, from their farm-based upbringings to their astounding discoveries. The film also records the experiences of a group of patients suffering from chronic maladies as they participate in an experiment in which their diets are substantially altered and wholesome, plant-based food is, essentially, used as medicine. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","disturbing,thought provoking,contemplative",602.jpg,2011-05-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/forks-over-knives/id450997854?uo=4,"F-OzTWY2J8E,F-OzTWY2J8E",70185045,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Forks_Over_Knives/70185045,"Documentary,Special Interest,Sports & Fitness"

Using money from a ping pong endorsement, Forrest buys a shrimping boat, fulfilling his wartime promise to Bubba. Dan keeps his own promise and joins Forrest as first mate. They initially have little luck; but, after Hurricane Carmen destroys every other shrimping boat in the region, the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company becomes a huge success due to the elimination of competition. Having had an epiphany during the hurricane, Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Forrest then returns home to care for his ailing mother, who dies soon afterwards. Forrest leaves the company in the hands of Dan, who invests their wealth in shares of Apple, making them both millionaires.
Jenny returns to visit Forrest and stays with him. Forrest asks her to marry him, but she declines and slips away early one morning after the pair make love. Distraught, Forrest decides to go for a run, which turns into a three-year coast-to-coast marathon. Forrest becomes a celebrity and attracts followers. One day he stops suddenly and returns home. He receives a letter from Jenny asking to meet, which brings him to the bus stop where he began telling his story. Once he and Jenny are reunited, Forrest discovers they have a young son, also named Forrest(Haley Joel Osment). Jenny reveals that she is suffering from an unknown virus. She proposes to him and he accepts. They return to Alabama with Forrest Jr. and marry. Their joy is short lived however, when Jenny dies on March 22, 1982. At the end of the film, Forrest waits with Forrest Jr. for the bus to pick him up for his first day of school. As the bus drives away, Forrest sits on the same tree stump where his mother sat on his first day of school and watches his feather bookmark float off in the wind.","whatif,relax,uplifting,innocent,overcome,rightplacerighttime,rescue,stupid,childlike,feather,lean startup,fate,feelgood,keep running,agile,leanstartup,anticipation,leanux,ping,hero,luck,just do it,lean,good mood,chocolates,never know,elvis,apple,charmed,surprise,natural,allow,more...,joy,simple,run,fortunate,believe,mvp,captivating,cadbury,captain,pong,risk,naive,pivot,real,less...,hippies,happy,bit me in the butt,disability,overcome obstacles,save lives,butt,bubba,right place right time,lean ux,sentimental,running fool,faith,sincere,trust,shrimp,tabletennis,vietnam,serendipity,human,chocolate,stupid is as stupid does,gump,box of chocolates,smiley,touching,right place,shrimp boat,contemplative,pingpong,bright side,feel good,clever,bittersweet,bullet,antihero,be good",1012.jpg,1994-06-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/forrest-gump/id314029341?uo=4,P0oNzk3LhHk,60000724,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Forrest_Gump/60000724,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"
3732,Fort Apache,"Academy Award-winner Henry Fonda is a fanatical cavalry commander of a remote outpost bent on leading his men to slaughter. The first segment of Academy Award-winning director/producer John Ford's (""She Wore A Yellow Ribbon,"" ""Rio Bravo,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath"") cavalry trilogy features an all-star cast that includes Fonda (""On Golden Pond,"" ""The Grapes of Wrath""), Oscar-winners John Wayne (""Stagecoach,"" ""True Grit,"" ""The Searchers""), Shirley Temple (""The Little Princess"") and Victor McLaglen (""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon""). Features outstanding outdoor photography and nail-biting action.","After the American Civil War, highly-respected veteran Captain Kirby York (John Wayne) is expected to replace the outgoing commander at Fort Apache, an isolated U.S. cavalry post. York had commanded his own regiment during the Civil War and was well-qualified to assume permanent command. To the surprise and disappointment of the company, command of the regiment was given to Lieutenant Colonel Owen Thursday (Henry Fonda). Thursday, a West Point graduate, was a general during the Civil War. Despite his Civil War combat record, Lieutenant Colonel Thursday lacks experience with the Indians he is expected to oversee, and is an arrogant and egocentric officer.
Accompanying widower Thursday is his daughter, Philadelphia (Shirley Temple). She becomes attracted to Second Lieutenant Michael Shannon O'Rourke (John Agar), the son of Sergeant Major Michael O'Rourke (Ward Bond). The elder O'Rourke was a recipient of the Medal of Honor as a major with the Irish Brigade during the Civil War, entitling his son to enter West Point and become an officer. However, the class-conscious Thursday forbids his daughter to see someone he does not consider a gentleman.
When there is unrest among the Indians, led by Cochise (Miguel Inclan), Thursday ignores York's advice to treat the natives with honor and to remedy problems on the reservation caused by corrupt Indian agent Silas Meacham (Grant Withers). Thursday's inability to deal with Meacham effectively, due to his rigid interpretation of Army regulations stating that Meacham is an agent of the United States government and therefore entitled to Army protection (despite his own personal contempt for the man), coupled with Thursday's prejudicial and arrogant ignorance regarding the Apache drives the Indians to rebel. Eager for glory and recognition, Thursday orders his regiment into battle on Cochise's terms, a direct charge into the hills, despite York's urgent warnings that such a move would be suicidal. Thursday relieves York and orders him to stay back, replacing him with Captain Sam Collingwood (George O'Brien).
Following Thursday's orders, York spares the younger O'Rourke from battle. Thursday's entire command is nearly wiped out, but a few soldiers manage to escape back to the ridge where Captain York is positioned. Thursday himself survives but then returns to die with the last of his trapped men. Cochise spares York and the rest of the detachment because he knows York to be an honorable man.
Subsequently, now Lieutenant-Colonel Kirby York commands the regiment. Meeting with correspondents, he introduces Lt. O'Rourke, now married to Philadelphia Thursday. A reporter asks Colonel York if he has seen the famous painting depicting ""Thursday's Charge."" York, about to command a new and arduous campaign to bring in the Apaches, while believing that Thursday was a poor tactician and foolhardedly led a suicidal charge, says it is completely accurate and then reminds the reporters that the soldiers will never be forgotten as long as the regiment lives.","rough,captivating",3732.jpg,1948-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/fort-apache/id317661569?uo=4,5d3a_gKeeZk,,,"Classics,Western"

3563,Four Brothers,"Four adopted brothers come to avenge their mother's death in what appears to be a random killing in a grocery store robbery. However, the boys' investigation of the death reveals more nefarious activities involving the one brother's business dealings with a notorious local hoodlum. Two cops who are trying to solve the case may also not be what they seem.","The seemingly random murder of their adoptive mother, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), in a convenience store brings four brothers from Detroit, Michigan back home to find out what happened. Originally under the impression the crime was a simple robbery-gone-wrong, the brothers soon discover that the robbery was merely a cover for what was, in fact, a hit put out on Evelyn. After this revelation, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andr‚àö¬© Benjamin) and Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) track down the hired guns who killed Evelyn. Refusing to say anything, they are unceremoniously executed by Bobby and Angel.
The next day, Detroit Police Lieutenant Green (Terrence Howard) and Detective Fowler (Josh Charles) confront the brothers about the murders. Lieutenant Green warns them that their interference with Evelyn‚Äö√Ñ√¥s case is ill advised, and that it will eventually put them in over their heads. After confronting Jeremiah, the brothers are treated to a somewhat different version of events. Jeremiah informs them that his construction company was failing precisely because he was not getting involved with Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and that for a project to succeed he had to pay off the right people, which he initially failed to do. In his effort to restore his business and relieve pressure from himself, he tried to pay off Sweet's henchmen. As for the life insurance, Jeremiah explains that the money went directly to him for his daughters, because he paid all of Evelyn's bills while his other brothers were not around.
Back at their home, Sweet‚Äö√Ñ√¥s men attack the brothers. Jack dies from gunshot wounds during the attack. Bobby finds one of the gunmen still alive and questions him about who sent them, then executes him. When Lt. Green arrives, he tells them not to worry, and assures them it will go down as self-defense. He also informs them that Evelyn filed a police report regarding Victor Sweet and his involvement in Jeremiah's affairs, and his partner, Detective Fowler, passed on that report to Sweet. Green warns the brothers to stay out of the matter and let him handle Fowler and then they will work together on Sweet. Later at a bar Green confronts Fowler, hitting him and ordering Fowler to hand in his badge. They walk out of the bar, and Fowler kills Green and calls it into dispatch claiming two assailants had fired upon Green.
Meanwhile, the remaining brothers devise a plan to buy Victor Sweet off with the $400,000 from their mother's life insurance. When Sweet accepts, Angel sets off for Fowler's. Arriving at Fowler's, he subdues him. Jeremiah then goes to meet Sweet, while Angel's girlfriend, Sofi, heads to the police station, where she tells the police that Angel is planning to kill a police officer. Hearing the sirens in the distance, Fowler thinks they are coming for Angel, until Angel removes his jacket showing a wire however, with no receiver. Angel claims the whole conversation was taped, including Fowler's admission that he killed Green. The police arrive at Fowler's in full force, and Fowler gets the upper hand on Angel. With a gun pointed to Angel‚Äö√Ñ√¥s head, Fowler tells the police to back off. Fowler opens fire on the officers outside, who return fire and kill him.
Meanwhile, Jeremiah meets with Sweet and reveals that the $400,000 are to buy off Sweet's henchmen and kill Sweet in exchange. Sweet angrily demands to know who will be the one to kill him just as Bobby shows up. Bobby and Sweet brawl, resulting in Bobby knocking Sweet unconscious. His former henchmen seal his fate after he is dropped in a hole carved into the ice, drowning him. The three brothers, now in police custody, are beaten in an attempt to make them confess to the murder of Victor Sweet, which they do not. Back home, they set about repairing their mother's house, and continuing their lives together.","mama,murder,revenge,sentimental,sadness,rough,mom,mamasboy,mother,anger,family,mummy,brother,brothers,fear",3563.jpg,2005-08-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/four-brothers/id252803832?uo=4,nLbEGkjmTxg,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama"
1828,Four Lions,"Four Lions tells the story of a group of British jihadists who push their abstract dreams of glory to the breaking point. As the wheels fly off, and their competing ideologies clash, what emerges is an emotionally engaging (and entirely plausible) farce. In a storm of razor-sharp verbal jousting and large-scale set pieces, Four Lions is a comic tour de force; it shows that - while terrorism is about ideology - it can also be about idiots.","A handful of young men set out to take on the decadent West but are more of a threat to themselves than anyone else in this black comedy from director Chris Morris. Omar (Riz Ahmed) is a devout Muslim living in the United Kingdom who has decided to form a terrorist cell to bring forth a jihad against a culture he believes is dominated by the sinful and ignorant. However, Omar isn't much of leader, and he's assembled an unimpressive team of fellow terrorists, among them Waj (Kayvan Novak), who lacks the brainpower to come up with ideas or direction on his own; Faisal (Adeel Akhtar), who is shy and doesn't have much to say; and Barry (Nigel Lindsay), a recent convert to Islam who tries to make up for his lack of practical knowledge with fierce passion. As Omar and his comrades debate both doctrine and methods, they ponder such notions as using birds as explosive devices, creating video communiques with a hip-hop flavor, and attacking mosques in an effort to provoke nonviolent Muslims. But are Omar and his partners a legitimate threat to the safety of Great Britain, or just four half-bright twentysomethings with more bluster than imagination?

3454,Frank and Ollie,"""Their friendship changed the face of animation."" What is interesting is that these two were planning on anything but becoming animators much less becoming innovators in the profession. They met at Stanford as college students and took road trips to a distant college to do nudes because Stanford would not allow ""such behavior"" in their art department (imagine that today). Somewhere during these trips a lasting friendship was built between them. The ""painted for dinner and played piano for beer"" along the way on these trips and seem to have made many friends in the places they frequented as well. Their lack of fear, presence of love and capacity to laugh at themselves opened one door after another. I was amused time and again to see them model the characters they created. It was also quite interesting to see how they climbed inside of their characters and brought them to life. It was apparent to me that they enjoyed what they were doing and in-so-doing were blessed to be eternally youthful. I am hard pressed to think of another friendship that would allow two human beings to share so much without petty jealousy getting in the way. Their wives were incredibly understanding about the childlike ways and seemed to understand what a blessing their husbands were, not only to their family, but to the world in general. There is not a country on the face of this earth that has not seen one of their characters, I would suppose. I would also gather that they have touched many millions of young hearts over the years. A young heart, by the way, need not be in a young body. That was apparent in this film as well. I will never see Disneyland the same, because behind each of the characters that I see, I will imagine the facial expressions of these two men. I will remember that one got his best ideas while shaving and developed the ideas while walking on a worn path in his front yard. They did talk about artistic frustration brought on by the fact that they were so involved and connected to what they do. It was also interesting to note that their release from tension was also artistically motivated and expressed through music and model railroading. I thoroughly enjoyed this viewing and will never forget the wisdom chiseled into the faces and depth sparkling from the eyes of these two wonderful human beings.","Frank and Ollie is a 1995 documentary film about the life and careers of Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, two chief animators who had worked atWalt Disney Animation Studios during its early years, up until their retirement in the late 1970s.
The film primarily consists of Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston's anecdotes of their careers as animators during their long tenure at Walt Disney Studios, beginning with their hiring a couple of years before the release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. They talk about the successes and difficulties of the Walt Disney studios throughout their careers, including the production of Disney's early works such as Pinocchio and Fantasia, decrease in business due to World War II, the unexpected death of Walt Disney in 1966, and the importance of The Jungle Book's success in 1967. These anecdotes are punctuated by archival footage from various Disney films, as well as interviews with contemporary Disney animators, animation historians, and interviews with Frank and Ollie's wives. Footage of Frank and Ollie's daily lives at their nearby homes in La Ca‚àö¬±ada Flintridge, California is also featured.
Periodically in the film, Frank or Ollie (usually Ollie) will act out or describe a scene from a Disney film that they animated, and then show the scene from the film. This demonstrates the importance of acting in animation. Several of their anecdotes were also about how other animators did their scenes. The film also talks about Disney's Nine Old Men, the senior staff at Walt Disney Studios. Ollie Johnston's beloved model railroad and the book Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life, written by Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, also feature prominently in the film.

1840,Frankenstein,Two hundred years after Mary Shelley's novel the brilliant but mad Doctor (Thomas Kretschmann) has sustained his creature and himself over two centuries through genetic experimentation. In present-day America Detective O'Connor (Parker Posey) is investigating a series of horrific murders which leads her to the doctor and his creature. What she uncovers reveals the strange evolution the doctor and his creation undergo over the course of two centuries and the divergent paths creator and monster take in pursuing good or evil.,"Heinrich ""Henry"" Frankenstein (Colin Clive), an ardent young scientist, and his devoted assistant Fritz (Dwight Frye), a hunchback, piece together a human body, the parts of which have been secretly collected from various sources. Frankenstein's consuming desire is to create human life through various electrical devices which he has perfected.
Elizabeth (Mae Clarke), his fianc‚àö¬©e, is worried to distraction over his peculiar actions. She cannot understand why he secludes himself in an abandoned watch tower, which he has equipped as a laboratory, refusing to see anyone. She and her friend, Victor Moritz (John Boles), go to Dr. Waldman (Edward Van Sloan), his old medical professor, and ask Dr. Waldman's help in reclaiming the young scientist from his absorbing experiments. Waldman tells them that Frankenstein has been working on creating life. Elizabeth, intent on rescuing Frankenstein, arrives just as Henry is making his final tests. He tells them to watch, claiming to have discovered the ray that brought life into the world. They all watch Frankenstein and the hunchback as they raise the dead creature on an operating table, high into the room, toward an opening at the top of the laboratory. Then a terrific crash of thunder, the crackling of Frankenstein's electric machines, and the hand of Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff) begins to move. This causes Frankenstein to shout 'It's alive!'
Through the incompetence of Fritz, a criminal brain was secured for Frankenstein's experiments instead of the desired normal one. The manufactured monster, despite its grotesque form, initially appears not to be a malevolent beast but a simple, innocent creation. Frankenstein welcomes it into his laboratory and asks his creation to sit, which it does. He then opens up the roof, causing the monster to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz, however, enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the monster. Its fright is mistaken by Frankenstein and Dr. Waldman as an attempt to attack them, and so it is taken to the dungeon where it is chained. Thinking that it is not fit for society and will wreak havoc at any chance, they leave the monster locked up, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. As Henry and Dr. Waldman consider the fate of the monster, they hear a shriek from the dungeon. Frankenstein and Dr. Waldman rush in to find the monster has strangled Fritz. The monster makes a lunge at the two but they escape the dungeon, locking the monster inside. Realizing that the creature must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the monster and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the creature emerges and lunges at Frankenstein as Dr. Waldman injects the drug into the creature's back. The monster knocks Dr. Waldman to the floor and has nearly killed Henry when the drug takes effect, and he falls to the floor unconscious.
Henry leaves to prepare for his wedding while Dr. Waldman conducts an examination of the unconscious creature. As he is preparing to begin dissecting it, the creature awakens and strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape. It then has a short encounter with a farmer's young daughter, Maria (Marilyn Harris), who asks him to play a game with her in which they playfully toss flowers into a lake and watch them float. The monster enjoys the game, but when they run out of flowers, tragedy occurs. Due to his defective brain, the monster thinks Maria (unable to swim) will float as well as the flowers, so he picks her up and throws her into the lake, and the girl drowns. Realizing he has made a terrible mistake, the monster walks away feeling troubled and remorseful. This drowning scene is one of the most controversial in the film, with a long history of censorship.
With preparations for the wedding completed, Frankenstein is once again himself and serenely happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Dr. Waldman arrives. Victor rushes in, saying that the Doctor has been found strangled in his operating room. Frankenstein suspects the monster. A chilling scream convinces him that the monster is in the house. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth unconscious on the bed. The monster has escaped. He is intent only upon destroying Frankenstein.
Meanwhile, Maria's father arrives, carrying the body of his daughter. He says she was murdered, and an enraged band of peasants search the surrounding country for the monster. They are split into three groups, Frankenstein leading one into the mountains. He becomes separated from the band and is discovered by the monster who, after the two stare each other down for a curious moment, attacks him. After a struggle, in which Frankenstein's torch fails to save him, the monster knocks Frankenstein unconscious and carries him off to the old mill. The peasants hear his cries and follow. Upon reaching the mill, they find the monster has climbed to the very top, dragging Frankenstein with him. In a burst of rage, he hurls the young scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the vanes of the windmill, saving him from instant death. Some of the villagers hurry him to his home while the others remain to burn the mill and destroy the entrapped monster.
Later, back at Castle Frankenstein, Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein (Frederick Kerr) celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.","scary,suspenseful,sadness,atmospheric,fear",1840.jpg,1931-11-21,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/frankenstein/id254461503?uo=4 ,bKyiXjyVsfw,,,"Classics,Horror,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
7264,Frankenweenie,"From Disney and creative genius Tim Burton (Alice in Wonderland, The Nightmare Before Christmas) comes the hilarious and offbeat Frankenweenie, a heartwarming tale about a boy and his dog. After unexpectedly losing his beloved dog Sparky, young Victor harnesses the power of science to bring his best friend back to life with just a few minor adjustments. He tries to hide his home-sewn creation, but when Sparky gets out, Victor's fellow students, teachers and the entire town learn that getting a new ""leash on life"" can be monstrous. Complete with electrifying bonus features, Frankenweenie is alive with enchanting fun for the whole family.

Young Victor conducts a science experiment to bring his beloved dog Sparky back to life, only to face unintended, sometimes monstrous, consequences.

When young Victor's pet dog Sparky (who stars in Victor's home-made monster movies) is hit by a car, Victor decides to bring him back to life the only way he knows how. But when the bolt-necked ""monster"" wreaks havoc and terror in the hearts of Victor's neighbors, he has to convince them (and his parents) that despite his appearance, Sparky's still the good loyal friend he's always been.
","Young filmmaker and scientist Victor Frankenstein (Charlie Tahan) lives with his parents, Ben and Susan Frankenstein (Martin Short and Catherine O'Hara) and dog Sparky in the quiet town of New Holland. Victor's intelligence is recognized by his classmates at school, his somber next-door neighbor, Elsa Van Helsing (Winona Ryder), mischievous, Igor-like Edgar ""E"" Gore (Atticus Shaffer), obese and gullible Bob (Robert Capron), overconfident Toshiaki (James Hiroyuki Liao), creepy Nassor (also Short), and an eccentric girl nicknamed Weird Girl (also O'Hara), but communicates little with them due to his relationship with his dog. Concerned with his son's isolation, Victor's father encourages him to take up baseball and make achievements outside of science. Victor hits a home run at his first game, but Sparky, pursuing the ball, is killed by a car.
Inspired by his science teacher Mr. Rzykruski's (Martin Landau) demonstration of the effect of electricity on dead frogs, a depressed Victor digs up Sparky's corpse, brings him to his makeshift laboratory in the attic, and successfully reanimates him with lightning. Seeing Weird Girl's living cat, Mr. Whiskers, the undead Sparky escapes from the attic and explores the neighborhood. He is recognized by Edgar, who blackmails Victor into teaching him how to raise the dead. The two reanimate a dead goldfish, which turns invisible due to an error with the experiment. Edgar brags about the undead fish to Toshiaki and Bob, which, in panic of losing the upcoming science fair, inspires them to make a rocket out of soda bottles, which causes Bob to injure his arm and Mr. Rzykruski to be blamed and fired due to his accused influencing and reviling the townsfolk for questioning his methods when he steps up for self-defence.
Eventually, Edgar's fish disappears when he tries to show it to a skeptical Nassor (who was told by Toshiaki) and when Edgar is confronted by Toshiaki, Nassor, and Bob on the baseball field at school, he reveals Victor's actions, inspiring them to try reanimation themselves. Victor's parents discover Sparky in the attic and are frightened, causing the dog to flee. Victor and his parents search for Sparky while the classmates invade the lab, discovering Victor's reanimation formula. The classmates separately perform their experiments, which go awry and turn the dead animals into monsters‚Äö√Ñ√ÆMr. Whiskers holds a dead bat while it is electrocuted, turning him into a vampire cat; Edgar turns a dead rat he found in the garbage into a wererat; Nassor revives his mummified hamster Colossus; Toshiaki's turtle Shelley is covered in a growth formula and turns into a giant Gamera-like monster; and Bob's Sea-Monkeys grow into amphibious humanoid monsters. The monsters break loose into the town fair where they wreak havoc.
After finding Sparky at the town's pet cemetery, Victor sees the monsters attacking the fair and goes to help his classmates deal with them‚Äö√Ñ√Æ-the Sea-Monkeys explode after eating salt-covered popcorn, and Colossus is stepped on by Shelley, while the rat and Shelley are returned to their original, deceased forms after being electrocuted. During the chaos, the town's mayor's niece Elsa van Helsing is grabbed by Mr. Whiskers and carried to the town windmill. The townsfolks blame Sparky for her disappearance and chase him to the windmill, which Mayor Bergermeister (also Short) accidentally ignites with his torch. Victor and Sparky enter the burning windmill and rescue Elsa, but Victor is trapped inside. Sparky rescues Victor, only to be dragged back inside by Mr. Whiskers. A final confrontation ensues, and just as Mr. Whiskers has Sparky cornered, a flaming piece of wood breaks off and impales him. The windmill collapses on Sparky, killing him again. To reward him for his bravery, the townsfolk gather to revive Sparky with their car batteries, reanimating him once more. Persephone, Elsa's pet poodle, who has a hair style similar to the Elsa Lanchester's Bride of Frankenstein, comes to Sparky as the two dogs share their love.",,7264.jpg,2012-10-05,https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/frankenweenie/id570830865?uo=4,H1yR-gEldC4,70219496,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Frankenweenie/70219496,"Horror,Comedy,Kids & Family,Animation"

3877,Freedom Writers,"Assigned the thankless task of teaching freshman English at a gang-infested Long Beach, CA high school, a 23-year-old teacher resorts to unconventional means of breaking through to her hardened students in director Richard LaGravenese's adaptation of Erin Gruwell's best-seller, The Freedom Writer's Diaries: How a Teacher and 150 Teens Used Writing to Change Themselves and the World Around Them. Her students had been written off, and her chances of succeeding scoffed at, but Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank) wasn't about to go down without a fight. Long Beach is a place where a new war is waged with each passing day, and when the hardened students who walk those dangerous hallways sense an outsider attempting to understand their plight, their cynical resentment threatens to keep a deadly cycle in motion. Despite the initially hostile reaction she receives in the classroom, Gruwell uses the writings of Anne Frank and Zlata's Diary: A Child's Life in Sarajevo to teach her students not only the basis of the English language, but compassion and tolerance as well. Later, when the time comes to tell their own tales in a project specially designed to explore the daily violence that the majority of students have grown numb to, the barriers that had once stood so strong gradually begin to crumble. When the only chance for survival is to befriend the person who was once your mortal enemy, the world is opened to a whole new realm of possibilities.","The main events depicted take place between 1994‚Äö√Ñ√¨1996, beginning with scenes from the 1992 Los Angeles riots. Erin Gruwell (Hilary Swank), a new, excited school teacher who leaves the safety of her hometown, Newport Beach, to teach at Woodrow Wilson High School in Long Beach, a formerly high achieving school which has recently put an integration plan in place. Her enthusiasm is rapidly challenged when she realizes that her class are all ""at-risk"" high school students, also known as ""unteachables"", and not the eager-for-college students she was expecting. The high school students self-segregate into racial groups in the classroom, gang fights break out, and eventually most of the high school students stop attending class. Not only does Gruwell meet opposition from her high school students, but she also has a difficult time with her department head, who refuses to let her teach her high school students with books in case they get damaged and lost, and instead tells her to focus on training them discipline and obedience.
One night, two high school students, Eva (April Lee Hern‚àö¬∞ndez), a Mexican-American girl and narrator for much of the film, and a Cambodian refugee, Sindy (Jaclyn Ngan), frequent the same convenience store. An additional student, Grant Rice (Armand Jones) is frustrated at losing an arcade game and demands a refund from the store owner. When he storms out, Eva's boyfriend Paco attempts a drive-by shooting, intending to kill Grant but misses, accidentally killing Sindy's boyfriend. As a witness, Eva must testify at court; she intends to guard ""her own"" in her testimony.
At school, Gruwell intercepts a racist drawing by one of her high school students and utilizes it to teach them about the Holocaust. She gradually begins to earn their trust and buys them composition books to record their diaries, in which they talk about their experiences of being abused, seeing their friends die, and being evicted. Determined to reform her high school students, Gruwell takes on two part-time jobs to pay for more books and spends a lot more time at school, much to the disappointment of her husband (Patrick Dempsey). Her students start to behave with respect and discover a lot more. A transformation is specifically visible in one student, Marcus (Jason Finn). Gruwell invites various Jewish Holocaust survivors to talk with her class about their experiences and requires the students to attend a field trip to the Museum of Tolerance. Meanwhile, her unorthodox training methods are scorned by her colleagues and department chair Margaret Campbell (Imelda Staunton).
The following year comes, and Gruwell teaches her class again, making it the second year of her being their teacher. On the first day of sophomore year, Gruwell makes her class do a ""Toast for Change"", allowing everyone to open up about their struggles and how they would attempt to change each. (This title - ""Toast for Change"", reoccurs for the themes of their fundraisers). In class, when reading The Diary of Anne Frank, they invite Miep Gies (Pat Carroll), the woman who sheltered Anne Frank from the German soldiers to talk to them. After they raise the money to bring her over, Miep shares her experiences hiding Anne Frank. When Marcus tells her that she is his hero, she denies it, claiming she was merely doing the right thing. Her denial leads Eva to rethink her plan to lie during her testimony. When she testifies, she finally breaks down and tells the truth, much to some of her family members' dismay and to her own risk. She gets attacked by members of her gang and ends up going to live with her aunt in order to keep herself safe.
Meanwhile, Gruwell asks her students to write their diaries in book form. She compiles the entries and names it The Freedom Writers Diary. Her husband divorces her and Margaret tells her she cannot teach her kids for their junior year. Gruwell fights this decision, eventually convincing the superintendent to permit her to teach her kids' junior and senior year. The film ends with a note that Gruwell successfully prepared numerous high school students to graduate high school and attend college, for many the first in their families to do so.","sentimental,rough,sincere,touching",3877.jpg,2007-01-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/freedom-writers/id267966811?uo=4,MT0L1U-Rdj4,70053462,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Freedom_Writers/70053462,Drama

2958,Friday Night Lights,"Odessa, Texas, is a small, town in Texas. Racially divided and economically dying, there is one night that gives the town something to live for: Friday Night. The Permian Panthers have a big winning tradition in Texas high school football, led by QB Mike Winchell and superstar tailback Boobie Miles, but all is not well, as Boobie suffers a career-ending injury in the first game of the season. Hope is lost among citizens in Odessa, and for the team, but Coach Gary Gaines, who believes that ""Perfection is being able to look your friends in the eye and know you did everything you could not to let them down"", is somehow able to help the team rise up from the ashes and make a huge season comeback. Now on their way to state, the Panthers must go out and be perfect, because they may never matter this much for the rest of their lives. A genuine stand-up-and-cheer movie about a courageous high school football team's fight to fulfill their destiny and live their dream, Friday Night Lights is ""unforgettable and real!"" (Larry King) Billy Bob Thornton stars in a true American story of how one legendary Texas town made hope come alive under the exhilarating glare of Friday Night Lights! ""One of the greatest sports stories ever told"" (Sports Illustrated) is now ""one of the greatest sports movies ever made!"" (Larry King)","Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semifinals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ or alludes to ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.
The coach, Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), is constantly in the hot seat. Tied to the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player and running back James ""Boobie"" Miles (Derek Luke) who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Recuperating on his uncle's veranda he observes the refuse collectors doing their rounds and gets a glimpse of a somewhat different future he could now face; he bursts into tears. Quarterback Mike Winchell (Lucas Black) struggles with being able to play consistently. Fullback Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund) has a rocky relationship with his alcoholic and abusive father (Tim McGraw). Billingsley silently endures the abuse from his father, who won a state championship at Permian only to find himself unable to get into college and stuck working a dead-end job. Third-string running back Chris Comer (Lee Thompson Young), who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury. His obsession with fame and recognition also comes at a high price that he is at first not ready to pay. Safety Brian Chavez (Jay Hernandez) is easily the smartest player on the team, and the most confident in his future after high school football. One of the themes of the movie depicts the coach as a father-type figure for the players.
Coach Gaines triumphs and struggles with winning football games and connecting with his players a number of times during their tumultuous season. His job depends on the Panthers making the playoffs, and his team is in a three-way tie with two other teams at the end of the regular season. Under Texas rules for ties, the tiebreaker is a coin-toss. Permian gets a spot. Meanwhile, after he drunkenly throws away his championship ring, Don Billingsley's father breaks down and confesses his failures in life cause him to push his son as harshly as he does, pointing out that he wants his son to at least have one big moment of triumph before becoming like his dad. The team make it to the finals, where they narrowly lose against powerhouse Dallas Carter High School. The movie ends with the coach removing the departing seniors from the depth chart on his wall. Notably, the depth chart has ""Case"" at quarterback. This refers to Permian's real-life backup quarterback in 1988, Stoney Case, who would go on to lead Permian, along with Chris Comer, to the 5A state title the following year, and still later made it to the NFL. The final scene consists of Winchell throwing a football to a bunch of pee-wees playing pick-up football before leaving with Billingsley and Chavez.","heart pounding,highschool,larryking,sportsillustrated,sincere,cheer,pounding,trust,texas,nfl,sports,sport,factual,rough,usa,fan,captivating,field,football,suspenseful,american football,field.",2958.jpg,2004-10-08, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/friday-night-lights/id296586594?uo=4,Qzyp4qOW0F0,70002003,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Friday_Night_Lights/70002003,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

Written and directed by first-time director Ryan Coogler, Fruitvale is anchored by a strong performance from Chronicle's Michael B. Jordan as Oscar Grant, the 22-year-old who was tragically shot and killed by a San Francisco police officer on New Year's Day, 2009.

A recreation of the day leading up to the shooting, Coogler presents an emotional portrait of a flawed character, with strong support from the likes of Oscar-winner Octavia Spencer.

And while the film ultimately veers into heartstring-pulling melodrama, it's an undoubtedly powerful and accomplished debut. 

The true story of Oscar, a 22-year-old Bay Area resident, who crosses paths with friends, enemies, family, and strangers on the last day of 2008.

464,Full Metal Jacket,"A pragmatic U.S. Marine observes the dehumanizing effects the Vietnam War has on his fellow Marine recruits from their brutal boot camp training to the bloody street fighting set in 1968 in Hue, Vietnam.

A two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive.
","In 1967, during the Vietnam War, a group of new U.S. Marine Corps recruits arrives at Parris Island for basic training. After having their heads shaved, they meet their Senior Drill Instructor, Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). Hartman employs draconian tactics to turn the recruits into hardened Marines prepared for combat. Among the recruits are Privates ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine), ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard), and the overweight, bumbling Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), who earns the nickname ""Gomer Pyle"" after attracting Hartman's wrath.
Unresponsive to Hartman's discipline, Pyle is eventually paired with Joker. Pyle improves with Joker's help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyle's foot locker. Believing that the recruits have failed to improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: every mistake Pyle makes will earn punishment for the rest of the platoon, with Pyle being spared. In retaliation, the platoon hazes Pyle with a blanket party, restraining him to his bunk and beating him with bars of soap wrapped in towels. After this incident, Pyle becomes a model Marine. This impresses Hartman, but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as talking to his M14 rifle.
Following their graduation the recruits receive their Military Occupational Specialty assignments; Joker is assigned to Basic Military Journalism. During the platoon's final night on Parris Island, Joker discovers Pyle in the bathroom loading his rifle with ammunition. Joker attempts to calm Pyle, who executes drill commands and recites the Rifleman's Creed. The noise awakens the platoon and Hartman. Hartman confronts Pyle and orders him to surrender the rifle. Pyle kills Hartman, and then commits suicide.
In January 1968, Joker, now a Sergeant, is a war correspondent in Vietnam for Stars and Stripes with Private First Class Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), a combat photographer. Rafterman wants to go into combat, as Joker claims he has done. At the Marine base, Joker is mocked for his lack of the thousand-yard stare, indicating his lack of war experience. They are interrupted by the start of the Tet Offensive as the North Vietnamese Army attempts to overrun the base.
The following day, the journalism staff is briefed about enemy attacks throughout South Vietnam. Joker is sent to Phu Bai, accompanied by Rafterman. They meet the Lusthog Squad, where Cowboy is now a Sergeant. Joker accompanies the squad during the Battle of Hu¬∑‚à´√∏, where platoon commander ""Touchdown"" (Ed O'Ross) is killed by the enemy. After the area is declared secure by the Marines, a team of American news journalists and reporters enter Hu¬∑‚à´√∏ and interview various Marines about their experiences in Vietnam and their opinions about the war.
During patrol, Crazy Earl (Kieron Jecchinis), the squad leader, is killed by a booby trap, leaving Cowboy in command. The squad becomes lost and Cowboy orders Eightball (Dorian Harewood) to scout the area. A Viet Cong sniper wounds Eightball and the squad medic, Doc Jay (John Stafford), is wounded himself in an attempt to save him against orders. Cowboy learns that tank support is not available and orders the team to prepare for withdrawal. The squad's machine gunner, Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin) disobeys Cowboy and attempts to save his teammates. He discovers there is only one sniper, but Doc Jay and Eightball are killed when Doc attempts to indicate the sniper's location. While maneuvering towards the sniper, Cowboy is shot and killed.
Animal Mother assumes command of the squad and leads an attack on the sniper. Joker discovers the sniper, a teenage girl, and attempts to shoot her, but his rifle jams and alerts her to his presence. Rafterman shoots the sniper, mortally wounding her. As the squad converge, the sniper begs for death, prompting an argument about whether or not to kill her. Animal Mother decides to allow a mercy killing only if Joker performs it. After some hesitation, Joker shoots her. The Marines congratulate him on his kill as Joker stares into the distance, displaying the thousand-yard stare. The Marines march toward their camp, singing the Mickey Mouse March. Joker states that despite being ""in a world of shit,"" he is glad to be alive and no longer afraid.","sucks,witty,kill,vietnam,platoon,rough,gun,war,army,biting,bleak,apocalypse,shoot,disturbing,contemplative,tough,fear",464.jpg,1987-06-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/full-metal-jacket/id280930208?uo=4,9M3sJOmqxEo,528677,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Full_Metal_Jacket/528677,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

3287,Garden State,"Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) returns to his hometown for the funeral of his clinically depressed mother, a journey that reconnects him with some of his past friends. Because the trip coincides with his decision to stop taking his powerful antidepressants, he also begins to reconnect with himself. A chance meeting with Sam (Natalie Portman), a girl also suffering from various maladies, opens up the possibility of rekindling emotional attachments, confronting his psychologist father, and perhaps beginning a new life.","Andrew Largeman (Braff) wakes up from a dream‚Äö√Ñ√Æin which he apathetically sits on a crashing plane‚Äö√Ñ√Æto a telephone message from his father (Holm), telling Andrew that he needs to return home because his mother has died.
Andrew leaves Los Angeles and returns home to New Jersey to attend the funeral. He recognizes the grave-diggers as old friends Mark (Sarsgaard) and Dave (Alex Burns), who invite him to a party that night, where they meet up with Jesse (Armando Riesco), an old friend who has just earned a fortune after creating silent Velcro. After smoking marijuana, he takes ecstasy at the party but remains detached. At home, his father books Andrew a doctor's appointment for headaches he's been having.
The morning after the party, Andrew proceeds to the appointment. In the waiting room, he meets a girl named Sam (Portman), who is a pathological liar. She later explains that most times she does not know why she lies and will always admit to them afterward. In Andrew's meeting with his doctor (Ron Leibman), it is revealed that Andrew has been on lithium and other mood stabilizers, as well as antidepressants, for his entire adult life, but has recently stopped taking them. He also says that his father, who is his psychiatrist, put him on the medication. Andrew finds Sam outside the office and offers her a ride home. Sam invites him into her house, and he meets her mother, who inadvertently reveals that Sam is an epileptic. Andrew tells Sam of his mother's death, and Sam tearfully eulogizes her hamster. After returning home, Andrew's father confronts him and is insistent that they have a talk before Andrew leaves.
Later, Andrew and Jesse sit in the cemetery as Mark digs another grave. Andrew observes Mark stealing jewelry from the corpse he is burying. Andrew then returns to Sam's house, and the two spend the rest of the day together, joining his friends later at Jesse's mansion. Andrew tells her that when he was nine years old he pushed his mother in frustration, knocking her over a broken dishwasher in an accident that left her paraplegic; he says that his father blames him for his wife's paralysis and put him on his medications to ""curb the anger"" he supposedly harbors. Sam listens, and Andrew then admits his feelings for her.
The next day, Mark tells Andrew that he needs help ""tracking down"" a going-away present for him. Sam, Andrew, and Mark spend the day together, ending it in a quarry in Newark where Mark talks to a man named Albert (Denis O'Hare), who is employed in keeping intruders out of the quarry. The three visitors discuss the reasons for which Albert and his wife choose to live in the quarry. Albert explains that living there and exploring the quarry is ""doing something that's completely unique, that's never been done before,"" mirroring an earlier speech by Sam. Finally, Albert explains that what actually matters is living with his family. Andrew is inspired by the conversation, and outside in the rain, he climbs atop a derelict crane and screams into the quarry, joined by Sam and Mark. He and Sam then share a kiss.
When Mark and Andrew look at the gift later on, it turns out to be Andrew's mother's favorite pendant, one of the items Mark stole from her grave, sold, and subsequently located. Andrew eventually talks with his father, and states that he was not to blame for his mother's accident and that he will live the rest of his life without medications. He forgives his father and says he wants to build a better relationship with him.
The morning after, Andrew says his goodbyes to Sam at the airport, while she begs him not to leave. He acknowledges that she has changed his life but that he still has to fix his personal problems before continuing the relationship. Andrew boards the flight, and Sam is left crying in a telephone booth. Andrew then returns, saying that he doesn't want to waste any more of his life without Sam. He wonders what to do next, and the two then kiss.","sentimental,sadness,joy,touching,humorous,clever,bittersweet,offbeat",3287.jpg,2004-01-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/garden-state/id270109340?uo=4,u82n0e1mgmQ,60034787,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Garden_State/60034787,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"

Stars: Gillian Jacobs, John Malkovich, Ryan Simpkins","At the age of eight, a young girl named Leslie (Ryan Simpkins) is kidnapped by Alex (Tom Arnold) and Frank (Kevin Zegers). Alex tricks her into helping him find his dog Trixie, then takes her to school; during the ride, he pretends that her father is his boss, thus earning her trust. After school, Alex and Frank find her again; they lure her into their car with a story about her dad being in trouble. Then they drug her and take her to their house. Alex tells her that her parents do not want her anymore. As proof, he provides a phone number to her ""father's cell phone"" which is in reality a pay phone. After several unanswered calls, she eventually accepts his story.
She and another victim, a young boy named Donny (Jermaine 'Scooter' Smith) are forced into prostitution and child pornography. Alex is very protective and fatherly to them, which adds to her confusion. Their clientele include men in positions of authority, such as a court judge, and they are told that they are lucky to be with such good and honorable men. As a coping mechanism, Donny and Leslie pretend they are in an imaginary world based on the stories of Mowgli and the Jungle Book. One day, Leslie goes to a convenience store, where it becomes apparent that her parents are looking for her, because her picture is on milk cartons.

Leslie is prostituting herself, and as a way to move away from this, she tries to lure a young teen living in a shelter into a prostitution ring. Donny has fallen in love with her, but Leslie is very confused because while she loves and cares for him, he has always acted as a brother and companion to her, and never as a lover. She goes to the shelter in an attempt to win the girl's trust and turn her out as a prostitute, but at the last minute she has a change of heart and returns the girl to the shelter. The counselor (John Malkovich) discovers her true identity and tells her that her parents have been looking for her all these years, which she finally realizes is true.

706,Get Smart,"In the world of covert intelligence, only one man is Smart. Steve Carell is in CONTROL as Maxwell Smart, the novice agent often out of his depths but never out of options in this action comedy pitting him against the nuclear scheme of the evil spy group KAOS. Anne Hathaway partners with Max as ever-capable Agent 99. And director Peter Segal (The Longest Yard) guides his stars (including Dwayne Johnson and Alan Arkin) in an alternately daffy and dangerous realm of molar radios, Max's amazing multi-function pocketknife and more gizmos from lab nerds Bruce (Masi Oka) and Lloyd (Nate Torrence). Laughs, excitement, exploding dental floss -- Get Smart is armed and hilarious.","Maxwell ""Max"" Smart, an analyst for the top secret American intelligence agency, CONTROL, yearns to become a field agent like his idol, Agent 23. Despite his amazing scores in the acceptance tests, Max is denied the promotion because the Chief of CONTROL feels that Max's analytic skills are best used for his present assignment. When CONTROL headquarters is attacked by the terrorist organization KAOS, led by Siegfried, almost all of CONTROL's agents' identities are exposed, leaving only Max and Agent 99, to pursue the culprits while former field operatives are demoted to desk jobs. Max is promoted to field agent as Agent 86, but the experienced 99 is reluctant to partner him because of his clumsy personality.
Max and 99 enter Russia by parachute, hoping to trace KAOS' recent acquisition of nuclear materials through its chief bomb maker, Krstic. Along the way, they are attacked by Dalip, one of Siegfried's henchmen. By infiltrating a luxurious party hosted by Krstic, they trace the nuclear material to a KAOS nuclear weapons factory disguised as a Moscow bakery, but when Krstic and his men corner them, Max is forced to shoot him. In the bakery, Max meets with Siegfried and his second-in-command, Shtarker, only to learn that Siegfried was expecting him because a double-agent has compromised his and 99's identities. Max manages to escape capture and destroy the weapons factory, but during their escape, Max and 99 are confronted by Dalip. Realizing that he knows Dalip through hours of listening to him on spy 'chatter', Max manages to persuade Dalip to spare their lives. The Chief sends 23 to observe the clean-up of the factory, but KAOS manages to sneak the weapons out through the Moskva River, with 23 reporting that only a bakery has been destroyed. Realizing that Max was alone during his key discoveries, CONTROL believes Max to be the double-agent. 99, who has been gradually falling in love with Max, is heartbroken but takes Max into custody.
CONTROL's warning is disregarded when Siegfried threatens to release nuclear weapon detonator codes to rogue states unless the United States government pays him $200 billion. KAOS plans to plant a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. While Max is in a CONTROL holding cell, Dalip sends him a coded message via the radio show American Top 40 revealing Siegfried's plan. Max escapes from CONTROL and flies to Los Angeles to unite with the Chief, 99, and 23, who have flown out to persuade the President to take the KAOS threat seriously. Max manages to convince 99 and the Chief that he is not the double-agent. As KAOS plants the nuclear bomb in the Walt Disney Concert Hall, where the president will be attending a concert, the group figures out that 23 is the real double-agent after Max's Geiger counter-equipped watch beeps when he is near 23, picking up trace elements of radiation. 23 then pulls out a gun, takes 99 hostage and flees in a vehicle. Max and the Chief pursue 23 with a car before crashing into a golf course. The car hits a shack, sending it flying through the air, and landing on the fence of an airport which allows Max and the Chief to hop onto a small plane. Max reaches 23's car by jumping out of the plane and rescues 99, but in the struggle, the car is set on fire and forced onto railroad tracks. Max then kisses 23 to distract him. The car collides with a freight train, killing 23. After analyzing 23's nuclear football, Max realizes that the bomb will be triggered by the final note of Beethoven's ""Ode to Joy"". They rush to the Disney Hall, with Max tackling the conductor just before the final note, saving the president and Los Angeles. Siegfried, finding that his plan has failed, informs Dalip that he will not kill his wife for his failure. In response, Dalip throws Siegfried into a river. Max is afterwards given honors and gets his dream of becoming a real spy with agent 99 as his girlfriend. The movie ends as Max and 99 exit CONTROL headquarters through the walkway.","joy,gadget,spy,humorous,gedgets,kaos,agent,gizmo,secretagent,exciting,nerd,gadgets,secret",706.jpg,2008-06-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/get-smart/id286030181?uo=4,guUYvXf_KvA,70077557,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Get_Smart/70077557,"Action & Adventure,Comedy"

1158,Ghost Town,"In the comedy ""Ghost Town,"" Bertram Pincus (Ricky Gervais) is a man whose people skills leave much to be desired. When Pincus dies unexpectedly and but is miraculously revived after seven minutes, he wakes up to discover that he now has the annoying ability to see ghosts. Even worse, they all want something from him, particularly Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear), who pesters him into breaking up the impending marriage of his widow Gwen (T‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬©a Leoni). That puts Pincus squarely in the middle of a triangle, with spirited results.","The film begins as married New York City businessman Frank Herlihy (Greg Kinnear) is accidentally killed while trying to buy an apartment for his mistress. Shortly afterward, misanthropic dentist Bertram Pincus (Ricky Gervais) has a near-death experience while under general anesthetic during a colonoscopy. When he recovers, he is able to see and communicate with ghosts who populate the area. The ghosts annoy Bertram by asking him to help them with personal business that was left unfinished when they died. Frank promises to keep the other ghosts away if Bertram will break up an engagement between Frank's widow Gwen (Leoni), a professional Egyptologist, and Richard (Billy Campbell), a human-rights lawyer who Frank says is dishonest. Bertram eventually agrees to the deal and tries to woo Gwen away from Richard. Bertram's past rudeness to Gwen makes this difficult, but he attracts her interest by analyzing the teeth of a mummified Egyptian Pharaoh that she has been studying.
When Bertram has dinner with Gwen and Richard, he decides that Richard is not as bad as Frank claimed, but Bertram himself begins to fall in love with Gwen, and she enjoys Bertram's sense of humor. At another dinner, Gwen reveals that she learned of Frank's mistress the day he died, and when Richard visits Bertram for some dental work, Bertram drugs him with laughing gas in order to make him reveal that Gwen has broken their engagement. Frank doesn't understand why he is still on earth if his ""unfinished business"" was to break up Richard and Gwen.
Gwen, not being engaged to Richard any longer, says yes to a proposal that would send her to the Valley of the Kings in Egypt for six months. As a going-away present, Bertram gets her a new key chain from a fancy jeweler's, as she had earlier mentioned that she desperately needed one. But when he mistakenly reveals information about Gwen that only Frank could have known, she demands the truth, and Bertram tells her the whole story about the ghosts. Gwen doesn't believe him and demands to know what Frank's worst nightmare was. Frank lies to Bertram, telling him a fake nightmare, and Gwen, thinking that Bertram has been lying to her and playing some kind of game, walks away and stops talking to him. Bertram demands to know why Frank lied to him about the nightmare, and Frank says, ""Because you're a heartless son-of-a-bitch who doesn't give a rat's ass about anyone but himself. [Gwen's] already had one of those."" (Meaning himself.)
Bertram sinks into a depression and asks a fellow dentist (Aasif Mandvi), for medication that will help him forget Gwen. His colleague instead convinces him that his life would be better if he decided to stop being selfish and start helping people. Bertram begins helping the ghosts around him with their ""unfinished business"" on earth, bringing comfort to people they left behind and enabling the ghosts to depart. As he does this he realizes that the ghosts were still on earth not because they had unfinished business, but because the people they were close to were not finished with them. He also learns to appreciate people.
Bertram realizes that the reason Frank cannot leave is that Gwen has not let go of him yet. He confronts Gwen who asks him to ask Frank why she wasn't enough for him, and Frank says he's sorry for hurting her, which Bertram tells Gwen. Gwen is incredulous that after his infidelity, all Frank would have to say was 'sorry' and thinks that Bertram is making it all up. He rushes after her and while trying to persuade her to believe him, gets hit by a bus. Bertram, now a ghost himself, watches with Frank as people crowd around his body and Gwen cries over him. Richard arrives on his way to the reception and tries to revive Bertram with prayer and CPR. Seeing how distraught Gwen is, Frank gives Bertram 'some advice' that will be useful in case he is resuscitated, and tells him that Gwen's tears are for Bertram, in others words she loves him. After saying this, Frank is finally allowed to leave the earthly plane.
Bertram wakes up alive in the hospital. Later Gwen, who needs dental work, comes in for an appointment with another dentist but finds Bertram's office to say hello. Bertram tells Gwen Frank's real nightmare (losing his way home), which was the advice Frank told him, and then assures her that Frank has 'found his way home.'

810,Ghostbusters,"A trio of university parasychologists lose their research grant and decide to open their own business, ""Ghostbusters,"" and almost at once are summoned to investigate the strange happenings in a Central Park West apartment. What they discover is that all Manhattan is being besieged by other worldly demons.","Following their first encounter with a ghost, misfit parapsychologists Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) lose their jobs at Columbia University. Unable to research their discovery, the trio establish a paranormal exterminator service known as ""Ghostbusters"" in a retired firehouse. Lacking customers and faced with dwindling funds, they are eventually hired by the Sedgewick Hotel to investigate a haunting. At the hotel, they capture their first ghost and deposit it in a ""containment unit"" located in the firehouse basement. Paranormal activity begins to increase in New York City, and the Ghostbusters become celebrities containing it, while at the same time becoming increasingly burdened by the hectic schedule. The group later hire a fourth member, Winston Zeddemore (Ernie Hudson), to help them cope with the demands.
The Ghostbusters are hired by Dana Barrett (Sigourney Weaver), whose apartment is haunted by a demonic spirit called Zuul, a demigod worshipped as a servant to Gozer the Gozerian, a Sumerian shape-shifting god of destruction. Venkman takes a particular interest in the case, competing for Dana's affection with her neighbor, Louis Tully (Rick Moranis). As they investigate, Dana is possessed by Zuul, which declares itself ""The Gatekeeper"", and Louis by a similar demon called Vinz Clortho, ""The Keymaster."" Both demons speak of the coming of the destructive Gozer, and the Ghostbusters plan to keep the two apart. Thereafter, the Ghostbusters' office is visited by Walter Peck (William Atherton), a lawyer representing the EPA, who has the team arrested for operating an unlicensed nuclear device in their basement and orders their ghost containment grid deactivated, unleashing hundreds of captured ghosts onto the city. Freed from the Ghostbusters' custody, Louis/Vinz advances toward Dana/Zuul's apartment while the escaped ghosts create havoc throughout the city.
Consulting blueprints of Dana's apartment, the Ghostbusters learn that it was built by mad doctor and cult leader Ivo Shandor, who designed the building as a gateway to summon Gozer and bring about the end of the world, claiming humanity was too sick to survive after the horrors of World War I. The Ghostbusters are brought to the mayor's office and freed in order to combat the paranormal activity, but are unable to prevent the arrival of Gozer, who initially appears as a woman (Slavitza Jovan). Briefly subdued by the team, Gozer disappears, but her voice echoes that the ""destructor"" will follow, taking a form chosen by the team. Venkman, holding that this means that whatever they imagine will appear as a destroying force, urges his comrades to avoid giving form to the destructor by clearing their minds. Unable to keep his mind blank, Stantz remembers a beloved corporate mascot from childhood, ""something that could never, ever possibly destroy us,"" whereupon the destructor arrives in Stantz's chosen form of the giant Stay Puft Marshmallow Man and begins laying waste to the city. To defeat this manifestation, the team decides to merge the energy streams of their proton packs (against which Egon advised earlier) and direct them at Gozer's portal to their world. The plan succeeds, banishing Gozer back to whence it came, sealing the gateway between the worlds, and destroying the Marshmallow Man in a single explosion. Soon thereafter, Dana and Louis are freed from the ashen remains of their possessors. As hundreds of New Yorkers wipe the melted marshmallow goo from their brows, the Ghostbusters are applauded by the city's population.","whatif,why you gonna call,whoyagonnacall,joy,trust,witty,manhattan,humorous,ghost,new york,demon,believe,mvp,parasychologists,lean,supernatural,agile,parasychology,hypothesis,anticipation,leanstartup,leanux,offbeat,fear",810.jpg,1984-06-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/ghostbusters/id276558682?uo=4,9u4FHmId-Y0,541018,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Ghostbusters/541018,"Action & Adventure,Comedy,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

7152,Ginger & Rosa,"London, 1962. Two teenage girls - Ginger (Elle Fanning) and Rosa (Alice Englert) - are inseparable. They play truant together, discuss religion, politics and hairstyles, and dream of lives bigger than their mothers' frustrated domesticity. But, as the Cold War meets the sexual revolution, and the threat of nuclear holocaust escalates, the lifelong friendship of the two girls is shattered - by the clash of desire and the determination to survive.","'Can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t you be a girl for a moment or two longer?‚Äö√Ñ√¥ That‚Äö√Ñ√¥s kindly, avuncular Mark (Timothy Spall) talking to his deadly-serious teenage goddaughter, Ginger (Elle Fanning), in Sally Potter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s intimate, intense coming-of-age drama. It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s set during the Cuban Missile crisis ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ as the world teeters on the edge of nuclear war. Ginger is on the brink too, and Fanning‚Äö√Ñ√¥s genuinely breathtaking performance, bare and brave (she was 13 at the time) beautifully captures innocence at the moment of its passing ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ that shiver of teen expectation. What a shame then, that ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Ginger & Rosa‚Äö√Ñ√¥ is dampened by some ponderous, self-conscious scenes.

It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s 1962, the year the Stones played their first gig, but London is not quite swinging yet. Ginger is marching to ban the bomb. Her best friend, Rosa (Alice Englert), is busy snogging boys and cultivating an air of cool. Director Sally Potter strings together a series of brilliantly observed moments between the two girls. They sit in a bath of cold water shrinking their blue jeans and combing through comics for advice about boys. ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Girls should have a bubbly personality,‚Äö√Ñ√¥ reads Rosa. ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Do you think Simone de Beauvoir has a bubbly personality?‚Äö√Ñ√¥ asks Ginger.

Potter isn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t one of British film‚Äö√Ñ√¥s household names. She‚Äö√Ñ√¥s best-known for her film of Virginia Woolf‚Äö√Ñ√¥s novel ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Orlando‚Äö√Ñ√¥ with Tilda Swinton. But she‚Äö√Ñ√¥s always been able to pull in a starry A-list cast. Christina Hendricks (‚Äö√Ñ√≤Mad Men‚Äö√Ñ√¥) plays Ginger‚Äö√Ñ√¥s mum, and Annette Bening is a radical feminist. But ‚Äö√Ñ√≤Ginger & Rosa‚Äö√Ñ√¥ belongs to its teen leads ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ their performances are more astonishing since neither is British (Fanning is American and Englert is Australian).

Problems between the two girls arise when Rosa sets her sights on Ginger‚Äö√Ñ√¥s writer dad, Roland ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a complex performance from Alessandro Nivola. Roland lives by his own rules, ostentatiously ignoring convention. From a certain angle, in a particular light, he looks like a man who lives by his principles ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ imprisoned as a conscientious objector during World War II. But that same free-thinking principle also makes it okay to cheat on his wife with an underage girl.",,7152.jpg,2012-10-19,,GekB_GI8Sis,70257413,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Ginger_Rosa/70257413,Drama
3164,Gladiator,"A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key advisor to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. Gladiator also features Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, and Oliver Reed, who died of a heart attack midway through production.","In AD 180, General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) leads the Roman army to a decisive victory against Germanic tribes at Vindobona, ending a long war on the Roman frontier and earning the esteem of the elderly Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Though he had a male heir, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the dying emperor wishes to grant temporary leadership to Maximus, hoping eventually to return power to the Roman Senate. When his father tells him of the decision, Commodus, already bitter that Marcus favors Maximus over him, murders his father in a fit of rage and claims the throne.
Maximus realizes the truth about Marcus' death, but is betrayed by his friend, General Quintus (Tomas Arana), who reluctantly instructs the Praetorian guards to carry out Commodus' order to execute Maximus, his wife (Giannina Facio), and son (Giorgio Cantarini). Maximus manages to escape but is unable to return in time to save his family. After burying them, Maximus is found unconscious by slave traders and taken to Zucchabar, a Roman city in North Africa. There, he is bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed) and forced to fight for his life as a gladiator in arena tournaments. During this time, he befriends fellow gladiators Juba (Djimon Hounsou) and Hagen (Ralf M‚àö‚àÇller). Juba tells Maximus to have faith that he will be reunited with his family in the afterlife.
Maximus proves a fierce gladiator; with nothing left to live for, he is fearless in the arena. He ultimately reaches the prestigious Roman Colosseum, where his group is contracted to fight in a tribute to the Battle of Zama. Concealing his identity with a helmet, he skillfully leads a band of gladiators to defeat an opposing chariot and archer force, earning the crowd's praise. Forced to reveal himself to a stunned Commodus in the arena afterward, the crowd votes to spare his life, and Commodus, obsessed with the people's approval, appeases them by doing so. Maximus later wins against the undefeated gladiator Tigris, as well as tigers released into the arena, yet refuses to obey Commodus' command to perform the coup de gr‚àö¬¢ce. As a result, he is declared ""Maximus the Merciful"" by the crowd, increasing his popularity and further frustrating Commodus, who cannot kill Maximus without losing favor with the Roman people.
Following the fight, Maximus is told by his former servant Cicero (Tommy Flanagan) that his army is still loyal to him. Maximus then conspires with Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and the senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) to rejoin with his army and topple Commodus by force. Commodus, however, suspects his sister of betrayal and forces her to reveal the plot by using veiled threats against her young son Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark). During Maximus' attempted escape, Commodus' guards attack Proximo's gladiator school, killing Hagen and Proximo. Juba and the survivors are imprisoned, but Maximus makes it to the city walls, where he is captured after a failed attempt to save Cicero.
Desperate to get Maximus out of the way and prove his own greatness, Commodus arranges a duel with him in the arena. Unknown to the crowd, Commodus stabs a restrained Maximus with a stiletto to gain advantage over him before they enter the arena. During the fight, Maximus manages to disarm Commodus, while Quintus disobeys the emperor's demand for his sword and commands his soldiers to do the same. Commodus then produces the hidden stiletto, but Maximus plunges the blade into Commodus' throat, killing him.
With his dying words, Maximus carries out Marcus Aurelius' wishes, calling for Gracchus to be reinstated, the slaves to be freed, and power to be restored to the Senate. As he dies, Maximus reunites with his family in the afterlife. Lucilla then reiterates his wishes and honors his memory. Some time later, Juba buries Maximus' two small figurines of his wife and son in the ground where his friend Maximus died, promising to see him in the afterlife, ""but not yet"".","emperor,empire,eternity,stylized,comitted,believe,captivating,lead by example,colosseum,commit,family,driven,leader,set an example,loyalty,focus,anticipation,defiance,honour,brutal,games,hero,commitment,vision,honor,leadership,faith,trust,team,destiny,game,rough,goal,lean,maximus,exciting,soldier,soldiers,plan,suspenseful,strong,rome,emotional,defy,roman,fear",3164.jpg,2000-05-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/gladiator/id397380075?uo=4,"ol67qo3WhJk,GQRzYGEV0jQ",60000929,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Gladiator/60000929,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Drama"

Charged with finding the most exciting videos in international and independent film, Focus World is proud to bring you Gnarr, the hilarious true story of the comedian who ran for the mayor of Iceland's largest city. With Iceland falling on hard times, Jon Gnarr decided to invent a new political party - the subtly named ""Best Party"" - and run for office in order to mock the squabbling left and right. With a campaign that included mandatory viewings of HBO's ""The Wire"" for all politicians, free towels at public pools, and a ""drug-free parliament by 2020,"" Gnarr soon found himself with unexpected political momentum, and realized that against all odds - he just might win.","Jon Gnarr is an iconoclastic Icelandic comedian who has won a large audience at home for his offbeat comic style, and in 2009, after the global economic crisis hit Iceland hard, he decided to run for mayor of Reykjavik, largely as a prank. Gnarr launched his own political party, The Best Party (their slogan: ""Hooray for all kinds of things!""), and created a purposefully absurd political platform in which, among other things, he promised to build a Disney theme park in Iceland, eliminate all elected official who don't faithfully watch The Wire, and increase the number of polar bears in the city's zoos. Gnarr's campaign won him a lot of laughs, but surprisingly also gained popular support -- early polls had him claiming 13% of the vote, and as election day drew nearer, his campaign team of punk rockers, bohemians and folks sick of the status quo were in the position of being legitimate spoilers in the mayoral race, with the other candidates as a loss for how to run against him. Filmmaker Gaukur Ulfarsson uses newsreel footage and material shot by fans and supporters to chronicle Jon Gnarr's introduction to Icelandic politics in the documentary Gnarr.

2397,God of Love,"Oscar's Winner for Best Live-Action Short Film 2010. Lounge-singing darts champion Raymond Goodfellow finds his prayers are answered -- literally -- when he receives a mysterious package of passion-inducing darts. The catch is that the one woman he loves -- Kelly, a drummer in his band -- is already in love with Ray's best friend Fozzie, the guitarist in the band. But when Ray uses the darts in a loony scheme to resolve this strange romantic triangle, he learns a surprising lesson about unrequited love and discovers his own place in the universe. Romance is in the air in this bohemian charmer.","Raymand Goodfellow rides on a country road on his motor scooter. His voice over explains ‚Äö√Ñ√∫You can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t control who you fall in love with, or who falls in love with you. Love doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t make sense.‚Äö√Ñ√π
The film flashes back to three months earlier to Ray‚Äö√Ñ√¥s time as a confident, self-centered lounge singer/dart thrower. Ray‚Äö√Ñ√¥s band consists of his friends Fozzie (guitar), Frank (stand-up bass) and the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫love of his life‚Äö√Ñ√π Kelly (drums). Before he joins the band onstage, Ray prays to God asking him for assistance in getting Kelly to love him. Despite Ray‚Äö√Ñ√¥s ongoing affection to her, she seems drawn to Fozzie who, claiming he's genuinely uninterested, is rejecting Kelly‚Äö√Ñ√¥s advances.
After Ray‚Äö√Ñ√¥s crowd pleasing performance, he is informed by the bartender that someone has left a package for him. The package contains ‚Äö√Ñ√∫love darts.‚Äö√Ñ√π The instructions for the darts explain that when someone is poked with love dart they are immediately attracted to the first person they see. This attraction lasts for 6 hours. At the end of the 6 hours if the love is meant to last it will, but if the love wasn't meant to be, it won‚Äö√Ñ√¥t.
Ray tells Fozzie about the darts and they both agree to have a test run. While the band walks home from a gig, Ray throws a love dart catching a prissy Jersey Girl named Angela. The first man she sees is Ray‚Äö√Ñ√¥s quiet, low-key bandmate Frank. Just as the instructions promised, Angela falls in love with Frank immediately. Ray and Fozzie follow the new couple around. After exactly six hours, Angela appears to still be in love with Frank and Ray declares the darts ‚Äö√Ñ√∫effective.‚Äö√Ñ√π
Ray enlists Fozzie‚Äö√Ñ√¥s help in creating the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫most romantic six hours‚Äö√Ñ√π ensuring that Kelly will remain in love with Ray after the love dart‚Äö√Ñ√¥s initial power ends. Fozzie is able to offer several tips, knowing a surprising amount about Kelly and the things that are important to her.
Ray goes to Kelly‚Äö√Ñ√¥s house and strikes her with a dart. As promised by the dart‚Äö√Ñ√¥s instructions, she immediately falls in love with him. They go on their date which goes perfectly. Towards the end of the six hours they kiss. When the six hours end, Kelly looks uncomfortable, thanks him for the evening, and leaves. It is clear that the love from the dart did not last.
Ray consoles himself by poking one woman after another until he has a whole flock of women (and one man) who are completely in love with him for six hours. During this time all he can do is talk about getting Kelly to fall in love with him again. He even contemplates convincing her that she has diabetes so she has to poke herself with the love darts over and over again.
The love darts wear off and he is alone again, ready to try his last dart on Kelly one more time. Walking home from another gig with his band, Ray prepares for his final throw at Kelly. Moments before throwing the dart he realizes that his loyal friend Fozzie is really in love with her and that she is really in love with him. Instead of striking Kelly with the dart, he hits Fozzie right as he looks up at Kelly. The two instantly fall in love with each other.
A wiser and less self-centered Ray returns to his apartment. He finds another mysterious box outside his apartment with a note that says ‚Äö√Ñ√∫nice work.‚Äö√Ñ√π He opens the box and finds Cupid‚Äö√Ñ√¥s bow and arrow.
The film flashes forward to three months in the future at the point the film began. The band continues but without Ray; Angela is the new singer. Frank & Angela and Fozzie & Kelly are still very much in love. Ray is many miles away driving on his motor scooter on the country road his bow and arrow tied to his back. He repeats ‚Äö√Ñ√∫you can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t control who you love, or who loves you.‚Äö√Ñ√π He ends by saying that love doesn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t make sense. He knows all this because ‚Äö√Ñ√∫I am the God of Love.‚Äö√Ñ√π",,2397.jpg, ,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/god-of-love/id421335326?uo=4 ,,,,"Comedy,Drama,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
1655,Gods and Generals,"The rise and fall of legendary war hero Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson as he leads the Confederacy to great success against the Union from 1861 to 1863. Prequel to the 1993 classic ""Gettysburg"".","The film centers mostly on the personal and professional life of Thomas ""Stonewall"" Jackson, the God-fearing and militarily brilliant yet acutely eccentric Confederate general, from the outbreak of the American Civil War until its halfway point when Jackson, while on a night ride with his staff to investigate the grounds of battle, is accidentally shot by his own soldiers in May 1863 while commanding at the Battle of Chancellorsville. It also follows Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, a Maine college professor who is appointed a Lieutenant Colonel and becomes second-in-command of the 20th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The film prominently features the Battles of 1st Bull Run (1st Manassas), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. The film's original running time clocked in at nearly 6 hours (much like the original running time of Gettysburg). The longer version featured the Battle of Antietam (Sharpsburg) as well as an entire plot following the American actor and future presidential assassin John Wilkes Booth and his colleague Henry Harrison (from Gettysburg).
The film opens with Robert E. Lee's resignation from the Union Army, accompanied by the perspectives of various politicians, teachers, and soldiers as the south secedes from the Union and both sides prepare for war. Jackson, who is a professor at Virginia Military Institute in Lexington at the outset of the war, leaves his family behind to do battle at the First Battle of Manassas. Jackson is asked by a retreating General Bernard Bee for assistance against the Federal army who is pursuing them after a brief stand on Matthews Hill. In rallying his shaken troops, Bee launches the name of Stonewall into history and the Confederates win the day at Henry Hill, Manassas, Virginia. Jackson maintains steadfast discipline in his ranks during the battle despite suffering a wound to his left hand from a spent ball.
Meanwhile, Chamberlain makes his transition from teacher to military officer and practices drilling his soldiers. He is called to battle at the Union invasion of Fredericksburg. The southern forces lead a fighting retreat as the Union army crosses the river and storms the town, and there are scenes of the subsequent looting of Fredricksburg by the Union Army. Outside the city, Lee, Longstreet and Jackson have prepared an elaborate defense on the heights outside the town, and the movie focuses on Confederate defenses behind a formidable stone wall. Several Union brigades attempt to cross an open field and attack the wall, but are thrown back with heavy losses. At one point, two Irish units are forced into battle against one another, to the anguish of a southern soldier who believes he is killing his kin. Chamberlain leads an unsuccessful attack against Jackson's defenses and finds his unit pinned down in the open field. He survives by shielding himself with a corpse until nightfall; eventually he and the surviving members of his unit are ordered to retreat. Chamberlain and the defeated Union soldiers depart Fredericksburg. Jackson and Lee return to the city, and Lee is confronted by an angry citizen whose house has been destroyed by the Union forces.
Jackson spends the winter at a local plantation, where he contracts a friendship with a little girl who lives there. Later, Jackson discovers the child has died from scarlet fever and he begins to cry. A soldier asks why he weeps for this child but not for the thousands of dead soldiers, and another soldier states that Jackson is weeping for everyone. Jackson is soon reunited with his wife and newborn child just before the battle of Chancellorsville.
Outside Chancellorsville, Lee identifies that the southern army faces an opposing force almost twice their size. Jackson calls upon his chaplain, who knows the area, and asks him to find a route by which the southern forces can infiltrate in secret. Jackson then leads his forces in a surprise attack on an unprepared Union camp. Although his men initially rout the opponents, they quickly become confused in the melee and Jackson's attack is stalled. While scouting a path at night, Jackson is caught in the no-mans-land between the two sides and badly wounded. During his evacuation, his litter bearers are targeted by artillery and drop Jackson on the ground. He is then taken to a field hospital where his arm is amputated. Lee remarks that while Jackson has lost his left hand, Lee has lost his right. Jackson dies of pneumonia a short while later, using his last words to extol his wife and fellow officers to ""Press on!"" The film concludes with a scene showing Jackson's body being returned to Lexington, Virginia, followed by text explaining that shortly thereafter, Lee decided to take the army and march on an invasion of the north, a journey which would conclude with the Battle of Gettysburg.",,1655.jpg,2003-02-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/gods-and-generals/id292045725?uo=4,,60025057,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Gods_and_Generals/60025057,"Classics,Drama"

As the case progresses, Kenzie and Gennaro face drug dealers, gangs and pedophiles. When they are about to solve their case, they are faced with a moral dilemma that could tear them apart.","Private investigator Patrick Kenzie and his partner/girlfriend Angie Gennaro witness a televised plea by a woman named Helene McCready for the return of her missing daughter Amanda, who was abducted with her favorite doll ""Mirabelle"". Patrick and Angie are then hired by the child's Aunt Beatrice to find Amanda and discover that Helene and her boyfriend ""Skinny Ray"" had recently stolen money from Cheese, a local Haitian drug lord. After Ray is murdered, Patrick and Angie join the police detectives investigating the case, Remy Bressant and Nick Poole, to arrange a trade of the money for Amanda. Captain Jack Doyle shows Patrick a telephone transcript of the drug lord setting up an exchange for Amanda. The exchange at a nearby quarry in Quincy is botched and Amanda is believed to have drowned, as her doll is found in the quarry and returned to Helene. Doyle, whose own daughter was killed years before, takes responsibility for the death and goes into early retirement.
Two months later, a seven-year-old boy is abducted in Everett and Patrick receives information that the boy was taken by a known child molester. After entering his house and finding evidence of the abducted boy, Patrick returns with Remy and Nick to rescue him. They are seen by the residents and Nick is shot. Patrick enters the house during the shootout and finds one of the residents dead. He retreats into the child molester's room, where he finds the boy's dead body; he then shoots the child molester in the back of the head in a fit of rage.
Nick later dies of his wounds. Trying to alleviate Patrick's guilt over the events at the house, Remy unthinkingly confides that he once planted evidence on someone with the help of ""Skinny Ray"" ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ whom he had initially told Patrick he didn't know. After Nick's funeral, Patrick speaks to a police officer, who tells him that Remy had been asking about the drug lord's stolen money before the drug lord knew it was missing. Patrick then questions Beatrice's husband Lionel in a bar and pieces together that Lionel and Remy had conspired to stage a fake kidnapping in order to take the drug money for themselves and to save Amanda from her mother's neglectful parenting. At that point, Remy (trying to cover for his earlier mistake) enters the bar, while wearing a latex mask and holding a shotgun, and stages a robbery. He points the shotgun at Lionel's head, but the bartender shoots Remy twice in the back. Remy flees and is pursued by Patrick to the rooftop of a nearby building, where he dies.
Patrick is questioned by the police about Remy's death and learns that the police never had a phone transcript like the one that Doyle had shown him prior to the botched exchange. Patrick and Angie drive to Doyle's home, where Patrick finds Amanda living happily with Doyle and his wife; Doyle was part of the phony kidnapping all along. Patrick threatens to call the authorities, but Doyle attempts to convince him that Amanda is better off living with them than with her mother. Patrick leaves and discusses the choices with Angie, who says she will leave him if he calls the police, since she believes that Amanda is much better off with the Doyles. In the next scene, the police arrive, Doyle is arrested, Amanda is returned to her mother amidst heavy publicity, and Patrick and Angie break up.
Patrick later visits Amanda as Helene is about to leave on a date with someone she met during the publicity over her daughter's disappearance; at the same time, she makes a play for Patrick himself. Helene informs Patrick that Beatrice has been forbidden to visit and is upset about her husband's arrest. Helene has no babysitter for Amanda and when asked, she tells Patrick that Dottie (Helene's friend) will watch her, even though she has yet to ask Dottie herself. Patrick volunteers to watch Amanda, who is holding her old doll and watching television. Patrick asks Amanda about Mirabelle, only to hear Amanda inform him that her doll's name is ""Annabelle"" ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ implying that Helene did not even know the name of her daughter's favorite toy.","less...,bleak,more...,suspenseful,disturbing,contemplative,tense,rough,atmospheric,captivating,gloomy",1431.jpg,2007-09-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/gone-baby-gone/id432503519?uo=4,itPTyd3DkEw,70065115,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Gone_Baby_Gone/70065115,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
1613,Gosford Park,"The Academy Award winner for Best Original Screenplay, Gosford Park is a whodunit as only director Robert Altman could do it. As a hunting party gathers at the country estate, no one is aware that before the weekend is over, someone will be murdered - twice! The police are baffled but the all-seeing, all-hearing servants know that almost everyone had a motive. This critically-acclaimed murder mystery features a who's who of celebrated actors. With a diverse cast of characters - all with something to hide - it'll keep you guessing right to the surprising end. Gosford Park proves that murder can be such an inconvenience.","Constance, Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), and her lady's maid, Mary Maceachran (Kelly Macdonald) travel to Gosford Park for the weekend. On the way, they encounter actor Ivor Novello (Jeremy Northam), American film producer Morris Weissman (Bob Balaban) and Weissman's valet, Henry Denton (Ryan Phillippe). At the house, they are greeted by Sir William McCordle (Michael Gambon), Lady Sylvia McCordle (Kristin Scott Thomas) and their daughter, Isobel (Camilla Rutherford). The other guests include Lady Sylvia's sisters, Louisa, Lady Stockbridge (Geraldine Somerville) and Lady Lavinia Meredith (Natasha Wightman) and their husbands, Raymond, Lord Stockbridge (Charles Dance) and Commander Anthony Meredith (Tom Hollander). Also in attendance are the Honourable Freddie Nesbitt (James Wilby) and his wife, Mabel (Claudie Blakley); Isobel's suitor, Lord Rupert Standish (Laurence Fox) and his friend Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford).
Commander Meredith is in financial difficulty and brings up the matter with Sir William, who reveals that he is rescinding his investment in Meredith's new scheme. Sir William also intends to stop paying Lady Trentham's allowance. Mary and Lord Stockbridge's valet, Parks (Clive Owen), are attracted to one another. Denton asks a number of questions about life in service and Parks reveals that he was raised in an orphanage. Denton meets Lady Sylvia and during the night, he goes to her room.
During the pheasant shoot Sir William is slightly injured by a low shot. Commander Meredith pleads with Sir William not to back out of the investment. During dinner, Lady Sylvia attacks Sir William, implying that he was a World War I profiteer. The head housemaid, Elsie (Emily Watson), rises to his defence, thus revealing their affair. Sir William goes to the library, where the housekeeper, Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren) brings him coffee. He demands a glass of whisky instead. Lady Sylvia asks Mr. Novello to entertain the guests. George (Richard E. Grant, first footman), Parks, Mr. Nesbitt and Commander Meredith disappear and an unknown man goes to the library and stabs Sir William. Commander Meredith and Mr. Nesbitt do not offer an explanation of their disappearances, while George was fetching milk for the coffee service and Parks was fetching hot water bottles. Lady Stockbridge goes to the library and her screams bring everyone to the room.
Inspector Thomson (Stephen Fry) and Constable Dexter (Ron Webster) arrive to investigate the murder. Dexter suggests that Sir William was already dead when he was stabbed. Denton confesses to Jennings (Alan Bates), the butler, that he is not a valet but an American actor preparing for a movie role. The next morning, Lady Sylvia goes for her morning ride, which surprises Inspector Thomson. Barnes (Adrian Scarborough) overhears Commander Meredith tell Lady Lavinia that Sir William's death was lucky for them, as the investment is now secure. Barnes tells Inspector Thomson, who interrogates Meredith.
Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins) tells the kitchen maid, Bertha (Teresa Churcher), that Sir William was known for seducing the women working in his factories. If a woman became pregnant, Sir William offered two choices: keep the baby and lose your job, or give the baby up and keep your job. Those who gave up their babies were told that the adoptions were being arranged with good families. In reality, Sir William paid orphanages to take the children. Mary goes to Parks' room and tells him that she knows he is the murderer. Parks tells her that he discovered Sir William was his father, entered service and attempted to gain employment with someone in his circle. Parks tells Mary that he did not poison Sir William and Mary is relieved, as Parks only stabbed the corpse.
Mary listens to Lady Sylvia and Lady Trentham discussing why Mrs. Croft and Mrs. Wilson are enemies. Lady Sylvia believes that the tension between them stems from the fact that Mrs. Wilson now outranks Mrs. Croft. Lady Trentham asks if Mrs. Wilson was ever married and Lady Sylvia replies that her name was once Parks or Parker. Mary goes to Mrs. Wilson and the older woman reveals that she poisoned Sir William in order to protect her son, as she knew that Parks was there to kill Sir William. She also reveals that she and Mrs. Croft are sisters. After talking to Dorothy (Sophie Thompson), Mrs. Wilson goes to her room and is comforted by Mrs. Croft. The guests leave and Lady Sylvia enters Gosford Park, while Jennings closes the door.","murder,biting,mystery,witty,stylized,clever,killer,atmospheric,whodunnit,anticipation,captivating,fear",1613.jpg,2001-11-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/gosford-park/id284989889?uo=4,Km4gZMrF96g,60021796,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Gosford_Park/60021796,"Comedy,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Damon stars as Roy Miller, a rogue U.S. Army officer who must hunt through covert and faulty intelligence hidden on foreign soil before war escalates in an unstable region. Also starring Academy Award nominees Greg Kinnear and Amy Ryan, Green Zone is one hell of a thriller (Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times).","United 93 director Paul Greengrass explores the aftermath of the Iraq invasion in this feature adaptation of author Rajiv Chandrasekaran's literary expose Imperial Life in the Emerald City: Inside Iraq's Green Zone. A onetime Baghdad bureau chief of the Washington Post, Chandrasekaran was present as American forces attempted to set up a provisional government on the grounds surrounding former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's opulent palace. The resulting governing body, according to critics, existed in a bubble so far-removed from the grim realities of the Iraq War that it failed to properly assess the needs of the people. In this fictional thriller set during the U.S.-led occupation of Baghdad, director Greengrass and screenwriter Brian Helgeland use Chandrasekaran's journalistic account as the foundation for the story of an officer who joins forces with a senior CIA officer to unearth evidence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Chief Warrant Officer Roy Miller (Matt Damon) is certain that Hussein has been stockpiling WMDs in the Iraqi desert, but in their race from one empty site to the next, they soon stumble across evidence of an elaborate cover up. As a result, Miller realizes that operatives on both sides of the conflict are attempting to spin the story in their favor. Now, as Miller searches for answers made ever more elusive by covert and faulty intelligence, the truth becomes the most valuable weapon of all. Will those answers prove pivotal in clearing a rogue regime, or escalate the war in a region that grows increasingly unstable with each passing day?

252,Groundhog Day,"Do you ever have deja vu? Didn't you just ask me that? Bill Murray is at his wry, wisecracking best in this riotous romantic comedy about a weatherman caught in a personal time warp on the worst day of his life. Teamed with a relentlessly cheerful producer (Andie MacDowell) and a smart-aleck cameraman (Chris Elliott), TV weatherman Phil Connors (Bill Murray) is sent to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities. But on his way out of town, Phil is caught in a giant blizzard, which he failed to predict, and finds himself stuck in small-town hell. Just when things couldn't get worse, they get worse; Phil wakes the next morning to find it's Groundhog Day all over again... and again... and again. Cheered by critics as Bill Murray's best movie ever.","Self-centered TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Murray), news producer Rita (MacDowell), and cameraman Larry (Elliott), of Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9, travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on February 1st. Their assignment is to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities on February 2nd. Phil, who doesn't like the assignment or the town, grudgingly gives his report on the festivities. He then gets his team on the road back to Pittsburgh, but a blizzard shuts down all travel. The team is forced to return to town and stay another night.
Phil wakes up to find that he is reliving February 2. The day plays out exactly as it did before, with no one but Phil aware of the time loop. At first he is confused, but, when the phenomenon continues on subsequent days, he decides to take advantage of the situation with no fear of long-term consequences: he learns secrets from the town's residents, seduces women, steals money, drives recklessly, and gets thrown in jail. However, his attempts to get closer to Rita, to whom he has become attracted, repeatedly fail.
Eventually, Phil becomes despondent and tries more and more drastically to end the time loop; he gives ridiculous and offensive reports on the festival, abuses residents, eventually kidnaps Punxsutawney Phil and, after a police chase, drives off a high overlook into a quarry, evidently killing both himself and the groundhog. However, Phil wakes up and finds that nothing has changed; further attempts at suicide are just as fruitless, as he continues to find himself waking at six o'clock on the morning of February 2 with the clock radio on his nightstand playing ""I Got You Babe"" by Sonny & Cher.
When Phil explains the situation to Rita, she suggests that he should take advantage of it to improve himself. Inspired, Phil endeavours to try to learn more about Rita, building upon his knowledge of her and the town each day. He begins to use his by-now vast experience of the day to help as many people around town as possible. He uses the time to learn, among other things, how to play the piano, how to sculpt ice, and how to speak both Italian and French.
Eventually, Phil is able to befriend almost everyone he meets during the day, using his experiences to save lives, help townspeople, and to get closer to Rita. He crafts a report on the Groundhog Day celebration so eloquent that all the other stations turn their microphones to him. After the town's evening dance on February 2nd, Rita ""buys"" Phil at the event's auction. They retire together to Phil's room. He wakes the next morning and finds the time loop is broken; it is now February 3 and Rita is still with him. After going outside, Phil talks about living in Punxsutawney with Rita.","whatif,mindandsoul,love,feelgood,deja vu,overandoveragain,smile,introspection,soulmate,anticipation,fishoutofwater,nothinggoesright,cynical,oppositesattract,hopes,smalltown,dryhumor,worstday,disorder,datenight,repetition,unfulfillment,crush,joy,witty,imaginary,believe,cute,usa,aughter,wooing,obsession,loop,dejavu,hypothesis,offbeat,loveandromance,sentimental,timewarp,groundhog,faith,prediction,humorous,pennsylvania,romcom,serendipity,predict,fallinlove,roadnottaken,feel good,clever,laughter,redemption",252.jpg,1993-02-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/groundhog-day/id270870214?uo=4,tSVeDx9fk60,563104,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Groundhog_Day/563104,"Comedy,Romance,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

3232,Hail the Conquering Hero,"Academy Award winning writer and director Preston Sturges (Sullivan's Travels) delivers a hilarious satire on the American penchant for hero worship in Hail the Conquering Hero. Born on the day his father died a hero in WWI, Woodrow Truesmith (Eddie Bracken) enlists proudly when WWII begins. Although anxious to serve his country, Woodrow is quickly discharged because of his chronic hay fever. Ashamed to return, the ""conquering hero"" manages to dupe his girlfriend, friends and entire hometown by having his buddies forward his letters from the ""Pacific."" Nominated for a Best Original Screenplay Academy Award, this quick-witted comedy classic showcases the talents of Preston Sturges at his best.","Woodrow Lafayette Pershing Truesmith (Eddie Bracken) is a small town boy whose father, ""Hinky Dinky"" Truesmith, was a Marine who died a hero in World War I. Woodrow has been discharged from the Marine Corps after only a month owing to his chronic hay fever. Rather than disappoint his mother (Georgia Caine), he pretends to be fighting overseas in World War II while secretly working in a San Diego shipyard.
In a chance encounter in a bar he buys a round of drinks for six Marines back from the Battle of Guadalcanal headed by Master Gunnery Sergeant Heppelfinger (William Demarest). It transpires Heppelfinger had served with Woodrow's father in the 6th Marines in World War I. One of the Marines decides to telephone Woodrow's mother, telling her that he has received a medical discharge, so she will not have to worry about him. Woodrow is vehemently opposed to the fraud, but the Marines are all for it. Heppelfinger embellishes the charade by having Woodrow swap coats with one of the Marines that have the 1st Marine Division Battle Blaze and Pacific Theatre of Operations medals on it.
When they step off the train, the seemingly harmless deception has escalated beyond control; the entire town turns out to greet its homegrown hero. With an election coming up, the citizens decide to make an unwilling Woodrow their candidate against the pompous current mayor, Mr. Noble (Raymond Walburn). Complicating matters even further, Woodrow had written his girlfriend Libby (Ella Raines), telling her not to wait for him.

3510,Halloween,"The legendary all-time horror classic! Many years ago, Michael Myers brutally massacred his sister. Now , after escaping from a mental hospital, he's back to relive his grisly crime again, and again...and again.","On Halloween night, 1963, in fictional Haddonfield, Illinois, 6-year-old Michael Myers (Will Sandin) murders his older teenage sister Judith (Sandy Johnson), stabbing her repeatedly with a butcher knife, after she had sex with her boyfriend. Fifteen years later, on October 30, 1978, Michael escapes the hospital in Smith's Grove, Illinois where he had been committed since the murder, stealing the car that was to take him to a court hearing.
The following day ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Halloween ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ in Haddonfield, high school student Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) continually sees Michael, now wearing dark blue coveralls and a white mask, first at her school, then on the street. Laurie's friends, Annie (Nancy Kyes) and Lynda (P. J. Soles), dismiss Laurie's concerns. Then, later at her house, she sees Michael outside, in the yard, staring into her room. Laurie is startled and unnerved. Meanwhile, Michael's primary psychiatrist, Dr. Samuel Loomis (Donald Pleasance), having anticipated Michael's return home, goes to the local cemetery, finding that Judith Myers' headstone is missing. Later on, Loomis approaches Annie's father, Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers), and the two quietly look for Michael.
That night, Laurie babysits a boy named Tommy Doyle (Brian Andrews), while Annie babysits a girl named Lindsey Wallace (Kyle Richards) across the street from the Doyle house. When Annie gets a call from her boyfriend, Paul, to pick him up, she takes Lindsey to the Doyle house. Annie gets in her car to pick up Paul but she is killed by Michael, who was hiding in the back of her car. At the Doyle House, Tommy spots Michael carrying Annie's body and tries to tell Laurie, who dismisses his claims as the boogeyman. Later, Lynda and her boyfriend, Bob, enter the Wallace house and head to the bedroom, where they have sex. While downstairs, Bob is impaled on the wall with a kitchen knife, then Michael strangles Lynda with a telephone cord as she talks on the phone with Laurie.
Feeling unsettled, Laurie heads over to the Wallace house, only to find Annie's body with Judith Myers' missing headstone along with Lynda and Bob. Suddenly, Laurie is attacked by Michael and falls backwards down the staircase. She runs out of the house, screaming for help, but to no avail. Eventually, she flees back to the Doyle house, but the door is locked as she sees Michael approaching in the distance. Laurie screams for Tommy to open the door quickly. Luckily, Tommy opens the door in time and lets Laurie inside. Laurie then instructs the children to hide and then realizes that the phone is dead, and that Michael has gotten into the house through a window. As she sits down in horror next to the couch, her hand falls on a knitting needle. Michael appears and tries to stab her, but she counterattacks his move, and stabs him in the neck with the knitting needle.
Laurie makes her way to an upstairs bedroom and tell Tommy and Lindsey it's all over, but Michael appears to have survived Laurie's counterattack and continues to go after Laurie. She orders the kids to go in the bathroom and lock the door and attempted to hide in the closet by herself, but Michael later found out that she is in the closet by breaking a hole in the door and tries to kill Laurie for the last time. Laurie attacks by stabbing Michael in the eye with a clothes hanger. Michael collapses and Laurie exits the closet carefully before telling the kids to go call for help. Meanwhile, outside, Dr. Loomis sees Tommy and Lindsey running away from the house and suspects that Michael could be inside. Michael gets up and tries to strangle Laurie, but Dr. Loomis arrives in time to save her and shoots Michael six times in the chest. Michael falls from the second-story window, onto the lawn below. Laurie asks Loomis if that was the ""boogeyman"", to which Loomis says it was. When Dr. Loomis looks over the balcony, he finds Michael's body is missing.","killer,mask,fear",3510.jpg,1978-10-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/halloween/id474744385?uo=4,IeQiSdznHGo,569090,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Halloween/569090,Horror
3037,Hamlet,"Winner of four Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor, Sir Laurence Olivier‚Äö√Ñ√¥s Hamlet continues to be the most compelling version of Shakespeare‚Äö√Ñ√¥s beloved tragedy. Olivier is at his most inspired as director and as the melancholy Dane himself he breathes new life into the words of one of the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s greatest dramatists.","William Shakespeare's tale of tragedy of murder and revenge in the royal halls of medieval Denmark. Claudius, brother to the King, conniving with the Queen, poisons the monarch and seizes the throne, taking the widowed Gertrude for his bride. Hamlet, son of the murdered King, mournful of his father's death and mother's hasty marriage, is confronted by the ghost of the late King who reveals the manner of his murder. Seeking revenge, Hamlet recreates the monstrous deed in a play with the help of some traveling actors to torment the conscience of the evil Claudius. In a visit with his mother, Hamlet expresses his anger and disappointment concerning her swiftly untimed marriage. Thinking a concealed spy in his mother's chamber to be the lurking Claudius, he mistakenly kills the meddling counselor, Polonius, father of Ophelia and Laertes. Claudius, on the pretext that Hamlet will be endangered by his subjects for the murder of Polonius, sends the prince to England.

2991,Hamlet 2,"One high school drama teacher is about to make a huge number 2 in this wildly irreverent and completely outrageous movie from the producers of Little Miss Sunshine! When his school's theatre department is threatened to be cut, failed-actor-turned-high-school-drama-teacher Dana Marschz writes a play that he hopes will solve everything: a sequel to Shakespeare's Hamlet. Now, staging one of the most politically incorrect musical-theater extravaganzas ever seen, Dana and his class will put it all on the line for one controversial, conflicted night of hilarity!","Dana Marschz (Steve Coogan) is a recovering alcoholic and failed actor who has become a high school drama teacher in Tucson, Arizona, ""where dreams go to die"". Despite considering himself an inspirational figure, he only has two enthusiastic students, Rand (Skylar Astin) and Epiphany (Phoebe Strole), and a history of producing poorly-received school plays that are essentially stage adaptations of popular Hollywood films (his latest being Erin Brockovich). When the new term begins, a new intake of students are forced to transfer into his class as it is the only remaining arts elective available due to budget cutbacks; they are mostly unenthusiastic and unconvinced by Dana‚Äö√Ñ√¥s pretentions, and Dana comes into conflict with Octavio (Joseph Julian Soria), one of the new students.
Dana is floored when Principal Rocker (Marshall Bell) notifies him that the drama program is to be shut down at the end of the term. Seeking to inspire his students, Dana undertakes to write and produce an original play: a sequel to Hamlet featuring time travel to avoid the deaths of the characters, and new, more controversial content, including the introduction of Jesus Christ (played by Marschz) as one of the characters, complete with a song-and-dance number titled ""Rock Me Sexy Jesus."" The kids gradually warm to the project, but Rand ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ cast as a bi-curious Laertes and overshadowed by Octavio as Hamlet ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ storms out of the drama group and provides a copy of the play‚Äö√Ñ√¥s script to Principal Rocker, who orders Dana to stop the controversial production.
Dana is further traumatized when his wife Brie (Catherine Keener) leaves him for the uninteresting, but fertile, boarder Gary (David Arquette) they had taken into their home to supplement their modest income, and reveals that he himself is infertile. Despondent, Dana falls off the wagon and tries to abandon the project, but his students encourage him to continue, arranging an abandoned warehouse and rave spot, technical assistance, and security being provided by the high school's football and wrestling teams. Dana also learns that the cancellation of the play has become a civil liberties issue encouraged by fanatical ACLU activist Cricket Feldstein (Amy Poehler). As a result, the play opens to a sold-out house, including a critic from The New York Times. Rand returns to the group, apologizing for his desertion; Dana allows him to return to the role of Laertes.
The play itself initially meets with a mixed reception, due to its controversial content and mangling of the original play; in keeping with a running joke throughout the movie, much of the content revolves around the characters using time travel to mend their troubled relationships with their fathers; it ends with both Hamlet and Jesus forgiving their fathers for the wrongs done to them. Although initially reluctant to engage with the play, with several protesters infiltrating the audience to stage a direct protest, the play gradually wins the audience over. The film ends with Dana and his favorite actress, Elisabeth Shue ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ who he is now dating ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ meeting Dana‚Äö√Ñ√¥s students to prepare for the show's Broadway opening, complete with original cast.","witty,exciting,humorous,biting",2991.jpg,2008-08-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hamlet-2/id299456875?uo=4,,70087395,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hamlet_2/70087395,Comedy
31,Hancock,"Academy Award nominee Will Smith (Best Actor, The Pursuit of Happyness, 2006) stars in this action-packed comedy as Hancock, a sarcastic, hard-living and misunderstood superhero who has fallen out of favor with the public. When Hancock grudgingly agrees to an extreme makeover from idealistic publicist Ray Embrey (Jason Bateman, Juno), his life and reputation rise from the ashes and all seems right again--until he meets a woman (2003 Academy Award winner Charlize Theron, Best Actress, Monster) with similar powers to his and the key to his secret past.","John Hancock (Smith) is an alcoholic man with superpowers (including flight, invulnerability, immortality, and superhuman strength). Though he uses his powers to stop criminals in his current city of residence (Los Angeles), his activity inadvertently causes millions of dollars in property damage due to his constant intoxication. As a result, he is routinely jeered at crime scenes. Hancock also ignores court subpoenas from the city of Los Angeles to address the property damage he has caused.
When public relations spokesperson Ray Embrey (Bateman) departs from an unsuccessful meeting pitching his All-Heart logo for corporations that are extraordinarily charitable, he becomes trapped on railroad tracks with an oncoming freight train. Hancock saves Ray's life, but he causes the train to derail and nearly injures another driver. Other drivers jeer Hancock for causing more damage, but Ray steps in and thanks Hancock for saving his life. Ray offers to improve Hancock's public image, and Hancock grudgingly accepts. The spokesperson convinces the alcoholic superhero to permit himself to be jailed for outstanding subpoenas so they can show Los Angeles how much the city really needs Hancock. When the crime rate rises after Hancock's incarceration, the Chief of Police contacts the superhero. With a new costume from Ray, Hancock intervenes with a bank robbery, rescuing a cop and stopping the leader of the robbers, Red Parker (Marsan).
After the rescue, Hancock is applauded for handling the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular once more, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and his wife Mary (Theron), to whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia from 1931, about 80 years ago. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, he discovers that Mary also has superhuman powers. He threatens to expose her until she explains their origins; she explains they have lived for 3,000 years with their powers, having been called gods and angels in their time. She adds that they are the last of their kind and that their kind are paired. Mary does not tell Hancock the entire truth, and Hancock departs to tell Ray about the conversation. The exchange results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers like Hancock.
Hancock is later shot twice in the chest and wounded when he stops a liquor store robbery. He is hospitalized, and Mary visits and explains that as the pair of immortals gets close, they begin to lose their powers. She also explains that Hancock was attacked in an alley almost 80 years prior, causing his amnesia. Mary deserted him then in order for him to recover from his injuries.
When Hancock is hospitalized, the hospital is raided by Red Parker, the bank robber, and two men whom Hancock had humiliated during his incarceration. Mary, visiting Hancock, is shot in the process. Hancock is able to stop two men but is further wounded by them. When Red attempts to finish Hancock off, Ray comes to the rescue and disarms and kills the bank robber with a fire axe. With Mary nearly dying, Hancock flees from the hospital so their parting will allow her to heal with her powers.
Hancock later winds up in New York City, working as a superhero. Ray is seen walking with Mary discussing historical events, such as the reign of Attila the Hun, in a jovial manner. Out of gratitude to Ray, Hancock paints Ray's All-Heart logo on the moon and calls the spokesperson to look up at the worldwide advertisement.","powers,joy,losangeles,drunk,anti-hero,savetheday,misfit,anticipation,superhero,hiddenidentity,hero,cynical,marketing,fightingcrime,trust,humorous,superhuman,anti hero,strategic forecast,exciting,rivalry,memoryloss,alcohol,surprise,antihero,brand strategists,redemption",31.jpg,2008-07-02, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hancock/id293708765?uo=4,7E_Sg27AXC8,70097577,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hancock/70097577,"Action & Adventure,Comedy,Drama"
1556,Hannibal,"Based on the best selling novel by Thomas Harris, ""Hannibal"" continues the story begun in ""The Silence of the Lambs."" Seven years have passed since Dr. Hannibal Lecter escaped from custody, seven years since FBI Agent Clarice Starling interviewed him in a maximum-security hospital for the criminally insane. The doctor is now at large in Italy, pursuing his own interests, savoring the scents, the essences of the unguarded world. But Starling has never forgotten her encounters with Dr. Lecter, his seldom-used voice still haunts her dreams. Mason Verger remembers Dr. Lecter as well, and is obsessed with revenge.  Verger was Dr. Lecter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s sixth victim, and although hideously disfigured, he survived. In order to draw Dr. Lecter into the open, Verger uses Clarice Starling as bait.","Ten years after tracking down serial killer Jame Gumb, F.B.I. Special Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is unjustly blamed for a bungled drug raid. Starling and her connection to Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) come to the attention of Lecter's only surviving victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a wealthy child molester whom Lecter left horribly disfigured and paralyzed after having been assigned as Verger's court-appointed therapist.
Verger uses his immense wealth and political influence to have Starling reassigned to Lecter's case and meets with her in his mansion. Verger is pursuing an elaborate scheme to capture, torture, and kill Lecter, and hopes Starling's involvement will draw him out. Indeed, Lecter sends her a taunting letter after learning of her public disgrace. Though the letter contains no clue to Lecter's whereabouts, Starling detects a strange fragrance that a perfume expert later identifies as a bespoke skin cream whose ingredients are only available to a few shops in the world. She contacts the police departments of the cities where the shops are located, requesting surveillance tapes. One of the cities is Florence, Italy, where Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) is investigating the disappearance of a library curator. Pazzi questions Lecter, who is masquerading as ""Dr. Fell"", the assistant curator and now caretaker of the library.
Upon recognizing Dr. Fell in the surveillance tape, Pazzi accesses the F.B.I.'s ViCAP database of wanted fugitives. He learns of Verger's US$3 million reward to anyone turning Lecter over to him rather than to the F.B.I. Lured by Verger's bounty, Pazzi ignores Starling's warnings against trying to capture Lecter alone. He recruits a pickpocket to obtain a fingerprint of Lecter to show as proof of Lecter's whereabouts and thus collect the reward. Lecter mortally wounds the pickpocket, who nonetheless manages to get the print and provide it to Pazzi, who in turn contacts Verger. Lecter then baits Pazzi into an isolated room of the library, ties him up with electrical cords, and hangs and disembowels him, before escaping back to the United States.
Verger bribes U.S. Justice Department official Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) to accuse Starling of withholding a note from Lecter, leading to her suspension. Lecter lures Starling to Union Station but Verger's men, who have followed Starling, capture Lecter and transport him to Verger. When her superiors refuse to act, Starling, on her own initiative, infiltrates Verger's estate. Verger means to have Lecter eaten alive by a herd of wild boars bred specifically for this purpose. Starling intervenes to free Lecter but is herself wounded, and Lecter rescues her from the voracious animals. Verger furiously orders his private physician Cordell (‚âàŒ©eljko Ivanek) to shoot Lecter, but instead Lecter persuades Cordell to throw his hated employer into the pen, where he is eaten alive by the boars.
Lecter takes a sedated Starling to Krendler's secluded lake house and treats her wounds. When Krendler arrives for the Fourth of July break, Lecter subdues and drugs him. Starling, disoriented by morphine and dressed in a slinky black velvet cocktail dress, awakens to find Lecter cooking and Krendler in a wheelchair seated at the table set for an elegant dinner. Weakened by the drugs, she looks on in confusion and horror as Lecter removes the top of Krendler's skull, cuts out part of his prefrontal cortex, saut‚àö¬©es it, and feeds Krendler his own brain.
After the meal, Starling tries to attack Lecter but he quickly overpowers her. She manages to handcuff his wrist to hers, and with police incoming to the residence, Lecter brandishes a meat cleaver and severs his left hand to escape. Lecter is later seen on a flight with a boxed lunch on his pull-down table. As he prepares to eat his meal, including a small cooked portion of what is assumed to be Krendler's brain, a young boy seated next to him asks to try some of his food. Lecter lets the boy eat some of his lunch, telling him that ""it is important... to always try new things.""","specialagent,lawenforcement,stylized,skin,doctor,fbi,insane,bleak,criminal,lambs,vengeance,psychopath,cannibal,starling,mindgame,serialkiller,rough,silenceofthelambs,mastercriminal,silence of thelambs,rivalry,suspenseful,crime,clarice,atmospheric,canibal,fear",1556.jpg,2001-02-09,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hannibal/id271874890?uo=4 ,eHSYth2wSEk,60001822,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hannibal/60001822,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

As the fabled Blood Moon approaches, the siblings encounter a new form of evil that might hold a secret to their past.","Abandoned by their father deep in a forest, young Hansel and Gretel enter a gingerbread house and are nabbed by the old witch who resides in it. The witch forces Hansel to continuously eat candy while making Gretel prepare the oven, but the siblings outsmart her and shove her into the fire. Throughout the fifteen years after the incident, Hansel and Gretel become famed bounty hunters dedicated to mercilessly exterminating witches. Their work is relatively easy because, for an unknown reason, they are immune to spells and curses. Hansel, however, is diabetic as a result of his ordeal and needs to take a regular shot of insulin every few hours..
One day, in the town of Augsburg, Hansel and Gretel prevent Sheriff Berringer from executing Mina, a young woman accused of witchcraft. Mayor Englemann has hired the siblings to find and rescue several children abducted by witches. Berringer hires trackers for the same mission, hoping to regain the respect of the Mayor. However, all but one of the party are killed that night by the powerful grand witch Muriel, who sends the surviving member back to the town tavern to explode as a warning to the locals. Hansel and Gretel, with the help of the Mayor's deputy Jackson, capture a witch and interrogate her. They discover that the witches are preparing for the ritual of Blood Moon, which requires sacrificing six boys and six girls, each born on a separate month.

Meanwhile, Gretel enters the forest to search for him, but she is assaulted by Berringer and his men for luring the witches to their town. She is rescued when Edward arrives and mutilates the men and mends her injuries. When Gretel asks why he saved her, Edward answers that trolls serve witches and walk away. Hansel and Gretel reunite at an abandoned cabin, which they discover is not only their childhood home, but also a witch's lair. Muriel appears in front of them, telling them the truth of their past. She reveals that Hansel and Gretel's mother was a grand white witch named Adrianna, married to a farmer. On the night of the Blood Moon, the heart of a white witch is needed to create a potion that makes witches impervious to fire. As Adrianna was too powerful, Muriel targeted Gretel, who was revealed to be a white witch herself. Muriel spread a rumor across the village about Adrianna. To keep the siblings away from the mob of villagers, their father left them in the forest before he was hanged, while their mother was burned at the stake. Following this revelation, the siblings battle Muriel before she stabs Hansel and abducts Gretel for the ceremony.
Hansel wakes up to the sight of Mina, who reveals herself to be a white witch. After Mina uses a spell to bless the siblings' arsenal, Hansel, Mina, and Ben head to disrupt the Blood Moon Sabbath. Whilst Mina mows down dozens of witches with a Gatling gun, Hansel squares off against Muriel's minions and frees the children, while Edward defies Muriel's orders and releases Gretel before Muriel throws him off the cliff. Muriel attempts to flee, but Ben shoots her off her broomstick. On her way to meet up with Hansel, Gretel finds Edward and uses her stun gun to defibrillate him back to life.

1648,Happy Feet,"In the great nation of Emperor Penguins, deep in Antarctica, you're nobody unless you can sing - which is unfortunate for Mumble (Elijah Wood), who is the worst singer in the world. He is born dancing to his own tune...tap dancing. As fate would have it, his one friend, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), happens to be the best singer around. Mumble and Gloria have a connection from the moment they hatch, but she struggles with his strange ""hippity- hoppity"" ways. Away from home for the first time, Mumble meets a posse of decidedly un-Emperor-like penguins - the Adelie Amigos. Led by Ramon (Robin Williams), the Adelies instantly embrace Mumble's cool dance moves and invite him to party with them. In Adelie Land, Mumble seeks the counsel of Lovelace the Guru (also voiced by Robin Williams), a crazy-feathered Rockhopper penguin who will answer any of life's questions for the price of a pebble. Together with Lovelace and the Amigos, Mumble sets out across vast landscapes and, after some epic encounters, proves that by being true to yourself, you can make all the difference in the world.","Every Emperor Penguin sings a unique song called a ""heartsong"" to attract a mate. If the male penguin's heartsong matches the female's song, the two penguins mate. Norma Jean, a female penguin, falls for Memphis, a male penguin and they become mates. They lay an egg, which is left in Memphis' care, while Norma Jean leaves with the other females to fish. While the males struggle through the harsh winter, Memphis briefly drops the egg. The resulting chick, Mumble, has no vocal talent, but can tap dance. Nevertheless, he is enamored with Gloria, a female penguin who is regarded as the most talented of his age. One day, Mumble encounters a group of hostile Skua, with a leader who is tagged with a yellow band, which he claims to have been from an alien abduction. Mumble narrowly escapes the hungry birds by falling into a crevice.
Years later, an adult Mumble is now an outcast who is frowned upon by his elders. After being shunned during the graduates' song, he is attacked by a leopard seal. After escaping, he befriends a group of Adelie Penguins called ""the Amigos"", who embrace Mumble's dance moves and assimilate him into their group. After seeing a hidden human excavator in an avalanche, they opt to ask Lovelace, a Rockhopper Penguin, about its origin. Lovelace has the plastic rings of a six pack entangled around his neck, which he claims to have been bestowed upon him by mystic beings.
For the emperor penguins, it is mating season and Gloria is the center of attention. Ramon tries to help Mumble win her affection by singing a Spanish version of ""My Way"", with Mumble lip syncing. When Gloria sees Ramon behind Mumble's back, she becomes angry and turns away. As a last resort, Mumble begins tap dancing in synch with her song. She falls for him and all the youthful penguins join in for singing and dancing to ""Boogie Wonderland"". The elders are appalled by Mumble's conduct, which they see as the reason for their lean fishing season. Memphis begs Mumble to stop dancing, for his own sake, but when Mumble refuses, he is banished.
Mumble and the Amigos return to Lovelace, only to find him being choked by the plastic rings. Lovelace confesses they were snagged on him while swimming off the forbidden shores, beyond the land of the elephant seals. Not long into their journey, they are met by Gloria, who wishes to join with Mumble as his mate. Fearing for his safety, he ostracizes her, driving her away.
At the forbidden shore, the group finds a fishing boat. Mumble pursues it solo to the brink of exhaustion. He is eventually washed up on the shore of Australia, where he is rescued and kept at Marine World with Magellanic Penguins. After a long and secluded confinement, he nearly succumbs to madness. When a girl attempts to interact with Mumble by tapping the glass, he starts dancing, which attracts a large crowd. He is released back into the wild, with a tracking device attached to his back. He returns to his colony and challenges the will of the elders. Memphis reconciles with him, just as a research team arrives, proving the aliens to be true. The whole of the colony engages in dance.

3342,Happy Gilmore,"Adam Sandler stars as Happy Gilmore in the over-the-top comedy that scores a hole in one for hilarity. After his dream of stardom on the hockey ice melts, Happy Gilmore discovers he has a gift that could bring him glory on the greens. Trouble is, with his hot head and hard-hitting drives, Happy doesn‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢t just play golf‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√áhe destroys it. With the help of a retired golfer (Carl Weathers) and hot publicist (Julie Bowen), can Happy perfect his game and tame his temper to win the tournament prize money? With unforgettable appearances by Bob Barker, Christopher McDonald and Kevin Nealon, this comedy favorite features non-stop laughs that are par for the course!","Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) is an aspiring ice hockey player who possesses a powerful and dangerous slapshot that his late father taught him as a child. However, Happy also possesses an overaggressive streak and lack of skating talent that consistently preclude him from joining a hockey team. His grandmother (Frances Bay), who raised him after his father died, has not paid her taxes for many years. As such, she owes $270,000 to the IRS, and the house that Happy's grandfather ""built with his bare hands"" is about to be seized. Gilmore has only 3 months to come up with the money or else the house will be sold. Grandma Gilmore is forced to temporarily move into a retirement home, run by a sadistic manager named Hal (Ben Stiller in an uncredited role).
While repossessing Grandma's furniture, a pair of movers challenge Happy to hit golf balls. With his unorthodox, hockey slapshot-style swing, he hits the ball 400 yards three times, winning $40 as a result. This gives Happy the idea to go to the driving range to hustle golfers with his swing. When his progress is noticed by former golf star and current club pro Chubbs Peterson (Carl Weathers), whose pro golf career ended when his right hand was bitten off by an alligator, he convinces Happy to enter a local tournament by telling him he can make the money to buy back his grandmother's house. Happy wins the tournament and earns a spot on the Pro Golf Tour (fictionalized golf tour based on the PGA Tour). Chubbs advises Happy to hold off on joining the tour for six months, so that Chubbs can make him a better all-around golfer. Against Chubbs' advice, Happy joins the tour immediately.
On the tour, Happy makes an instant enemy of pretentious and arrogant star Shooter McGavin (Christopher McDonald), who sees Happy as both a detriment to golf and a threat to his career. In addition, Happy discovers that although he has a powerful drive, his putting is terrible, and his violent outbursts and lack of golf etiquette eventually prompt Shooter to ask Doug Thompson (Dugan), the commissioner of the tour, to expel Happy. But Happy's antics are garnering the tour's highest television ratings, increasing attendance, drawing more youthful sponsors, and Happy isn't breaking any rules, and Shooter's request is denied. To help Happy cool down and start acting more professionally, tour PR head Virginia Venit (Julie Bowen) is assigned to him by the tour. In addition to a romance forming between the two, Happy tells Virginia the truth of why he entered the tour and she agrees to keep it between them. Happy begins to develop a cooler head while continuing to improve in tournaments much to the chagrin of Shooter, who decides to take matters into his own hands and hire Donald (Joe Flaherty), a mentally unbalanced fan, to heckle Happy at the next tournament, the Pepsi Pro-Am, a tournament where tour pros team up with celebrities.
At the tournament, Happy is paired with Bob Barker, then host/executive producer of the long-running CBS Daytime game show, The Price Is Right. Donald immediately starts taunting and distracting him by calling Happy a jackass, taking Happy's focus off his game so much that he plays terribly. Exasperated at Happy's poor performance, Barker even begins heckling him before they break into a full-scale brawl (which Barker wins). As a result, Happy is suspended from the tour and fined $25,000. All is not lost as Happy secures an endorsement deal with Subway, which gives him enough money to buy back Grandma's house and pay the fine.
However, Happy discovers that the house is to be sold at an auction ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ something he did not know before. Despite bidding the entire sum of his endorsement deal, Happy is summarily outbid by Shooter, who has purchased the house to leverage a deal with Happy ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ he will let him have the house back in return for quitting the tour. As the house was his sole reason for entering, Happy immediately agrees, but is dissuaded by Virginia, who tells him that his Grandma would rather see him succeed at life than have the house, and that his true talent lies in golfing, not hockey. Happy then decides to make a bet with his rival based on the upcoming Tour Championship ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ if Happy places higher than Shooter, he gets the house back, but if Happy finishes behind Shooter he will leave the tour; Shooter agrees. Although Virginia is confident Happy will win, Happy is not as sure and seeks the help of Chubbs. Happy finally admits his own mistakes and agrees to work with Chubbs. Together they head to a miniature golf course so Happy can improve his putting, which he does. Pleased with Happy's progress, Chubbs gives his protege a modified putter, fashioned in the shape of a hockey stick, as a present to use for the tournament. In return, Happy presents Chubbs with the head of the alligator that took his hand (which Happy had killed in a previous tournament). Horrified by the sight, Chubbs reels backward and falls out an open window to his death.
Determined to win the tournament for Chubbs, Happy is evenly matched with Shooter after the first two rounds. Shooter is stunned that Happy has been keeping up with him, and by the end of the third day of the tournament, Happy is leading Shooter. In desperation, Shooter once again calls on Donald. The next day Shooter's plan comes into action, as Donald hits Happy with a Volkswagen Beetle, which he proceeds to ram into a television tower at the 18th hole. An injured Happy refuses to forfeit the tournament, but quickly discovers that he has lost the ability to hit the long drive and drops from the lead by several shots heading into the final holes. However, after applying a lesson from Chubbs, and receiving an important morale boost from Grandma, he is able to refocus and ties Shooter going to the 18th hole. After Shooter makes his shot for par, the TV tower collapses and blocks Happy's putt for birdie. Happy is forced to take his shot with the tower in the way, and uses what Chubbs taught him on the miniature golf course to make a trick shot to win the Tour Championship and the house.
Afterwards, a hysterical Shooter attempts to steal Happy's gold jacket, but is quickly beaten up by Happy's old boss, Mr. Larson (Richard Kiel), and an angry mob of spectators. The film closes with Happy being congratulated by the two-handed ghost of Chubbs, Abraham Lincoln, and the alligator.","bunker,joy,par,drive,golf,driver,fore,whack,hole in one,eagle,green,crocodile,birdie,luck,humorous,handicap,putting,plastichand,exciting,lucky,flag,skill,feel good,surprise,natural,sandpit",3342.jpg,1996-02-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/happy-gilmore/id279248826?uo=4,y1emDAYCfVQ,70000794,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Happy_Gilmore/70000794,Comedy
3664,Happy-Go-Lucky,"Academy Award nominee Mike Leigh (Best Director and Best Original Screenplay, Vera Drake, 2004), delivers the delightfully fresh and cheerful comedy HappyGoLucky. Free-spirited and effervescent, Poppy is a schoolteacher whose unstoppable optimism guides her life. Bubbling forth with giggles, laughter and jokes, life's a bowl of cherries even when she comes across a few pits. Whether it's a cranky driving teacher or a fiery flamenco instructor, Poppy embraces life on the sunny side of the street. It's a joyous, feel-good film you'll find irresistible.","The film is about a primary school teacher's relationship with a driving instructor, from whom she receives lessons. Thirty years old and single, Pauline ""Poppy"" Cross shares a London flat with her best friend Zoe, a fellow teacher. Poppy is free-minded, high-spirited and kind-hearted. The film opens with Poppy trying to engage a shop employee in conversation. He blatantly ignores her, yet his icy demeanour does not bother her. She maintains her good mood even when she discovers her bicycle has been stolen. Her main concern is not getting a new one or finding the bicycle, but that she did not get a chance to say goodbye to it. This prompts her to decide to learn how to drive.
When Poppy takes driving lessons for the first time, her positive attitude contrasts starkly with her gloomy, intolerant and cynical driving instructor, Scott. He is emotionally repressed, has anger problems and becomes extremely agitated by Poppy's casual attitude towards driving. As Poppy gets to know him, it becomes evident that Scott believes in conspiracy theories. His beliefs are partly attributable to his racist and misogynistic views, which make it hard for him to get along with others. Scott seems to be angered by Poppy's sunny personality and what he perceives as a lack of responsibility and concern for driving safety. Scott is exceptionally irritated by Poppy's choice of footwear (a pair of high-heeled boots), which he feels compromises her ability to drive. From the outset he feels Poppy does not take her lessons seriously and is careless.
Poppy, however, does have the capacity to be responsible. At school Poppy observes one of her pupils bullying one of his classmates. Rather than becoming angry, she worries about him and takes the appropriate action. After speaking with her student, she comes to the correct conclusion that her student is being abused at home. A social worker, Tim, is brought in to handle the boy's case. Through Tim and the pupil's interactions, the latter reveals that his mother's boyfriend has been beating him. Tim and Poppy begin dating.
Poppy, Zoe, and Poppy's younger sister, Suzy, go to visit another sister, Helen, who lives with her husband in Southend-on-Sea and is pregnant. Helen proves to be a very judgemental person and tells Poppy she needs to ""take life seriously"", ""not get drunk every night"" and plan for the future. Poppy responds that she is happy with her life as it is. Helen tries to convince Poppy to be more responsible, condescendingly telling her she's too childish, but is ultimately ignored.
Returning home, Poppy sees Scott standing across the street from her flat, and when she calls his name he runs away. When she confronts him he insists he had been visiting his mother in Stevenage at the time she saw him. Scott drives erratically while ranting against other drivers and society. When he gives Poppy the keys to his car, she tells him he is in no condition to give a driving lesson and she will drive him home. Scott tries to get his keys back and physically attacks Poppy. She manages to escape his grasp, then in a long, rambling diatribe Scott accuses Poppy of trying to seduce him, revealing his romantic feelings for her. Unable to reason with him, Poppy waits until he has calmed down then gives the keys back, telling him the lesson will be their last.
The film ends with Poppy and Zoe rowing a boat in Regent's Park, as Poppy takes a mobile phone call from Tim, and Zoe advises Poppy to think about ""giving up being nice to everyone."" Poppy dismisses the advice, cheerfully but not naively.","sentimental,sincere,witty,humorous,feel good,clever,bittersweet,captivating",3664.jpg,2008-04-18, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/happy-go-lucky/id432513101?uo=4,WILfr1Q4a8M,70105126,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Happy-Go-Lucky/70105126,"Art House & International,Comedy,Drama"
1523,Hard Times,"A depression era street fighter joins with a promoter of no-holds-barred street boxing bouts in New Orleans. In the depression, Chaney, a strong silent streetfighter, joins with Speed, a promoter of no-holds-barred street boxing bouts. They go to New Orleans where Speed borrows money to set up fights for Chaney, but Speed gambles away any winnings. ","Chaney (Charles Bronson), a mysterious, down-on-his luck drifter during the Great Depression, arrives in town in the boxcar of a freight train. He comes upon a bare-knuckled street fight run by gamblers. After the bout, he follows one of the fight's organizers, the fast-talking ""Speed"" (James Coburn). Chaney asks Speed to set up a fight. Betting his few dollars on himself, Chaney wins with a single punch.
Speed wants to become Chaney's manager. They travel to New Orleans, where Speed intends to enter Chaney against local fighters at long odds. Chaney takes a cheap sleeping room. At a diner, he meets Lucy Simpson (Jill Ireland), a lonely woman whose husband is in prison. They begin an uneasy affair.
Chaney cautions Speed that he wants to make a little money to ""fill a few in-betweens,"" and then move on. Speed recruits a cutman, the medical school dropout Poe (Strother Martin). An opium addict - ""a dyed in the wool hophead"", Poe is relieved when Chaney accepts him.
Speed plans for Chaney to take on the city's undefeated street fighter Jim Henry (Robert Tessier), an intimidating brawler bankrolled by wealthy businessman Chick Gandil (Michael McGuire). Gandil suspects a setup, so he insists Speed bet $3,000 up front. Speed is forced to obtain a loan from local mobsters. Chaney takes on Jim Henry and proves up to the task, knocking him out.
The trio of Chaney, Speed and Poe celebrate at a juke joint with their lady friends. Speed gets into a dice game and gambles away his share of the winnings. The mobsters stalk Speed because of the money he owes.
Gandil offers money so Chaney will fight for him. Speed is willing because it will square his debts, but Chaney refuses. He and Speed have a bitter argument. Lucy also splits with Chaney because of his emotional distance and lack of commitment.
Gandil decides to hire Street (Nick Dimitri), a black leather coat wearing, top street fighter from Chicago. He fails to draw Chaney into a winner-take-all bout, so he pays off Speed's debt and takes him hostage. If there is no fight, Speed will be killed for the money he owes.
Poe visits Chaney at his apartment and tells him the trouble Speed is in. Chaney comes to Gandil's warehouse where the fight will take place. Not only is he forced to fight for Speed's life, but must risk all of his own winnings. Street is his toughest opponent and the two knock each other down, but eventually Chaney gets the upper hand and wins a grueling bout. Speed's life is spared.
True to his word, Chaney decides the time has come to move on. He gives Speed and Poe a generous amount of the money and walks alone towards the railroad tracks. As he disappears into darkness, Speed says, ""He sure was something.""
This film is highly allegorical both in the characters and story. As Poe stated ""some are born to fail, others have it thrust upon them"". Chaney - strong in character and commitment, daunting and invincible. Speed, a huckster, inveterate gambler, weak in character and commitment and Poe, a philosopher, addict and failure with a sense of Chaney's strength. A remarkable first effort by Hill.","exciting,rough,atmospheric,suspenseful",1523.jpg,1975-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hard-times/id322202346?uo=4,u1N0s4n5blA,,,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Drama"

Kumar buys marijuana from a student named Bradley (Dov Tiefenbach) while Harold deals with the attention of Korean students admirable of his job. After smoking more marijuana together, Harold and Kumar are discovered by a campus security guard and forced to flee, losing their bag of marijuana.

Spotting the White Castle below, Harold and Kumar use a hang glider from the truck to reach their destination. The pair place their orders but find they have no money. Harris appears, apologizes for his actions and provides them with cash for their meal and for repairs to Harold's car.
Kumar realizes he wants to be a doctor, but is afraid of conforming to the stereotype of Indians becoming doctors.

Self-destructive and needy but wealthy teenager Harold is obsessed with death and spends his leisure time attending funerals, watching the demolition of buildings, visiting junkyards, simulating suicides trying to get the attention of his indifferent, snobbish and egocentric mother, and having sessions with his psychologist. When Harold meets the anarchic seventy-nine-year-old Maude at a funeral, they become friends and the old lady discloses other perspectives of the cycle of life for him. Meanwhile, his mother enlists him in a dating service and tries to force him to join the army. On the day of Maude's eightieth birthday, Harold proposes to her but he finds the truth about life at the end of hers.
","Harold Chasen (Bud Cort) is a young man obsessed with death. He regularly stages elaborate fake suicides, attends funerals, and drives a hearse, all to the chagrin of his mother, socialite Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles).[6]
At a funeral service for a total stranger, Harold meets Maude (Ruth Gordon), a 79-year-old woman who shares Harold's hobby of attending funerals. He is entranced by her quirky outlook on life, which is bright and excessively carefree in contrast with his own morbidity. The pair form a bond, and Maude slowly shows Harold the pleasures of art and music (Harold is taught to play banjo), and teaches him how to ""[make] the most of his time on earth"".[6] Meanwhile, Harold's mother determines, much against Harold's wishes, to find him a wife to settle down with. One by one, Harold frightens and horrifies each of his appointed dates by appearing to commit gruesome acts such as self-immolation, self-mutilation, and seppuku.
As they become closer, Harold announces that he will marry Maude, resulting in disgusted outbursts from his family, psychiatrist and priest. Maude's 80th birthday arrives, and Harold throws a surprise party for her. As the couple dances, Maude tells Harold that she ""couldn't imagine a lovelier farewell"". He immediately questions Maude as to her meaning, and she reveals that she has purposely taken an overdose of sleeping pills and will be dead by midnight. She restates her firm belief that 80 is the proper age to die.
Harold rushes Maude to the hospital, where she is treated unsuccessfully and dies. In the final sequence, Harold's car is seen going off a seaside cliff, but after the crash, the final shot reveals Harold standing calmly atop the cliff, holding his banjo.

136,Harry Brown,"A modest law-abiding citizen, Harry Brown (Michael Caine) is a retired Marine and a widower who lives alone in a depressed housing estate. His only company is his best friend Leonard (David Bradley). When Leonard is murdered by a gang of thugs, Harry feels compelled to act and is forced to dispense his own brand of justice. As he bids to clean up the run-down estate where he lives, his actions bring him into conflict with the police, led by investigating officer DCI Frampton (Emily Mortimer) and Charlie Creed-Miles.","Harold ""Harry"" Brown, an elderly former Royal Marine currently living in a council estate ruled by violent gangs, spends most of his time playing chess with his best friend, Leonard ""Len"" Attwell and visiting his hospitalised and comatose wife, Katherine, who suddenly dies from complications. Harry is late to see her before she dies because he is too scared to take the quicker underpass route, where a gang resides.
After her funeral, Len confides in Harry that he is being terrorised by some youths and shows Harry an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself, citing that the police would not help him and he plans on taking justice into his own hands. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terence ""Terry"" Hicock, who tell him that Len had been murdered by a local gang led by Noel Winters. After Len's funeral, Harry is held at knife-point by Dean Saunders, an addict and suspect in Len's murder, whom he stabs in self defence during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry again the following morning and informs him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges laid could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defence.
Harry decides to take matters into his own hands; he follows a drug dealer named Kenny to a squalid den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch are also growing cannabis and are sexually abusing a currently overdosing girl to make pornography. When Harry suggests calling an ambulance for the girl, Stretch threatens Harry, and he kills the dealers in retaliation, before burning down their den and leaving with the girl and some firearms.
After leaving the girl outside a hospital, Harry captures one of Noel's gang members named Marky, who is being sexually abused by Troy Martindale, a heroin kingpin. Harry shoots and kills Martindale and captures Marky, whom he tortures into revealing some mobile phone camera footage of Len's murder, proving the gang's aggressive involvement. Harry uses Marky to bait Noel and Carl, another gang member, into a gunfight in the underpass. Carl is killed by Harry, and Marky is killed in the crossfire between Harry and Noel. After Marky is killed, Noel flees the underpass, with Harry in pursuit, before Harry collapses due to an emphysema attack.
Convinced that the recent gang deaths are related to a gang war rather than Harry, Police Superintendent Childs orders a major arrest operation on the estate, which then leads to a massive riot. Harry discharges himself from hospital to pursue Noel, which results in Frampton and Hicock being in a car crash when they attempt to stop him. Harry rescues them and takes them to a nearby pub, where Frampton warns Harry that Sidney ""Sid"" Rourke, the bartender, is actually Noel's uncle. Harry discovers that Sid had been hiding Noel, but his guard drops due to his emphysema, allowing Sid to take the gun and reveal that he plans on killing Harry and the officers to protect Noel. Frampton tries to call for backup, only to be stopped midway by Noel, who is told to strangle her after Sid suffocates an unconscious Hicock. After Harry draws a revolver and shoots Noel, Sid shoots and wounds Harry, only to be shot by Frampton's backup in the form of police snipers, which had picked up on her interrupted call.
At a conference held after the riot, Superintendent Childs announces that Frampton and the late Hicock will be given medals for their work and sacrifice, and denies any evidence of vigilante involvement in the entire case, saying that any such suggestions are unhelpful. The final scene is of a recovered Harry walking towards the underpass, now free and safe to walk through.","rough,bleak,suspenseful,atmospheric,gloomy,tense",136.jpg,2009-09-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/harry-brown/id385147428?uo=4,I2S3SraFmI0,70117310,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Harry_Brown/70117310,"Art House & International,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts is about to start and he is enjoying the summer vacation with his friends. They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death Eaters' set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire. On the night of selection, however, the Goblet spews out four names instead of the usual three, with Harry unwittingly being selected as the Fourth Champion. Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.","Now 14 years old, Harry Potter dreams of an elderly man, Frank Bryce, who is killed after overhearing Lord Voldemort discussing plans with Peter ""Wormtail"" Pettigrew and Barty Crouch Jr. The Quidditch World Cup allows Harry to take his mind off his nightmares until followers of Voldemort known as Death Eaters terrorise the spectators' campsites after the match, and Crouch Jr. summons the Dark Mark, a sign showing that Voldemort is returning to power.
At Hogwarts, headmaster Albus Dumbledore introduces ex-Auror Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody as the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher. In their first Defence Against the Dark Arts lesson, the students learn of the three Unforgivable Curses. The Imperius Curse causes absence of free will, the Cruciatus Curse causes unbearable pain, and the final curse, Avada Kedavra, causes death. Dumbledore announces that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates' names are placed. Fred and George attempt to enter using an aging potion as no one under 17 can enter. This fails miserably. Cedric Diggory, a student from the House of Hufflepuff, is chosen to represent Hogwarts, Viktor Krum is chosen to represent Durmstrang Institute, and Fleur Delacour is selected to represent Beauxbatons Academy of Magic. The Goblet unexpectedly chooses a fourth champion: Harry. As Harry is underage and should have been ineligible to compete, Hogwarts teachers and students grow suspicious, and the feat drives Ron and Harry apart. The teachers want Dumbledore to pull Harry out of the tournament, but the four champions are bound by a magical contract and therefore Dumbledore has no choice and Harry must compete.
For the first task of the Triwizard Tournament, each of the champions must retrieve a golden egg guarded by a dragon. Mad-Eye advises Harry to use his talent for flying to overcome the dragon. Harry enters the first task and summons his broomstick to retrieve the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. The students are soon informed of the Yule Ball, a Christmas Eve ball held during the Triwizard Tournament. Ron and Harry have trouble finding dates to the ball and when they find out that Hermione is attending with Viktor Krum, Ron becomes jealous.
In exchange for previous aid, Cedric provides Harry with a clue that prompts him to open the egg underwater. With help from Moaning Myrtle, he learns that the second task entails the retrieval of ""something precious"" to each of the competitors from the nearby Black Lake, where there are mermaids. While preparing for the task, Neville Longbottom provides Harry with Gillyweed, enabling him to breathe underwater for one hour. Harry is the first to arrive at the location, and finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang and Fleur's sister, Gabrielle, in suspended animation. Finishing last after attempting to free Ron and Gabrielle, Harry is awarded second place for ""outstanding moral fiber"", behind Cedric.
Following an exchange with Mad-Eye, Ministry official Barty Crouch, Sr. is found dead by Harry shortly after the second task. While waiting in Dumbledore's office, Harry's curiosity leads him to look into Dumbledore's pensieve, causing him to revisit one of Dumbledore's memories. He witnesses a trial before the Wizengamot in which captured Death Eater Igor Karkaroff, the current headmaster of Durmstrang, denounces a number of Death Eaters, including both Severus Snape and Barty Crouch Jr. While Dumbledore vouches for Snape's integrity, Crouch Sr. is horrified at this revelation and disowns his maniacal son, sending him to Azkaban. Upon returning to the present time, Dumbledore tells Harry that he is searching his memories for a clue as to why extraordinary events have taken place at Hogwarts since the start of the tournament.
In the Triwizard Tournament's third and final task, the competitors are placed inside a hedge maze; their challenge is to reach the Triwizard Cup. Krum, acting under the Imperius curse, incapacitates Fleur and attempts to do the same to Cedric. Harry stops Cedric from attacking Krum, and the two run for the cup. When Cedric is trapped by vines, Harry frees him and the two claim a draw and grab hold of the cup together.
The cup, which is a Portkey, transports the two champions to a graveyard where Wormtail and Voldemort are waiting for Harry. Wormtail murders Cedric, traps Harry, then performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters (which includes Draco's father, Lucius) and bids them to witness a duel between their Dark Lord and his nemesis. As Harry, who is tortured by Voldemort, fights him, a connection called Priori Incantatem occurs between their wands. Harry's wand forces Voldemort's to disgorge the spirits of the people Voldemort has most recently murdered, including Harry's parents, Frank Bryce and Cedric. Harry is briefly protected by the spirits and escapes with Cedric's body (as his request) using the cup.
Upon his return, Harry tells Dumbledore and Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge that Voldemort has returned and is responsible for Cedric's death. Mad-Eye leads a devastated Harry back to the castle, where his questions make Harry suspicious. Mad-Eye reveals it was he who put Harry's name in the Goblet, assisted Cedric and Neville in helping Harry, cursed Krum and so on. Dumbledore, Snape and McGonagall arrive and force Veritaserum, a truth-telling potion down Mad-Eye's throat. He reveals he is not Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody and the real one is imprisoned in a magical trunk minus his magical eye and fake leg. The false Mad-Eye's Polyjuice Potion (Snape earlier accused Harry of stealing ingredients) wears off and he is revealed as Barty Crouch Jr., who shows a pulsing Dark Mark tattoo on his forearm meaning Voldemort's returned.
Soon after, students and staff of Hogwarts, Durmstrang and Beauxbatons gather in the Great Hall to say farewell to Cedric. Dumbledore exhorts them to stand together against Voldemort, as the representatives from Durmstrang and Beauxbatons leave Hogwarts.","squint,glasses,anticipation,fear",1843.jpg,2005-11-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/harry-potter-goblet-fire/id285832716?uo=4,,70021660,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Harry_Potter_and_the_Goblet_of_Fire/70021660,"Action & Adventure,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
302,Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince,"As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously ""This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince"" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.
","Harry is shown bleeding in front of the Ministry of Magic, as the result of an attack that took place after the second-to-last scene of the previous film, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Lord Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Wizarding and Muggle worlds and has chosen Draco Malfoy to carry out a secret mission. Severus Snape accepts Bellatrix Lestrange's challenge to make an Unbreakable Vow with Draco's mother, Narcissa, to protect Draco and fulfill the assignment if he fails.
Harry, now 16 years old accompanies Albus Dumbledore to visit former potions professor Horace Slughorn, who has gone into hiding. Slughorn agrees to return to teach at Hogwarts as Dumbledore tells Harry that Slughorn's return to Hogwarts is crucial. Leaving Fred and George's new shop, Harry, Ron and Hermione notice Draco and Narcissa associating with Death Eaters in Borgin and Burkes. Harry believes Voldemort has made Draco a Death Eater, but Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry spies on Draco, who hints to his friends that he does not plan to return to Hogwarts next year. Draco discovers Harry's presence and immobilises him, but Harry is rescued by Luna with her Spectrespecs.
At Hogwarts, Harry and Ron are admitted to Slughorn's Potions class at the last minute and have to borrow the needed textbooks because they don't have their own. Harry's copy is inscribed on the fly page by the ""Half-Blood Prince"". This owner, Harry finds, had annotated the book with additional instructions‚Äö√Ñ√Ætips and recommendations that allow Harry to excel in the class. As for Ron, he becomes the Keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Thinking he has been given a good luck potion by Harry, Ron becomes a sports hero and partially as a result, forms a romantic relationship with Lavender Brown, leaving Hermione disconsolate. Harry discovers Hermione sobbing in the Astronomy Tower, where he reveals to her that he has feelings for Ron's sister, Ginny Weasley.
Harry spends Christmas with the Weasleys and becomes closer to Ginny. They almost share a kiss on Christmas Eve but Bellatrix and Fenrir Greyback, intent on capturing Harry, attack and burn the Burrow, home of the Weasleys. Outnumbered, Bellatrix and Greyback abandon their attack as Order members Nymphadora Tonks and Remus Lupin, together with Harry and the Weasleys, watch the structure burn.
After being cured of a love potion meant for Harry, Ron is nearly killed by a drink originally intended for Dumbledore. While recovering, Ron murmurs Hermione's name in the hospital, in front of both Hermione and Lavender. Suspecting that Draco was responsible for two attempts on Dumbledore's life, one of which has almost killed Ron, Harry confronts Draco and severely injures him with a Sectumsempra curse taken from the textbook of the Half-Blood Prince. Harry, shocked that the curse has sliced open Draco's chest, retreats as Severus Snape enters and magically heals Draco's wound. Fearing the book may be filled with more Dark Magic, Ginny and Harry hide it in the Room of Requirement and, while doing so, share their first kiss.
Dumbledore shows Harry memories of a young Tom Riddle and reveals that Slughorn retains a memory critical to Voldemort's defeat. Harry retrieves the memory, learning that Voldemort wanted information for creating seven Horcruxes. The Horcrux safeguards a portion of the creator's soul, granting him immortality unless the Horcrux is destroyed. Two of Voldemort's Horcruxes have already been destroyed: Tom Riddle's diary and Marvolo Gaunt's ring. Touching the ring, Harry has a vision of Voldemort, which Dumbledore notices. After discovering the possible location of another Horcrux, Dumbledore requests Harry's help to retrieve it. They travel to a far-away cave where Harry is forced to make Dumbledore drink a mind-altering potion that hides the Horcrux, a locket. A weakened Dumbledore defends them from a horde of Inferi and Apparates himself and Harry back to the Astronomy Tower at Hogwarts. In the meantime, Bellatrix, Greyback and several other Death Eaters enter the castle with Draco's help.
Upon arriving at the tower, Dumbledore tells Harry to fetch Snape but as footsteps approach, he orders Harry to hide. Draco reveals that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill Dumbledore, but he is unable to follow through. Snape arrives and casts the Avada Kedavra curse, killing Dumbledore. As Bellatrix casts the Dark Mark, Snape, Draco and the Death Eaters escape from the castle. Bellatrix destroys the Great Hall and sets fire to Hagrid's hut as Harry attempts to stop them. Snape overpowers Harry and reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince before escaping. Harry returns to the school to find the staff and students mourning Dumbledore. Led by Minerva McGonagall, the students and teachers destroy the Dark Mark to honour Dumbledore whereupon Harry is comforted by Ginny.
Harry later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from an ""R.A.B."" to Voldemort stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. His dying wish is that when Voldemort meets his match he will be mortal once more. Rather than return for their final year at Hogwarts, Harry, Ron and Hermione vow to seek out who R.A.B. was and to find the remaining Horcruxes.","fairy tale,immortality,railway station,joy,dragon,scar,boy with glasses,unicorn,wizard,mother son relationship,dining hall,teachers,mystic,fantasy,sorcery,witch,centaur,chess board,potion,invisibility,anticipation,snowy owl,spell,elf,schoolgirl,students,based on novel,broomstick,witchcraft,sorcerer,destiny,boarding school,goblin,magic,invisibility cloak,supernatural,occult,troll,locomotive,owl,escher stairway,bravery,good versus evil,child hero,magic wand,fear",302.jpg,2009-07-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/harry-potter-half-blood-prince/id326568786?uo=4,,70099612,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Harry_Potter_and_the_Half-Blood_Prince/70099612,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Kids & Family,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
1200,Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix,"After a lonely summer on Privet Drive, Harry returns to a Hogwarts full of ill-fortune. Few of students and parents believe him or Dumbledore that Voldemort is really back. The ministry had decided to step in by appointing a new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher that proves to be the nastiest person Harry has ever encountered. Harry also can't help stealing glances with the beautiful Cho Chang. To top it off are dreams that Harry can't explain, and a mystery behind something Voldemort is searching for. With these many things Harry begins one of his toughest years at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. ","The Order of the Phoenix, a secret organisation founded by Albus Dumbledore, inform the now 15-year-old Harry Potter that the Ministry of Magic is in denial of Lord Voldemort's return; under the Ministry's influence, The Daily Prophet has launched a smear campaign against Harry and Dumbledore due to Harry's supposed encounter with Voldemort at the end of the previous year. This encounter has had a huge psychological effect on Harry ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ he has nightmares not only about what happened in the graveyard but also about the Department of Mysteries at the Ministry of Magic. While at the Order's headquarters, 12 Grimmauld Place, Harry's godfather, Sirius Black, mentions that Voldemort is after an object which he didn't have last time.
Upon arrival at Hogwarts, Harry learns that Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge has appointed a new Defence Against the Dark Arts professor: Dolores Umbridge, a senior Ministry official who refuses to teach practical magic due to her belief that Dumbledore is forming a rebellion against the Ministry. Umbridge and Harry immediately clash, as she refuses to believe that Voldemort has returned and forces Harry to carve 'I must not tell lies' into the skin on the back of his hand through a cursed quill. When Ron and Hermione notice these scars, they are outraged but Harry refuses to go to Dumbledore as he has distanced himself from him since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Ron and Hermione aid Harry in forming a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves ""Dumbledore's Army"". The Slytherin students are recruited by Umbridge to uncover the group. Meanwhile, Harry and Cho Chang develop romantic feelings for each other and begin a relationship during Christmas, Cho being Harry's first kiss at the last DA meeting before the holidays. However, Harry discovers that his behaviour is becoming erratic and possibly more similar to Voldemort's.
Harry has a vision involving an attack upon Arthur Weasley in the Department of Mysteries, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Fearing Voldemort will exploit his connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs Professor Snape to give Harry Occlumency lessons to block his mind from Voldemort's influence. These lessons increase Harry's psychological problems, as he is forced to relive everything bad that has ever happened to him. During one lesson, Harry got annoyed at what he saw and requested a break but Snape refused and forced Harry to continue the lesson. This only got the spell reversed on him by Harry where Harry sees the Vision on why Snape hates his father, James, who often had bullied him. The connection between Harry and Voldemort leads Harry to distance himself from everyone, and he pushes not only Ron and Hermione but Ginny, Neville, the Weasley twins and Luna away, as he feels ""so angry all the time"". Bellatrix Lestrange, Sirius' deranged cousin, escapes from Azkaban along with nine other Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her Inquisitorial Squad uncover Dumbledore's Army after illegally interrogating Cho with Veritaserum. Dumbledore covers up for Harry, but escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. With Dumbledore gone, Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress. Harry's relationship with Cho falls apart, mostly due to Cho having betrayed Dumbledore's Army to Umbridge (unknown to Harry, however, is that Cho was under the influence of Veritaserum, a truth potion).
During an O.W.L. exam, the Weasley twins revolt and set off fireworks in the Great Hall, causing chaos for Umbridge. During this event, Harry has a vision of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort within the Department of Mysteries. Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network, since it is the only one not being monitored, but Umbridge stops them before they can do so. When she threatens to use the Cruciatus Curse to get information out of Harry about the trio's intentions, Hermione deceives Umbridge into entering the Forbidden Forest in search for Dumbledore's ""secret weapon"". She and Harry lead her to the hiding place of Hagrid's half-giant brother, Grawp, only to be confronted by centaurs who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks them. When Umbridge tells Harry to make the centaurs let her go and that she means no harm Harry says, ""Sorry, Professor. I must not tell lies"". Harry, Hermione, Ron, Luna, Neville and Ginny fly to the Ministry of Magic on Thestrals in an attempt to save Sirius.
The six enter the Department of Mysteries where they uncover a prophecy involving Harry and Voldemort, the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters including Lucius Malfoy and Bellatrix Lestrange. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured; it was not an actual situation, rather a method to lure Harry into the Death Eater's grasp. Lucius attempts to persuade Harry to give him the prophecy, telling him it will reveal why Voldemort could not kill Harry when he was an infant. Harry refuses and a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters ensues. The Death Eaters take everyone except Harry as hostages, threatening to kill them if he does not surrender the prophecy. Harry obliges just as Sirius and Remus Lupin arrive with Order members Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley Shacklebolt and Mad-Eye Moody. They attack the Death Eaters and Lucius drops the prophecy, destroying it. Harry and Sirius duel him. Just as Sirius defeats Lucius, Bellatrix kills Sirius. Despite Remus trying to hold him back, Harry goes after Bellatrix, who runs away continuously saying ""I killed Sirius Black"" in a song-like manner. Harry chases and corners Bellatrix in the Atrium and attempts to perform the Cruciatus Curse on her, but to little avail (it knocks her down). Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before Voldemort can kill Harry.
A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues while Bellatrix escapes. After the two prove evenly matched, Voldemort possesses Harry in order to try to get Dumbledore to sacrifice Harry in the hope of killing him, but the love Harry feels for his friends and Sirius makes it impossible for Voldemort to remain in his body. Ministry officials arrive before Voldemort disapparates; Fudge is forced to admit that Voldemort has returned and resigns as Minister. Dumbledore returns as headmaster of Hogwarts after he and Harry are vindicated. Dumbledore explains that he distanced himself from Harry all year hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection. Harry comes to terms with the prophecy; ""Neither can live while the other survives."" As Harry and his friends head towards the Hogwarts Express, Harry tells his friends that even though a war is beginning, unlike Voldemort, they have something worth fighting for.",,1200.jpg,2007-06-28, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/harry-potter-order-phoenix/id273696792?uo=4,,70058027,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Harry_Potter_and_the_Order_of_the_Phoenix/70058027,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
2654,Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"It's Harry's third year at Hogwarts; not only does he have a new ""Defense Against the Dark Arts"" teacher, but there is also trouble brewing. Convicted murderer Sirius Black has escaped the Wizards' Prison and is coming after Harry. Harry Potter is having a tough time with his relatives (yet again). He runs away after using magic to inflate Uncle Vernon's sister Marge who was being offensive towards Harry's parents. Initially scared for using magic outside the school, he is pleasantly surprised that he won't be penalized after all. However, he soon learns that a dangerous criminal and Voldemort's trusted aide Sirius Black has escaped from the Azkaban prison and wants to kill Harry to avenge the Dark Lord. To worsen the conditions for Harry, vile creatures called Dementors are appointed to guard the school gates and inexplicably happen to have the most horrible effect on him. Little does Harry know that by the end of this year, many holes in his past (whatever he knows of it) will be filled up and he will have a clearer vision of what the future has in store.","Now 13 years old, Harry Potter has been spending the summer at Privet Drive, absorbing most of his time studying new spells. When Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge, comes for a visit and infuriates Harry by insulting his parents, he loses his temper and accidentally causes her to inflate and fly away. Harry then threatens to curse Vernon when he tries to discipline him but flees, fed up with his life at Privet Drive. Shortly after seeing a large black dog watching him, the Knight Bus appears and delivers Harry to the Leaky Cauldron, where Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge tells him he will not be arrested for the use of magic on his aunt. After reuniting with Ron, and Hermione, Harry learns that Sirius Black, a convicted supporter of Lord Voldemort, has escaped Azkaban prison and is likely intending to kill Harry.
Harry, Ron and Hermione head back to school on the Hogwarts Express. They unknowingly share a compartment with the new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher, Remus Lupin, who is sleeping. When the train abruptly stops, Dementors board, searching for Black because Harry mentioned his name. One of the Dementors enters their compartment, prompting Harry to pass out whilst under the impression of a woman screaming. At this time, Lupin awakes and repels the Dementor with a Patronus Charm.
At Hogwarts, Albus Dumbledore informs students that the Dementors will be guarding the school while Black is at large. Professor Lupin is introduced, and Hagrid is announced as the new Care of Magical Creatures teacher. Lupin's lessons prove enjoyable; he focuses on practice, not just theory, and encourages less confident students such as Neville when he faces a boggart in the form of his worst fear, Professor Snape. However, Hagrid's first class goes awry when Draco Malfoy deliberately provokes the Hippogriff, Buckbeak, who then attacks him. Draco's father Lucius Malfoy has Buckbeak sentenced to death on court.
Later the trio find a crowd at the door to their dormitory, and The Fat Lady missing from her portrait. She is located in a different picture, and she tells Dumbledore that Black has entered the castle. Filch, Lupin and Snape secure and search the castle, but they find no one. As the Gryffindor Dormitory has been compromised, the students sleep in the main hall which allows Harry to overhear an argument between Snape and Dumbledore about Lupin's suspected role.
During a stormy Quidditch match, several Dementors approach and overpower Harry, causing him to fall off his broomstick, which is then destroyed by the Whomping Willow. Lupin secretly teaches Harry to defend himself against Dementors using the Patronus charm. As Harry lacks parental permission to visit Hogsmeade, Fred and George (who intercept him despite his invisible cloak due to his footprints in the snow) give him their Marauder's Map, a magical document showing every person's location within Hogwarts, as well as secret passageways in and out of the school castle. At Hogsmeade, Harry notices Fudge and Madam Rosmerta, discussing Black. He follows them after he hears mentioning his name, and overhears that Black is his godfather and was his parents' best friend. Black was accused of divulging the Potters' secret whereabouts to Voldemort and murdering their mutual friend Peter Pettigrew by blowing him up. Out of anger, Harry vows to avenge his parents, and kill Black.
Late at night, Harry is reading the Marauder's map, when he notices Peter Pettigrew's name on it. He exits the dormitory and follows him. He follows Pettigrew, on the map, but is unable to see him anywhere. He instead sees Snape on the map, but fails to avoid him. Snape initially confiscates the map, but hands it over to Lupin who arrives to take Harry to his classroom, keeping the map and admonishing Harry for wandering the castle while Black is at large. Before leaving, Harry mentions to Lupin seeing Pettigrew on the map, leaving Lupin astonished.
After a class of Divination, Professor Trelawney enters a trance and predicts that the Dark Lord's servant will return that night. Later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione visit Hagrid to console him over Buckbeak's impending execution. While there, they discover Scabbers, Ron's missing rat. Fudge, Dumbledore, and an executioner arrive at Hagrid's to carry out Buckbeak's execution, and the three students hurry away to avoid being discovered. Scabbers suddenly bites Ron, escaping, and as the trio chase him a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the Whomping Willow's base. Harry and Hermione are attacked by the tree but also manage to enter the underground passage to the Shrieking Shack.
There they discover that the dog is actually Sirius Black, who is an Animagus. Harry attacks Black, but Lupin arrives and disarms Harry. After exchanging a few cryptic words with Black, Lupin then embraces him as an old friend. When confronted by Hermione, Lupin admits to being a werewolf, and he and Black begin to explain that Black is innocent. Professor Snape bursts in, intending to hand over Black to the Dementors, but Harry, having doubts, knocks him out with a spell. Lupin and Black explain that Scabbers is actually Peter Pettigrew, an Animagus who committed the crime for which Black was convicted.
Lupin and Black force Pettigrew back into his human form preparing to kill him, but Harry intervenes saying that his father would not have wanted his two best friends to become killers. Pettigrew is instead to be turned over to the Dementors. As the group heads to the castle, the full moon rises; Lupin transforms into a werewolf, and Pettigrew manages to escape in the confusion. Lupin and Black fight in their animal forms, until Lupin is distracted by another animal's howls. Dementors attack Black and Harry. As Dementors are preparing to suck out their souls and perform the Dementor's Kiss, Harry sees a distant figure cast a powerful stag-shaped Patronus that scatters the Dementors, and sends them away. Harry believes the mysterious figure is his dead father.
Harry passes out from the trauma, and awakens to find he is in Hogwarts and Sirius has been captured. Acting on advice from Dumbledore, Hermione reveals that she possesses a time-turner that she has used all year to take multiple classes simultaneously. She and Harry travel back in time three hours, watching themselves repeat that night's events. They free Buckbeak, and return to the Whomping Willow. As the Dementors overpower Black and his earlier self, Harry realises that he himself was the one to cast the Patronus, and rushes to do so. Harry and Hermione then rescue Black, who escapes on Buckbeak, commenting that they are both now fugitives. Lupin resigns the next day, knowing that parents will object to a werewolf teaching their children. Shortly after, Black anonymously sends Harry a Firebolt, the fastest racing broom ever made.",,2654.jpg,2004-06-04, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/harry-potter-prisoner-azkaban/id285825306?uo=4,,60034567,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Harry_Potter_and_the_Prisoner_of_Azkaban/60034567,"Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

In attempting to meet Conor at a bar, she befriends the bar owner Alex (Justin Long) who reveals the strategies men use to avoid a woman. He explains that if a man is interested in a woman, he will overcome any obstacles to ensure they date again, and that Gigi has been misinterpreting and obsessing over imagined ""signs"" she receives from men. This friendship continues and Gigi interprets his eagerness to always assist, such as taking Gigi's call while he is on a date, as a sign that he is interested in her. She eventually makes a move but Alex claims he is not interested in her romantically.
Gigi has moved on from Alex, no longer desperately trying to construct evidence the man is interested in her. However, in a role reversal, Alex began mooning over Gigi. After leaving several unanswered messages Alex arrives at Gigi's apartment to declare his love. They kiss and start dating.
[edit]Janine, Ben, and Anna
Gigi's friend and co-worker Janine (Jennifer Connelly) is having difficulties in her marriage to Ben (Bradley Cooper). As Janine obsesses on their home renovations, Ben becomes attracted to Anna (Scarlett Johansson), a yoga instructor and aspiring singer, and the feeling is mutual. Ben and Anna pursue a flirtatious friendship under the pretense of him helping her establish a singing career. Ben reveals to Anna that Janine coerced him into marriage by threatening to leave if he didn't propose.
Fervently anti-smoking (due to her father's death from lung cancer), Janine pointedly asks Ben if he has been smoking, and later is perturbed to find cigarette butts hidden in the back yard of the house. Ben insists they are not his. Their contractor Javier, aggressively interrogated by Janine, says none of his workers smoke at the house. During a tense shopping trip to select flooring, Ben reveals to Janine that he has cheated on her. Janine is devastated but rationalizes Ben's behavior, blaming herself for being too cold in the relationship, and declares she wants to save their marriage.
After a positive meeting about her singing career, Anna begins to have sex with Ben in his office. They are interrupted by Janine who, hoping to spice up their marriage, has arrived unexpectedly. Anna hides in a closet and Ben attempts to send Janine away. But she makes a heartfelt plea to save their marriage, and there are indications she succeeds in seducing him. After Janine leaves Anna angrily departs vowing to cut ties with Ben. As Janine tidies up Ben's clothes back at their newly completed house, fully satisfied to make it a home, she discovers a fresh pack of cigarettes in a pocket. She explodes in anger. When Ben arrives home he finds his clothes neatly folded with a whole carton of cigarettes and a note attached from Janine asking for a divorce. Janine moves into a new apartment by herself to start a new life. Anna is later seen performing at an upscale nightclub. Ben is alone, purchasing the same beer at the same supermarket where he met Anna.
[edit]Conor, Anna, and Mary
Ben's lover Anna enjoys a close friendship with Alex's friend, real estate agent, Conor (Kevin Connolly). He is romantically interested in her, while Anna is only interested in a casual relationship with Conor. Conor misinterprets her hugs and cute nicknames for potential romantic interest.
Anna's friend, Mary (Drew Barrymore) is in ad sales for a local newspaper. She helps Conor promote his real estate business in a series of print ads. Like Gigi, she meets many men (mostly online), but despite constantly monitoring emails, pager, phone, and Myspace messages, the ""meetings"" go nowhere.
While Conor attempts to cultivate a gay clientele, two gay men tell him how he is going wrong with Anna. Taking their advice, Conor decides to declare his love to Anna. Vulnerable after falling out with Ben, Anna agrees to start a serious relationship with him. When Conor proposes buying a house and moving in together, Anna admits she doesn't want to, and they break up.
Mary later runs into Conor, recognizing him from his ad photo, and introduces herself, since they have only spoken over the phone. They hit it off, and start dating.
[edit]Beth and Neil
Gigi's other co-worker, Beth (Jennifer Aniston), is living with her boyfriend, Neil (Ben Affleck), who is also friends with Ben. After seven years together, Beth wants to get married, but Neil does not believe in marriage. With Gigi's newfound pragmatic stance on relationships after advice from Alex, she announces that she will no longer misinterpret vague gestures from men as more than they really are. This spurs Beth to confront Neil about their relationship. When he still does not want to get married, she breaks up with him.
Later, the fraught preparations for her younger sister Paige's (Brooke Bloom) wedding bring the issue into sharper focus to Beth. During the reception, her father (Kris Kristofferson) suffers a heart attack. Beth looks after him as he recuperates while her sisters sit moping and their husbands remain glued to the television. As the household falls into chaos, Neil arrives with groceries and has tidied the kitchen. The two reconcile, with Beth saying that Neil is more of a husband to her than her sisters' spouses are to them, and she will not insist they be married. Neil later proposes to her, and they marry in an intimate ceremony aboard his sailboat.",joy,1913.jpg,2009-02-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hes-just-not-that-into-you/id305114504?uo=4,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2c3rxHgfRTo,,,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"
7273,Headhunters,"Roger is a charming scoundrel and Norway's most accomplished headhunter. He lives a life of luxury well beyond his means and subsidizes his expensive lifestyle by stealing highly prized art. When his beautiful wife, an art gallery owner, introduces him to a former mercenary in possession of an extremely valuable painting, he decides to risk it all in order to obtain it, and in doing so, he discovers something that makes him a hunted man himself.","Forget Wallander and Lisbeth Salander. At the other end of the Scandi crime boom is Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), diminutive corporate headhunter and part-time art thief.  Based on a Jo Nesbo novel, Roger's misadventures rapidly transform into a bone-dry, darkly comic thriller.

Another decent art-house hit for Nordic cinema, and an attention-grabbing advert for Nesbo; his Jackpot has already been released and - inevitably - the Hollywood version of Headhunters is now being made.

In screenwriting circles, they say all of a film's work is done in the first 10 minutes. In Morten Tyldum's Norwegian box-office smash, a Coens-like thriller adapted from Jo Nesb‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚Äö√Ñ√¥'s bestselling novel, it's closer to 90 seconds. Before the credits have finished we meet recruitment consultant Roger Brown (Aksel Hennie), who moonlights as an art thief. We then see his pristine home, meet his beautiful wife (Synn‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve Macody Lund) and watch him dump his mistress (Julie R. ‚àö√°lgaard) for being too clingy.

We even learn his Achilles' heel: his 1.68m height. You don't need a shrink to realise that requires compensation, he tells us wryly or to see that his carefully constructed house of cards is about to crash down. And that's the boon of Lars Gudmestad and Ulf Ryburg's script, which manages to improve on the already impressive source material. On one hand, Brown is a poisonous Napoleon who deserves everything Tyldum throws at him: from Coster-Waldau's too-perfect (and too-tall) nemesis to car crashes, canine attacks and corporate chicanery.

On the other, his grip is so fragile, and his suffering so disproportionate (one scene, which sees him submerge himself in an extremely full outside toilet, put Hennie off coffee for a year), that we're willing him to fight back even as we're enjoying his downfall. It's a neat trick, because each new indignity (of which there are many) strips him of another veneer, bringing him closer to deserving the life he has stolen.

Nimbly directed and charmingly played by the reptilian Hennie, who can expect some international recognition (or at least to play a Bond villain), it's a film of tonal uneasiness and escalating ridiculousness, though the black humour softens the plot's unlikelier turns.

Crucially, the hurtling Action & Adventure rarely falters and never undermines the characters. And, as screenwriters will tell you, that's the holy grail.

A nice blend of Scandinavian sophistication and Hollywood slickness, Headhunters is an entertaining Nordic noir achievement and sure to be tagged as this year's The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo.

7328,Heartbeats,The story of three close friends who are involved in a love-triangle.,"Francis and Marie first meet Nicolas at a dinner party, where they both feign disinterest in him. Over the course of the next couple of the weeks, the three form a close friendship, meeting up regularly and even sleeping together in the same bed. However, it is clear that both Marie and Francis have an interest in Nicolas beyond friendship; Marie is visibly disappointed when she hopes to enjoy an intimate meal with Nicolas at a Vietnamese restaurant, only to see Francis and his friends there, and Francis is consumed by lust for Nicolas to the extent that he vigorously masturbates over the smell of Nicolas' clothes when left alone in his apartment. Both are led on by their interpretation of Nicolas' actions, such as eating a cherry from Francis' hand and telling Marie he loves them. Their feelings lead to competition between the two friends for Nicolas' affections, evidenced by their rivalry over the gifts they buy for his birthday.
The relationship culminates in a trip to stay in the vacation home of Nicolas' mother. Marie becomes jealous when Nicolas feeds Francis a marshmallow, telling him to eat it slowly like a 'striptease', and she goes to bed early. The next morning, she wakes up alone and again observes the two frolicking together from afar. She decides to leave, at which point Francis chases after her and the two end up wrestling on the ground. Nicolas is not impressed and decides to leave, saying they can love him or leave him. On returning from the trip, they don't see Nicolas, both leaving messages on his answerphone and Marie writing him a love letter. Eventually, Francis meets Nicolas and ends up pouring out his feelings, telling him he loves him and wants to kiss him. The only response from Nicolas is to ask him 'How could you think I was gay?', leaving Francis devastated. Later, Marie catches up with Nicolas in the street, and tells him about the love letter, but implies she wrote it to a female friend. From this, Nicolas comes to the conclusion that Marie has a female lover, which she denies. As Nicolas goes to leave, claiming to have left something on the stove, she tells him the truth about the letter but this makes no difference.
The film continues with Francis and Marie re-establishing their friendship and Nicolas moving away to Asia. In the final scene, they are again at a party, looking for potential lovers.",,7328.jpg,2011-05-27,,,70139532,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Heartbeats/70139532,Drama
342,Heartbreak Ridge,"A hard-nosed, hard-living Marine gunnery sergeant clashes with his superiors and his ex-wife as he takes command of a spoiled recon platoon with a bad attitude.

1983. Tom Highway is a well-decorated career military man in the United States Marine Corps, he who has seen action in Korea and Vietnam. His current rank is Gunnery Sergeant. His experiences have led him to become an opinionated, no nonsense man, who is prone to bursts of violence, especially when he's drunk, if the situation does not suit him, regardless of the specifics or people involved. Because of these actions, he has spent his fair share of overnighters behind bars. Close to retirement, one of his last assignments, one he requested, is back at his old unit at Cherry Point, North Carolina, from where he was transferred for insubordination. He is to train a reconnaissance platoon. His superior officer, the much younger and combat inexperienced Major Malcolm Powers, sees Highway as a relic of an old styled military. Highway's commanding officer, Lieutenant Ring, the platoon leader, is also a younger man who has no combat experience, but is academically inclined and happy-go-lucky. Highway finds that his team is a rag-tag bunch of slackers, who includes wannabe rock musician Stitch Jones, with who Highway had an inauspicious earlier meeting. The men in the platoon, who truly believe Highway is crazy, hate him, and don't understand why they have to follow his harsh training regimen when the United States is not currently at war. The major, who is all about efficiency regardless of combat readiness, has the same views of Highway. He is clear that he sees Highway's platoon solely as a training mechanism for his own elite squad trained by Highway's nemesis, Staff Sergeant Webster. Things for Highway and his platoon change when the United States enters into war in Grenada. Through it all, Highway tries to reconnect with his bar waitress ex-wife Aggie, he even clandestinely reading women's magazines to understand her better. Two primary obstacles stand in his way: Roy Jennings, Aggie's boss and current suitor who hates Marines, and Aggie's own remembrance of how dysfunctional their marriage was.","Gunnery Sergeant Thomas Highway (Eastwood) is nearing mandatory retirement from the Marine Corps. He finagles a transfer back to his old unit. On the bus trip to his new assignment, he meets fellow passenger ""Stitch"" Jones (Van Peebles), a flashy wannabe rock musician who steals the tip for a meal and sticks the gunny with the bill and then steals his bus ticket, leaving him stranded.
When Highway finally arrives at the base, more bad news awaits. His new Operations Officer, Major Malcolm Powers (Everett McGill), is an Annapolis graduate who transferred over from Supply and has not had ""the privilege"" of combat. He sees Highway as an anachronism in the ""new"" Marine Corps, and assigns him to shape up the reconnaissance platoon. ""Recon"" is made up of undisciplined Marines who had been allowed to slack off by their previous platoon sergeant. Among his new charges, Highway finds none other than a dismayed Corporal Stitch Jones. Highway quickly takes charge and starts the men on a rigorous training program. They make a last-ditch attempt to intimidate Highway with ""Swede"" Johanson (Peter Koch), a gigantic, heavily-muscled Marine just released from the brig, but their plan fails miserably and they eventually begin to shape up and develop esprit de corps.
Highway repeatedly clashes with Powers and Staff Sergeant Webster (Moses Gunn) over his unorthodox training methods (such as firing live ammunition from an AK-47 over his men's heads to familiarize them with the weapon's distinctive sound); Powers makes it clear that he views Highway's platoon as only a training tool for his own elite outfit. Major Powers goes so far as to script and make the Recon platoon lose in every field exercise. However, Highway is supported by his old comrade-in-arms, Sergeant Major Choozoo (Arlen Dean Snyder), and his nominal superior officer, the college educated but awkward and inexperienced Lieutenant Ring (Boyd Gaines). After Highway's men learn that he had been awarded the Medal of Honor in the Korean War, they gain respect for him and close ranks against their perceived common enemy.
Highway also has more personal problems. Aggie (Marsha Mason), his ex-wife, is working as a waitress in a local bar and dating the owner, Marine-hater Roy Jennings (Bo Svenson). Highway attempts to adapt his way of thinking enough to win Aggie back, even resorting to reading Cosmopolitan magazine to gain insights into the female mind. Initially, Aggie is bitter over their failed marriage, but tentatively reconciles with Highway. Then Highway's unit is activated for the invasion of Grenada.
After a last-minute briefing in the hangar bay of the amphibious assault ship Saipan, Highway's platoon mounts their UH-1 Huey, and are dropped by helocast into the water in advance of the rest of the Battalion Landing Team. While advancing inland, they come under heavy fire. Highway improvises, ordering Stitch Jones to use a bulldozer to provide cover so they can advance on and destroy an enemy machine gun nest. They subsequently rescue American students from a medical school. Later, when they are trapped in a building by enemy armor and infantry, radioman Profile (Tom Villard) is killed and his radio destroyed, cutting them off from direct communication. Lieutenant Ring shows previously unsuspected leadership qualities and comes up with the idea of using a telephone to make a long distance call to Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and call in air support. Later, despite Powers' explicit orders to the contrary, the men take out a key position and capture enemy soldiers. When Powers finds out, he bawls them out and threatens Highway with a court-martial, but their commanding officer, Colonel Meyers, arrives and reprimands Powers for discouraging initiative and fighting spirit.
When Highway and his men return to the U.S., they are met by a warm reception. Aggie is there to welcome him back. To Highway's mock dismay, Stitch informs him that he is going to stay and make a career for himself in the Marines, while Highway takes his mandatory retirement.","jogging,soldiers,gunny,fitness,trust,joy,gunnery sargeant,loyalty,fighting,rough",342.jpg,1986-12-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/heartbreak-ridge/id279249597?uo=4,k7AZt-IUIhs,60011708,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Heartbreak_Ridge/60011708,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

3314,Heathers,"A girl who half-heartedly tries to be part of the ""in crowd"" of her school meets a rebel who teaches her a more devious way to play social politics.

A regular girl, Veronica, tries to survive the social jungle of high school by sticking with the three most popular girls at school who are all called Heather. As she meets a sociopath named JD, her life spirals into a continuous cycle of hate, unintentional murder and indifference, as she exacts revenge on her enemies, also known as her best friends.
","17-year-old Veronica Sawyer (Ryder) is one of the most popular girls at Westerburg High School in Sherwood, Ohio. In addition to Veronica, the popular clique consists of three wealthy and beautiful girls with the same first name: the leader, Heather Chandler (Walker); the bookish bulimic Heather Duke (Doherty), and the weak-willed cheerleader Heather McNamara (Falk). Though they are the most popular students, the Heathers are feared and hated. Veronica has had enough of their behavior and longs to return to her old life and her nerdy friends.
When a new student, a rebellious outsider named Jason ""J.D."" Dean (Slater) pulls a gun on school bullies Kurt Kelly (Fenton) and Ram Sweeney (Labyorteaux) and fires blanks at them, Veronica finds herself fascinated with him. When Veronica attends a frat party with Heather Chandler, but refuses to have sex and throws up, Heather vows to destroy her reputation. J.D. shows up at Veronica's house and they end up having sex outside, after which Veronica tells J.D. she wants to make Heather puke her guts out. The next morning, Veronica and J.D. break into Heather's house. J.D. serves Heather a liquid he claims is a hangover cure but is actually drain cleaner, killing her. J.D. urges Veronica to forge a dramatic suicide note in Heather's handwriting.
The school and community look on Heather's apparent suicide as a tragic decision made by a popular but troubled teenager. Heather Duke soon steps into Heather Chandler's former role as clique leader and begins wearing a red scrunchie that had belonged to Chandler.
Several days later, Kurt and Ram spread a rumor about Veronica giving them oral sex, ruining her reputation. J.D. proposes that Veronica lure them into the woods with the promise to ""make the rumors true""; then shoot them with nonfatal German bullets. JD shoots Ram but Veronica misses Kurt, who runs away. Veronica realizes that the bullets are real; J.D. chases Kurt back towards Veronica, who panics and shoots him. J.D. plants ""gay"" materials beside the boys, and a suicide note stating the two were lovers participating in a suicide pact. At their funeral, the boys are made into martyrs against homophobia. Although she keeps dating J.D., Veronica is alarmed by his behavior.
Martha Dunnstock, an obese, regularly bullied student known as ""Martha Dumptruck"", pins a suicide note to her chest and walks into traffic. She survives but is badly injured and is mocked for trying to ""act popular"". Heather McNamara calls a popular radio show one night while Veronica and Heather Duke are listening and talks of depression in her life; the next day, Heather Duke tells the entire school about Heather McNamara's radio call; McNamara attempts to take her life by overdosing on pills in the girls' bathroom but is saved by Veronica.
Veronica tells J.D. that she will not participate in any more killings. He climbs into her room with a revolver to kill her, but Veronica has used a harness to make it look like she has hanged herself. Thinking her dead, he rambles about his plan to blow up the school during a pep rally. A petition he has been circulating via Heather Duke, to get the band Big Fun to perform on campus was actually a mass suicide note. Most of the students had already signed, so the mass murder would appear to be a mass suicide instead.
Veronica confronts J.D. in the boiler room, where he is rigging timed explosives. She shoots him when he refuses to stop the bomb. As J.D. collapses, he stabs the timer and it stops. Veronica walks out through the pep rally with everyone cheering. The severely injured J.D. follows her outside with a bomb strapped to his chest, offers what amounts to a personal eulogy as Veronica looks on, and detonates the bomb.
Veronica confronts Heather Duke, takes the red scrunchie, says ""Heather my love, there's a new sheriff in town"" and invites Martha Dunnstock to hang out on prom night and watch movies with her.",,3314.jpg,1988-10,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/heathers/id468418525?uo=4 ,,,,"Comedy,Drama"
766,Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"A transexual punk rock girl from East Berlin tours the US with her rock band as she tells her life story and follows the ex-boyfriend/bandmate who stole her songs.

Hedwig, born a boy named Hansel in East Berlin, fell in love with an American G.I. and underwent a sex-change operation in order to marry him and flee to the West. Unfortunately, nothing worked out quite as it was supposed to - years later, Hedwig is leading her rock band on a tour of the U.S., telling her life story through a series of concerts at Bilgewater Inn seafood restaurants. Her tour dates coincide with those of arena-rock star Tommy Gnosis, a wide-eyed boy who once loved Hedwig... but then left with all her songs.","Hansel Schmidt is an East German ""slip of a girly boy"" who loves rock music, and is stuck in East Berlin until he meets Luther Robinson, an American soldier. Luther falls in love with Hansel and the two decide to marry. This plan will allow Hansel to leave communist East Germany for the capitalist West. However, in order to be married, the couple must consist of a man and a woman. Hansel's mother, Hedwig, gives her child her name and passport and finds a doctor to perform a sex change. The operation is botched, however, leaving Hansel ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ now Hedwig ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ with a dysfunctional one-inch mound of flesh between her legs, the eponymous ""Angry Inch"".
Hedwig goes to live in Junction City, Kansas as Luther's wife. On their first wedding anniversary, Luther leaves Hedwig for a man. That same day, it is announced that the Berlin Wall has fallen and Germany will reunite, meaning as material gains go, Hedwig's sacrifices have been for nothing. Hedwig recovers from the separation by forming a rock band composed of Korean-born Army wives (The guitarist, Kwahng-Yi, is played by Sook-Yin Lee who stars in Mitchell's 2006 film, Shortbus). Hedwig befriends a shy and misunderstood Christian teenager, Tommy Speck, with whom she writes some songs. Hedwig falls in love with Tommy, and believes he is her ""other half"". Hedwig gives him the stage name ""Tommy Gnosis"" (stating that Gnosis is the Greek word for ""knowledge""), but he later leaves her and goes on to become a wildly successful rock star with the songs Hedwig wrote alone and with him. ""Internationally ignored"" Hedwig and her band of Eastern Europeans, the Angry Inch, are forced to support themselves by playing coffee bars and strip mall dives. Throughout the film, these gigs are performed at a chain seafood restaurant called Bilgewater's. Hedwig is following Tommy's tour in order to pursue a copyright lawsuit. She tells unsuspecting diners her life story.
Throughout the film, Hedwig refers to Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium. This myth, retold by Hedwig in the song ""The Origin of Love"", explains that human beings were once round, two-faced, four-armed, and four-legged beings. Angry gods split these early humans in two, leaving the separated people with a lifelong yearning for their other half. Near the end of the film, Hedwig is down and out. While working as a streetwalker, she finally meets Gnosis and they reconcile. After paparazzi burst onto the scene, Hedwig becomes famous and Gnosis' popularity suffers. Reunited with her band, Hedwig performs at Times Square Bilgewater's culminating in a violent removal of her drag.
Entering the final chapter of the film, it seems to take place in a non-real space, perhaps Hedwig's mind. Now in male form, Hedwig discovers him/herself alone in front of Tommy on a huge stage. He sings to her, pleading forgiveness and saying goodbye; she realizes that she created her ""other half"" from within herself. Hedwig then finds him/herself in white heavenly space with her band and an audience all dressed in white. Hedwig gives Yitzhak her blonde wig and sings a song of triumph and solidarity with ""all the misfits and losers"" of the world. A brief animated sequence symbolizing the union of the separated Platonic halves leads to the final shot: Hedwig walking naked down a dark alley and into the street.",,766.jpg,2001-01-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hedwig-and-the-angry-inch/id305194600?uo=4,,60004459,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hedwig_and_the_Angry_Inch/60004459,"Comedy,Drama,Musical & Performing Arts"

Does the world really need another horror spoof? One taking aim at two sub-genres (old dark house and exorcism) that've been sent up more times than Bruce Campbell's been asked about Evil Dead 4?

Let's be clear: Hell Baby isn't art, but it's better than the Epic/Date/Disaster Movie axis of evil (high praise, right?) and scores just enough hits to balance the misses in its scattergun approach.

Writer/directors Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant triple-up as Vatican exorcists investigating a demon pregnancy in New Orleans.

654,Hellboy,"From visionary writer/director Guillermo del Toro (director of Blade II, The Devil's Backbone) comes Hellboy, a supernatural action adventure based on Mike Mignola's popular Dark Horse Comics series of the same name. Born in the flames of hell and brought to Earth as an infant to perpetrate evil, Hellboy (Ron Perlman) was rescued from sinister forces by the benevolent Dr. Broom (John Hurt), who raised him to be a hero. In Dr. Broom's secret Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, Hellboy creates an unlikely family consisting of the telepathic ""Mer-Man"" Abe Sapien (Doug Jones) and Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), the woman he loves who can control fire. Hidden from the very society that they protect, they stand as the key line of defense against an evil madman who seeks to reclaim Hellboy to the dark side and use his powers to destroy mankind.","In 1944, the Nazis build a dimensional portal off the coast of Scotland. With the help of Russian mystic Grigori Rasputin, they intend to free the Ogdru Jahad‚Äö√Ñ√Æmonstrous entities imprisoned in another dimension‚Äö√Ñ√Æto aid them in defeating the Allies. Rasputin knows that this will be an apocalyptic event that he believes will create a paradise. He opens the portal with the aid of his disciples, Ilsa von Haupstein and Obersturmbannf‚àö¬∫hrer Karl Ruprecht Kroenen, member of the Thule Society and Adolf Hitler's top assassin. An Allied team is sent to destroy the portal, guided by young Trevor Bruttenholm, who is well-versed in the occult. The German team is killed and the portal is destroyed‚Äö√Ñ√Æin the process absorbing Rasputin‚Äö√Ñ√Æwhile Haupstein and Kroenen escape. The Allied team discovers an infant demon with a right hand of stone came through the portal; they dub it ""Hellboy"".
Sixty years later, FBI agent John Myers is transferred to the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD) at the request of Bruttenholm and he meets the adult Hellboy and a psychic, amphibious humanoid named Abe Sapien. He learns that a third BPRD member, Liz Sherman, has recently checked into a mental hospital to protect others from her volatile pyrokinetic abilities. Despite regular visits and coaxing from Hellboy, she is determined not to return. Kroenen and Haupstein resurrect Rasputin in the mountains of Moldova. The three unleash a hellhound known as Sammael. Rasputin imbues Sammael with the power to reincarnate and split his essence, causing two of the creature's eggs to hatch and mature each time one dies. Rasputin visits Liz as she sleeps, activating her powers and almost destroying the hospital. Myers convinces her to return to the Bureau.
Sammael's ability to multiply becomes a problem, as Hellboy repeatedly kills it, creating dozens. Abe is injured while retrieving some of its eggs, and Kroenen critically wounds one of the FBI agents sent with Hellboy. Kroenen, whose mutilated body is run by mechanical parts, shuts himself down, pretending to be defeated. Kroenen's body is brought to the bureau. FBI Director Tom Manning is angered by Hellboy's recklessness. Myers takes Liz out for coffee and to talk. Hellboy, jealous, covertly follows them. Rasputin appears at the bureau, reanimating Kroenen before confronting Professor Bruttenholm. Rasputin offers him a vision of the future, showing Hellboy is the agent that will destroy the world. Rasputin tells Bruttenholm he will give him a quick death in return for the care he gave Hellboy. Bruttenholm is stabbed in the neck by Kroenen and dies clutching a rosary.
Manning takes over the B.P.R.D. and locates Rasputin's mausoleum in an old cemetery outside Moscow, Russia. A team led by Manning and Hellboy enter the mausoleum, but swiftly become separated. Hellboy and Manning find their way to Kroenen's lair and defeat him. Telling Manning to stay back, Hellboy reunites with Liz and Myers at Sammael's nest to defend them, but the creatures overwhelm him. Liz uses her pyrokinetic powers to incinerate the Sammaels and their eggs. Hellboy, Liz and Myers lose consciousness and are captured by Rasputin. To force Hellboy to release the Ogdru Jahad, Rasputin sucks Liz's soul out of her body, telling Hellboy that Liz will come back to life if he obeys. Hellboy awakens his true power as Anung un Rama, causing his horns to regrow. He nearly releases the Ogdru Jahad, but the injured Myers reminds him of who he is and that he has the right to choose his own path. Remembering his true self and what Bruttenholm brought him up to be, Hellboy breaks off his horns, returning to his former self and resealing the Ogdru Jahad. Hellboy stabs Rasputin with one of his broken horns.
Rasputin has been possessed by a creature from the Ogdru Jahad. The tentacled Behemoth bursts out of Rasputin's body and grows to immense size, killing Rasputin and Ilsa. Hellboy allows himself to be swallowed by the beast while detonating a belt of hand grenades. The explosion tears the Behemoth apart. Liz's vital signs are gone when Hellboy returns from the fight, but he whispers into her ear and her life is restored. When she asks how her soul was returned, Hellboy replies that he told the creatures from the other side the cost of taking her: ""Hey, you on the other side. Let her go. Because for her I'll cross over, and then you'll be sorry."" She and Hellboy kiss, and she surrounds them in flame as Myers stands and watches.","exciting,suspenseful,stylized",654.jpg,2004-03-30, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hellboy/id263248545?uo=4,557Qpie_KWk,60034549,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hellboy/60034549,"Action & Adventure,Horror,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

3631,Hero,"HERO starring martial arts legend Jet Li in a visually stunning martial arts epic where a fearless warrior rises up to defy an empire and unite a nation! With supernatural skill ... and no fear ... a nameless soldier (Jet Li) embarks on a mission of revenge against the fearsome army that massacred his people. Now, to achieve the justice he seeks, he must take on the empire's most ruthless assassins and reach the enemy he has sworn to defeat! Acclaimed by critics and honored with numerous awards, HERO was nominated for both an Oscar (2002 Best Foreign Language Film) and Golden Globe!","In ancient China during the Warring States Period, a nameless prefect of a small jurisdiction arrives at the Qin state's capital city to meet the king of Qin, who has survived an attempt on his life by the assassins Long Sky, Flying Snow, and Broken Sword. Therefore, no visitors are to approach him within 100 paces. 'Nameless' (Jet Li) claims that he has slain the three assassins and he displays their weapons before the king, who allows Nameless to sit closer to him and tell him his story.
Nameless recounts killing Long Sky at a weiqi parlor; later to meet Flying Snow and Broken Sword at a calligraphy school in the Zhao state, where he set them against each other until Snow killed Sword and was herself slain by Nameless. As the tale concludes, the king expresses disbelief and accuses Nameless of staging the duels with the assassins, who surrendered their lives to allow him to gain the king's trust and take the king's life.
Nameless admits that he is a native of the Zhao state and that his family was killed by Qin soldiers, and confesses that he defeated Sky without killing him and had proposed co-operation to Snow and Sword. After Snow's apparent death, Sword approached Nameless and told him that the only way to achieve peace was to unite the states under a common dynasty; namely that of Qin, which alone has the ability to do so, thus revealing why Sword gave up his earlier assassination attempt.
The king, affected by the tale and by Sword's understanding of his dream to unify China, ceases to fear Nameless. He then tosses his sword to Nameless and examines a scroll drawn by Sword, and understands that it explains the ideal warrior, who, paradoxically, should have no desire to kill. When Nameless realizes the wisdom of these words, he abandons his mission and spares the king.
Meanwhile, when Snow learns that Sword had convinced Nameless to forgo the assassination, she furiously challenges Sword to a fight and unintentionally kills him when he chooses not to defend himself so that she would understand his hopes for universal peace. Overwhelmed by guilt, Snow then commits suicide. At the Qin palace, the king reluctantly orders Nameless killed, being urged thereto by his court. As the film ends, Nameless receives a hero's funeral and a closing text identifies the king as Qin Shi Huang.",,3631.jpg, ,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hero/id432513103?uo=4 ,1p2p8OAdxro,,,"Action & Adventure,Art House & International,Classics,Drama"

720,High Plains Drifter,"Clint Eastwood's second film as a director finds the celebrated action star returning to his familiar Old West stomping grounds and his internationally acclaimed role of ""The Man With No Name."" This time, The Stranger (Eastwood) mysteriously appears out of the heat waves of the desert and rides into the lawless, sin-ridden town of Lago. After making a name for himself with a string of blazing gun battles, The Stranger is hired by the townspeople to provide protection from three ruthless gunmen just out of jail. The Stranger quickly proceeds to paint the entire town bright red, rename it ""Hell,"" and supply divine retribution in the fiery, pulse-pounding climax of this acclaimed western shoot-em-up.","A stranger on horseback materializes from the shimmering heat in the distance and rides into the mining town of Lago, Texas. Three gun-toting men follow him into the saloon, taunting him. When they follow him to the barbershop, he kills all three of them. Impressed with this performance, a dwarf named Mordecai befriends the Stranger. An attractive woman named Callie Travers bumps into him in the street and insults and badgers him. When she slaps him, he drags her into the livery stable and rapes her. Next, he rents a room at the hotel. That night, he dreams about a man being brutally whipped. It is revealed later that Marshal Jim Duncan was whipped to death by gunfighters Stacey Bridges, Dan Carlin, and Cole Carlin while the people of Lago looked on. Only Sarah Belding, wife of hotelier Lewis Belding, made any attempt to rescue him.
The next day, Sheriff Shaw tells the stranger he will not be charged for killing the three men. Meanwhile, the townsmen discuss Bridges and the Carlin brothers, who are due to be released from prison that day. The town double-crossed the three gunfighters after they had killed Duncan, to silence Duncan who was expected to disclose authorities that local mining interests were mining on government land, the men are expected to seek vengeance. Since the men slain by the Stranger were the mining company's new protectors, the townsmen decide to hire the Stranger as their replacement.
Presenting the offer to the Stranger, Shaw explains that the three gunfighters were caught stealing gold from the mining company, although he admits the gold was poorly protected. The Stranger declines the job until Shaw tells him he can have anything he wants. Accepting these terms, the Stranger indulges in the town's goods and services, makes Mordecai both sheriff and mayor, has the entire town painted red, and paints the word ""HELL"" on the ""LAGO"" sign just outside of town.
While the Stranger trains the townspeople to defend themselves, Bridges and the Carlin brothers are released from prison and make their way to Lago. They begin on foot but kill three men and take their horses.
A group of men try to ambush the Stranger in the hotel, but he kills most of them. After Belding inadvertently divulges his complicity in the attack, which left the hotel destroyed, the Stranger drags Belding's wife into their room and she sleeps with him willingly.
In the morning, the Stranger rides out and finds the gunfighters, has a brief shootout with them, and returns to Lago. With the town painted red, townsmen with rifles stationed on rooftops, and a picnic and welcoming banner set up for the gunfighters, the Stranger mounts his horse and rides away. When the gunfighters arrive, they encounter almost no resistance, and by nightfall they have the townspeople collected in the saloon. The Stranger returns and kills the gunfighters one by one. Mordecai shoots Belding when he attempts to shoot the Stranger in the back.
The next day, the Stranger begins to ride out of the ruined town, as Mordecai carves a headstone for Duncan's grave. Mordecai comments to the departing Stranger that he never did know his name, to which the Stranger cryptically replies, ""Yes, you do."" He rides off into the distance, vanishing in the distance as he had first appeared in the shimmering heat.","bleak,cynical,suspenseful,stylized,rough,atmospheric,fear,gloomy",720.jpg,1973-04-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/high-plains-drifter/id281703084?uo=4,i1almB9zxX4,,,"Classics,Drama,Western"

They quickly become close friends and accidentally audition for the school musical. After getting a callback, drama queen Sharpay Evans and her sidekick brother Ryan are furious. Then Chad, Troy's best friend and basketball teammate, and Taylor, Gabriella's new friend on the decathlon team, must find out a way to make Gabriella hate Troy.","On New Year's Eve, Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez meet at a New Year's Eve party while both teenagers are at a ski lodge during winter break. At the party, the two are called upon to sing karaoke together (Start of Something New). They seem to be attracted to each other, and exchange numbers before parting.
After Christmas break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom, and she explains that she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico and transferred to East High School over break. Troy shows Gabriella around the school, and they pause in front of the sign-up sheet for the winter musical auditions. This alarms Drama Club president Sharpay Evans, who assumes that Gabriella is interested in auditioning. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl and arranges for the scholastic decathlon captain, Taylor McKessie, to find out about Gabriella's past academic achievements.
During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing more (Get'cha Head In the Game). Gabriella and Troy both go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan perform (What I've Been Looking For) but both are too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally summons the courage to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but Ms. Darbus tells them that they are too late. After Ms. Darbus apparently leaves, Kelsi Nielson, the composer of the musical, trips and drops her things. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano (What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)). Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.
When the callback list is posted, Sharpay is furious to learn that she has competition for the lead in the musical, and the rest of the Wildcats are shocked that Troy and Gabriella have auditioned for a musical. Other students confess their own secret passions and talents (Stick To The Status Quo), alarming both Taylor and Troy's friend Chad Danforth. Since Gabriella has agreed to join the scholastic decathlon team, both Taylor and Chad want their teammates to focus on their upcoming competitions rather than the musical. To help Troy and Gabriella return to normal, Chad and the basketball team trick Troy into saying that Gabriella is not important while she watches through a wi-fi link that the scholastic decathlon team has set up. Gabriella is hurt (When There Was Me And You), she refuses to talk to Troy and decides not to audition for the musical. Chad and Taylor feel guilty for ruining Troy and Gabriella's relationship, and decide to tell them the truth. After Chad and the basketball team tell Troy what they did and offer to support him in callbacks, Troy goes to Gabriella's house and they make up.
Intimidated after overhearing Gabriella and Troy practicing, Sharpay convinces Ms. Darbus to change the callback time to coincide with both the basketball championship and the scholastic decathlon, so that Gabriella and Troy cannot participate. Kelsi overhears the conversation and the basketball team and the decathlon team work together to come up with a plan. On the day of the competitions, Taylor and Gabriella use the school's computers to cause a series of mishaps that delay the big game and the decathlon. With both competitions delayed, Troy and Gabriella rush to the auditorium, and Sharpay and Ryan finish performing their song (Bop To The Top), confident that their plan worked. Troy and Gabriella then audition (Breaking Free) and Ms. Darbus gives Troy and Gabriella the lead roles, making Sharpay and Ryan understudies. Troy and Gabriella both win their respective competitions, and the film ends when the entire school gathers in the gym to celebrate (We're All In This Together).

He even kidnaps Hildy's stern mother-in-law-to-be (Alma Kruger). When Williams escapes from the bumbling sheriff (Gene Lockhart) and practically falls into Hildy's lap, the lure of a big scoop proves too much for her. She is so consumed with writing the story that she hardly notices as Bruce realizes his cause is hopeless and returns to Albany.
The crooked mayor (Clarence Kolb) and sheriff need the publicity from the execution to keep their jobs in an upcoming election, so when a messenger (Billy Gilbert) brings them a reprieve from the governor, they try to bribe the man to go away and return later, when it will be too late. Walter and Hildy find out just in time to save Walter from being arrested for kidnapping.
Afterward, Walter offers to remarry Hildy, promising to take her on the honeymoon they never had in Niagara Falls, but then Walter learns that there is a newsworthy strike in Albany, which is on the way to Niagara Falls by train.","witty,humorous,clever,biting",293.jpg,1940-01-11, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/his-girl-friday/id293333489?uo=4,dHVvnEWez1M,60003729,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/His_Girl_Friday/60003729,"Classics,Comedy,Drama"

964,Hoodwinked,"Everyone knows the story of Little Red Riding Hood...or so they think. That's all about to change because no one has ever seen their favorite fairy tale quite like this -- turned upside-down, inside-out and reinvented as a computer-animated caper comedy that at last reveals the shocking true-crime investigation behind the legend. At last, the full story can be revealed of how Red (Anne Hathaway), Granny (Glenn Close), The Woodsman (Jim Belushi) and the Wolf (Patrick Warburton) all came together as criminal suspects in a case that almost ""Hoodwinked"" the law. With inventive story telling, spunk and wit, filmmakers Cory & Todd and Tony Leech bring to the screen a story for the young, the young at heart and everyone in between.","Little Red Riding Hood discovers that the Big Bad Wolf has disguised himself as Granny, just as the axe-wielding woodsman bursts through the window, startling everyone. The police quickly arrive, and Red, Wolf, Granny and the Woodsman are questioned by detective Nicky Flippers about the events leading up to the incident.
Red explains that she was delivering goodies for her grandmother when she discovered a threat from the mysterious Goodie Bandit. Hoping to save her Granny‚Äö√Ñ√¥s recipes, she embarked upon a journey to take them to the top of a nearby mountain where her Granny lives. On her way, she encountered the Wolf, who asked her a series of suspicious questions. She managed to escape, and eventually reached her Granny‚Äö√Ñ√¥s house; however she found the Wolf already waiting in ambush.
What at first seems to be an open-and-shut case becomes confused though, once it is learned that the Wolf is an investigative reporter. He reveals that he was searching for a lead on the identity of the Goodie Bandit, and had reason to believe that Granny and Red were the culprits. Locating Red, he questioned her, hoping to get to the bottom of the mystery. When Red escaped, he headed for her Granny‚Äö√Ñ√¥s house and arriving first, went undercover, hoping to trick her into giving him the evidence he needed.
When questioned, the Woodsman reveals that he is in fact an aspiring actor who was only trying out for the part of a woodsman in a commercial. After his schnitzel truck was robbed by the Goodie Bandit, he went out into the woods to get in character for his role, and spent the rest of the day felling trees. An especially large tree rolled after him, and pushed him through the window of Granny‚Äö√Ñ√¥s home. The investigation then turns to Granny, who reveals that, unbeknownst to her family, she is an extreme sports enthusiast. During a ski race earlier that day, she was attacked by the opposing team, but got away safely after learning that they were hired by the Goodie Bandit.
Despondent over her Granny‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lack of honesty, Red wanders off alone. Meanwhile, Nicky Flippers realizes that the one commonality between all four stories was a bunny named Boingo, and concludes that he is the Goodie Bandit. However, Boingo has already snuck into the home and stolen Granny‚Äö√Ñ√¥s recipes. Red sees Boingo and follows him to his hideout at a cable car station, but the police pursue him in the wrong direction. Granny, the Wolf, and the Woodsman manage to locate Boingo as he is explaining his evil scheme to Red. Boingo plans to add an addictive substance to the stolen recipes, and then explode the forest, making way for new real estate for expanding his business.
The Wolf and the Woodsman go undercover to distract Boingo as Granny sneaks into his lair, but open conflict ensues. Boingo sends a bound and gagged Red down the mountain in a cable car loaded with explosives, and Granny goes after her, with Boingo and his henchmen in pursuit. Red manages to free herself, and escapes with Granny, while the police, who have been located by the Wolf‚Äö√Ñ√¥s assistant Twitchy, are waiting at the bottom of the mountain to arrest Boingo and his henchmen. Some time later, the Woodsman finds success as part of a yodeling troupe, and Red, Granny, the Wolf, and Twitchy are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join a crime solving organization called Happily Ever After Agency.","surprise,joy",964.jpg,2006-01-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hoodwinked/id306982055?uo=4,,,,"Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family"

2150,Hostage,"A failed police negotiator turned small town cop, must save the lives of a family held hostage, which draws him into a much more dangerous situation.

Jeff Talley, a former LAPD hostage negotiator, has moved himself away from his failed career outside of Los Angeles, and away from his wife and daughter. When a convenience store robbery goes wrong in his turf, the three perpetrators move in on an unsuspecting family. But the family's father has a secret which might compromise his kin, and one of the criminals is about to jump over the edge. Jeff Talley has to get everybody to survive the night if he can.","Former SWAT officer Jeff Talley is a hostage negotiator in Los Angeles. Talley is negotiating with a man who has taken his wife and son hostage after learning she has been cheating on him. Talley denies a SWAT commander's request to give snipers the green light to take out the suspect. There are three gunshots in the house. Talley runs through the barricaded door and finds the man and his wife dead. In the boy's room he finds the son, who passes away in Talley's arms. This leaves Talley emotionally scarred. He moves with his family to become police chief in Bristo Camino, a peaceful suburban hamlet in Ventura County, California.
A year after the incident, Talley finds himself in another hostage situation. Two teenagers, Dennis and his brother Kevin, and their mysterious accomplice Marshall ""Mars"" Krupcheck take hostage Walter Smith and his two children, a teenager Jennifer and a young child Tommy, in Smith's house after a failed robbery attempt. The first officer to respond, Carol Flores, is brutally shot twice by Mars just before Talley and a fellow officer arrive. Talley attempts to rescue the seriously injured officer, who dies in front of him. Traumatized and unwilling to put himself through yet another life-or-death situation, Talley hands authority over to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department and leaves.
Smith has been laundering money for a mysterious criminal syndicate through offshore shell corporations. He was preparing to turn over a batch of important encrypted files (recorded on a DVD) when he was taken hostage. To protect such incriminating evidence from discovery, the syndicate orders someone known only as the Watchman to kidnap Talley's wife and daughter. Talley is told to return to the hostage scene and stall for time until the organization can launch its own attack against Smith's house.
Dennis has his partners Mars and Kevin tie up the kids. Dennis pistol-whips Walter, knocking him out, then finds a large amount of cash. In an attempt to end the standoff (and secure the DVDs himself), Talley meets with Dennis and agrees to provide a helicopter in exchange for half the money. When the helicopter arrives, Dennis and Kevin bring the money to Talley in the courtyard and prepare to leave, but Mars refuses to leave without Jennifer. Talley tries to get the boys to leave Jennifer and walk away, but he says that the helicopter will only carry three additional people, and insists that Jennifer stay behind. The deal breaks down as the boys return to the house. Talley tells the chopper to stand down and he exits the courtyard.
Kevin is upset that his older brother picked Mars over him and confronts Dennis, demanding he make a decision: it's either him or Mars. Dennis picks the money and Kevin is even more upset so he grabs the bags full of money and empties them onto the floor, so Dennis punches him. Thomas escapes, grabs his father's gun and talks to Talley on Jennifer's cell phone.
Talley learns that Mars is a killer, who could turn on the hostages and his own accomplices at any moment. Mars does, in fact, kill Kevin, just when Kevin is about to release the kids to the police. Dennis comes to Kevin's side and assumes the cops killed him. Mars then shoots Dennis. The brothers die in each other's arms.
The syndicate sends fake FBI agents to recover the DVD and they storm the house. Mars is stabbed in the cheek by Jennifer. She and her brother flee. They lock themselves in the house's panic room. Talley hears the children screaming as they flee.
Mars throws a Molotov Cocktail at Talley, destroying his patrol car. Mars begins to kill the majority of the fake FBI agents using his pistol and multiple Molotov Cocktails, but is shot in the side by the only surviving agent. The agent tracks down Talley and the children, demanding to be given the encrypted DVD. Talley gives him the DVD. Mars reappears, distracting the agent long enough to be killed by Talley.
Mars prepares to throw the last bomb and kill everyone in the room. He collapses to his knees, weakened by the wounds in his torso and blood loss. He makes eye contact with Jennifer, with whom he was apparently infatuated, then drops the Molotov Cocktail. Mars dies, setting himself on fire and vanishing in a pillar of flame.
Talley evacuates the hostages. He and Walter Smith then go to the inn where Talley's wife and daughter are being held hostage by the Watchman and other masked men. Smith, set free by Talley and grateful for his own family being saved, shoots the Watchman in the head. This allows Talley to kill the other masked gunmen. Talley's family is safe.","stylized,bleak,rough,suspenseful",2150.jpg,2005-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hostage/id432513145?uo=4,8j5BYJKtVc8,70018724,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hostage/70018724,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

The McDonald's coffee case has been routinely cited by the media as an example of how citizens have taken advantage of the legal system.

We will tell the truth and let the audience decide if spilling hot coffee is really as profitable as they might otherwise believe. ","Everyone knows the case of the woman who sued McDonald's over spilled coffee. Or do they?

An eye-opening documentary with jaw-dropping revelations, HOT COFFEE exposes how corporations spend millions on propaganda campaigns to distort Americans' view of lawsuits, forever changing the civil justice system. By examining the impact of tort reform on the lives of ordinary citizens, the film shows how Americans give up their Constitutional rights in all sorts of ways without knowing it, for example, by voting for caps on damages or signing away your rights in contracts.

39,Hot Rod,"Andy Samberg (Saturday Night Live) stars as Rod Kimble, a stunt man with a fake mustache and a dream, in this outrageous comedy so unpredictable you won't know what hit you! Rod has never landed a jump without wiping out. His family and friends think he‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s a joke. And, to top it off, his stepfather Frank uses him as his own personal punching bag. But he's not going to let a few minor problems keep him from the biggest stunt of his life! Co-starring Isla Fisher (Wedding Crashers) and Ian McShane (Shrek the Third), Hot Rod is ""very, very funny from start to finish""* and scales the heights of hilarity as Rod defies death to win the money, win the girl and, ultimately, win some respect.

Self-proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble is preparing for the jump of his life - to clear fifteen buses to raise money for his abusive stepfather Frank's life-saving heart operation. Kimble is a na‚àö√òf, a slacker living in a small US town with his mom, his younger brother, and his stepfather whose respect he craves. He also misses his dead dad, whom he thinks was Evel Knievel's back-up. Rod, a man-child, believes that he is a stunt man. When his stepfather needs an operation, with help from his brother and his slacker pals, Rod hatches a plan to set a school-bus-jumping record on his moped. First, his crew and he have to raise money to rent the buses and build the ramp. Trouble is, Rod's inept at his chosen career. Looming failure is complicated by the return of Denise, Rod's next-door neighbor and secret heartthrob, who is home from college. Is public humiliation at hand?
","Throughout his entire life, Rod Kimble (Andy Samberg) believed his father, now deceased, was a successful and respectable stuntman working for Evel Knievel. He aspires to follow in his father's footsteps and become a famous stuntman himself. Meanwhile, his stepfather Frank (Ian McShane) fails to respect Rod as a man, often going out of his way to beat him in sparring sessions and mocking his stuntman dream.
Rod makes many attempts at landing jumps with his Hyundai moped, most of them ending unsuccessfully. After an ill-fated jump attempt at the public pool, he returns home to find out that Frank is in urgent need of a heart transplant. Angry at the thought of his stepfather dying without getting a chance to ""smash his face in"" and gain his respect, Rod goes to a forest to be mad and starts dancing out of rage (a sequence loosely based on the movie Footloose), ending up with Rod rolling down an enormous hill after tripping. At the bottom of the hill, he sees a sign that gives him an idea to save Frank. He tells his friends Rico (Danny R. McBride), Dave (Bill Hader) and his half brother Kevin (Jorma Taccone) about his plan to do a jump over the length of fifteen school buses, and give the proceeds to his stepfather's surgery. He also adds Denise (Isla Fisher), his college-graduate neighbor on whom he has a crush, to his crew.
To promote his stunt and also raise funds, Rod works parties, corporate get togethers, and other events, performing activities such as taping pillows to his body and having a washing machine, suspended by a crane, swing to hit him. Kevin releases a movie using his footage of Rod's stunts and sells over 200 tickets, but everyone at the movie laughs at Rod's expense because the film depicts his failed training attempts. Rod gets angry and throws the theater's projector out of a window, smashing a car below. Rod ends up giving up all the money he has raised so far to cover the respective damages. Upset, he returns home, where his mother reveals to him that his father was not the stuntman he thought he was. Humiliated, Rod quits the crew and ends his dream to beat up his stepfather, despite his friends' interventions. However, he takes up the jump again when Dave asks Rod to take him to the hospital due to an injury while ""trippin' balls"" under the influence of acid given to him by his friend Derek (Akiva Schaffer). When he does, Dave gives him advice that inspires Rod to apologize to Kevin. As Kevin accepts his apology, he also reveals that Rod's stunt footage has gotten popular through the Internet, and a local AM radio station hosted by Barry Pasternak (Chris Parnell) offers to cover the expenses of the jump.
Rod gets the crew back together and they start setting up for the jump. On the day of the jump, his friends give him a new suit, a rock (to represent extensive pyrotechnic work done by Rico), and a motorbike. He also receives a kiss from Denise, who broke up with Jonathan (Will Arnett), her insensitive and callous boyfriend. As Rod jumps off the ramp, the speed of his new motorbike enables him to jump over the buses, but as he gives his friends a thumbs up, they realize that he had let go of his bike in the process. The bike smashes through a stage and Rod's body slams against ground, sliding and skidding before he finally stops. As his friends nurse him from his unconscious state, he has a 'freaky, out of body experience' in which he witnesses an anthropomorphic taco beating up a grilled cheese sandwich‚Äö√Ñ√Æa topic he and Denise had a debate over earlier in the movie. Rod, with the help of Kevin and Denise, triumphantly gets up to the applause of the crowd, and sees that the donations have accumulated over $50,000, the cost of Frank's 'conveniently priced' surgery.

2957,House of Flying Daggers,"""Prepare your eyes for popping,"" in this ""martial-arts fireball that throws in a lyrical love story, headspinning fights and dazzling surprises"" (Rolling Stone). ""A gorgeous entertainment"" (A.O. Scott, New York Times). Mei is an exotic, beautiful blind dancer, associated with a dangerous revolutionary gang, known as the House of Flying Daggers. Captured by officers of the decadent Tang Dynasty, Mei finds herself both threatened - and attracted - to the most unusual circumstances. Here, her heart and loyalties battle each other, amid warriors in the treetops and dazzling combat - the likes of which have never before been seen! A romantic police captain breaks a beautiful member of a rebel group out of prison to help her rejoin her fellows, but things are not what they seem.

During the reign of the Tang dynasty in China, a secret organization called ""The House of the Flying Daggers"" rises and opposes the government. A police officer called Leo sends officer Jin to investigate a young dancer named Mei, claiming that she has ties to the ""Flying Daggers"". Leo arrests Mei, only to have Jin breaking her free in a plot to gain her trust and lead the police to the new leader of the secret organization. But things are far more complicated than they seem.
","The film is set in 859 AD. The once great Tang Dynasty is now in decline. Numerous rebel groups have formed, the largest of which is the House of Flying Daggers, based in Feng Tian county. The Flying Daggers steal from the rich and give to the poor, gaining the support of the locals.
The local deputies have managed to kill the leader of the Flying Daggers, but the rebel group only becomes stronger, due to a mysterious new leader. Jin (Takeshi Kaneshiro) and Liu (Andy Lau), two police captains, are ordered to kill the new leader within ten days.
In order to accomplish this, they arrest Mei (Zhang Ziyi), a blind dancer who is suspected of being the daughter of the old leader of the Flying Daggers. While Mei is incarcerated, Jin and Liu decide to let her go to track the mastermind; Jin will pretend to be a lone warrior called Wind, and break her out of prison. This will gain her trust, and hopefully, Jin will be led to the headquarters of Flying Daggers. The plan works, but Mei and Jin fall in love on the way. They are followed at a distance by Liu; Jin and Liu meet secretly to discuss their plans. Jin jokes about his seduction of the girl; Liu warns him sternly against getting involved.
To add authenticity to the deception, Liu and his men ambush the pair: the fight is, however, a fake. Further on, they are attacked again, but this time their assailants are apparently for real: Jin and Mei battle for their lives, being saved only by the intervention of an unseen knife-thrower. Furious, Jin confronts Liu: Liu explains that he has reported the matter up the chain of command and his general has taken over the pursuit. Jin realizes that he is now expendable.
Once again, Jin and Mei are attacked by the General's men. They are hopelessly outnumbered; at the last minute they are saved when the House of Flying Daggers reveal themselves. Jin and Liu are captured and taken to their headquarters. At this point, a number of surprising revelations are made. Mei is not blind, nor is she the old leader's daughter - she was merely pretending to be. Liu is in fact an undercover agent for the House of Flying Daggers, which has engineered the whole chain of events in order to draw the General into a decisive battle. Furthermore, Liu is in love with Mei: he has waited for three years for her whilst working undercover.
Mei, however, cannot bring herself to love Liu: over the last few days she has fallen for Jin. But as Jin is now a liability, she is ordered by Nia, the leader of the House of Flying Daggers, to kill him. Instead Mei takes him away then frees him from his bonds before they make love in the field. Jin then begs Mei to flee with him, but she is torn between her love and her duty to the House, as well as guilt over Liu; Jin leaves alone.
Mei finally decides to ride after Jin, but is ambushed by Liu who is embittered by her rejection and consumed by jealousy for Jin. Mei, not realizing that Liu has thrown two daggers stuck together, only manages to ward off one before the other strikes her in the chest. As Mei lies dying, Jin returns to find Liu, and they begin an epic battle of honor and revenge, fighting from autumn to winter. Mei, regaining consciousness, grabs the dagger in her chest and threatens to pull it out and to throw it in order to kill Liu if Liu kills Jin with his throwing dagger; in doing so Mei would sacrifice her own life, as it would enable the blood to flow and cause her to bleed to death. Jin begs her not to do it, willing to die rather than let her be killed. Infuriated, Liu throws his arm out as if to throw a knife at Jin, leading Mei to rip the dagger out of her own heart and throw it, not at Liu but instead in an attempt to deflect Liu's attack and save Jin. However, all her dagger does is deflect a droplet of blood, as Liu never let go of his dagger. Liu stumbles off into the blizzard as a grief-stricken Jin holds Mei's lifeless body, singing the song originally sung by Mei at the beginning of the film in the Peony Pavilion.","exciting,stylized,atmospheric,captivating",2957.jpg,2004-05-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/house-of-flying-daggers/id292965574?uo=4,AaOO2oork7A,,,"Action & Adventure,Art House & International,Drama"

3052,How Weed Won the West,"Filmmaker Kevin Booth (American Drug War) offers this documentary that chronicles the exploding popularity of medical marijuana dispensaries in California and the mixed response from law enforcement agencies. Focusing on the controversial story of Organica, a legal Los Angeles pot club that was raided in 2009, the film also includes insights from a range of medical marijuana advocates, including a former LAPD cop.","With California and the rest of the country going bankrupt, one business is booming. 'How Weed Won the West' is the story of the growing Medical Marijuana industry, focusing on Los Angeles with over 700 legal dispensaries doling out the buds. Following the story of Organica, a southland dispensary which was raided by state and federal agencies in August of 2009, the film shows that although much has changed with Obama in office, the drug war is nowhere near over. Kevin Booth, producer/director of American Drug War, picks up where the last film left off and continues his fight against the hypocrisy of the War on Drugs. Intended to inform and entertain, this fast paced and even sometimes funny film features Texas conspiracy guru Alex Jones, Ethan Nadelmann head of Drug Policy Alliance, and a host of amazing characters including a former LAPD narcotics officer who now thinks all drugs should be legal. Even to someone who has not consumed weed in decades, this film definitely opens anyone's eyes concerning the detrimental economic, social and human ramifications created by marijuana prohibition. It takes the viewer through a journey of real life stories involving the relatively new California legal marijuana industry using a refreshing angle which does not focus strictly on the medicinal value of marijuana. The widespread responsible consumption of marijuana for personal recreation and mood enhancement is addressed as well.

3311,How to Train Your Dragon,"How to Train Your Dragon Synopsis: A winner with audiences and critics alike, DreamWorks Animation‚Äö√Ñ√¥s HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON rolls fire-breathing action, epic adventure and laughs into a captivating and original story. Hiccup is a young Viking who defies tradition when he befriends one of his deadliest foes a ferocious dragon he calls Toothless. Together, the unlikely heroes must fight against all odds to save both their worlds.","The island of Berk is a Viking village that is plagued by attacks from dragons. Hiccup, the awkward son of the village chieftain, Stoick the Vast, shoots down a dragon he thinks may be a Night Fury, a rare dragon nobody has ever actually seen. Hiccup locates the dragon in the forest, but finds he is unable to kill the helpless animal. Hiccup instead cuts it free. Meanwhile, Stoick assembles a fleet to seek out the dragons' nest, but before he leaves, he places Hiccup in dragon-killing classes taught by Gobber, the village blacksmith.
Searching the forest, Hiccup finds the dragon trapped in a shallow glade; the dragon's tail was injured, preventing it from flying normally. Hiccup discovers a way to earn the dragon's trust and begins to care for it. He names the Night Fury ""Toothless"", for its retractable teeth. Later, Hiccup fashions a makeshift harness and prosthetic tail that allows him to guide the dragon in free flight. Hiccup is able to transfer his knowledge of dragons to the other species of dragons at school, appearing to conquer each one in battle and becoming the star pupil, much to the dismay of Astrid, a girl in dragon training on whom Hiccup has a crush. Eventually Hiccup completes the class and gets the chance to kill a dragon in front of the entire village. Meanwhile, the battered Viking fleet arrives home.
Later, Astrid follows Hiccup, and is shocked to discover Toothless. She attempts to escape to tell the rest of the village, but Hiccup takes her for a ride on Toothless. At first, Astrid is terrified, but then begins to enjoy the excursion, but then Toothless unexpectedly joins a flock of dragons and takes the pair straight into the dragon's nest, where they discover that the Red Death, a gigantic dragon, depends on the food they bring back or else it feeds on the dragons themselves. Astrid wants to tell the village of the nest, but Hiccup wants to keep it a secret to protect Toothless. Astrid agrees. Before she heads back, she punches his arm for kidnapping her, and then kisses him on the cheek for ""everything else"".
Hiccup is put to his final exam the next day by fighting a Monstrous Nightmare, but when he tries to show the village the dragon's true nature, Stoick stops the fight, inadvertently angering the dragon and endangering Hiccup. Toothless hears Hiccup's scream and flies in to save him, but is captured himself. Hiccup, attempting to explain his actions, reveals how to find the dragons' nest. He tries to warn his father of the danger, but Stoick refuses to listen to his son, demotes Hiccup from being a Viking, disowns him, and leaves with another fleet, using a restrained Toothless as their guide. Hiccup then concocts a plan to save the Vikings.
The teens arrive when the Viking fleet has already discovered the Red Death. Hiccup's classmates distract it while Hiccup attempts to free Toothless. Hiccup and Toothless almost drown, but both are saved by Stoick. Hiccup and Toothless lure the Red Death into flight, ultimately damaging its wings and then forcing it into an inescapable dive back to earth, killing it in a massive explosion. While attempting to flee from the crashing dragon, Hiccup falls and Toothless dives into the flames after him.
Stoick finds Toothless, who reveals an unconscious Hiccup safely wrapped in his wings. Hiccup wakes up back on Berk. As he leaves his bed, he discovers part of his left leg has been replaced by a prosthetic leg made by Gobber. His grief is turned to joy, however, as he steps outside to find the Vikings and dragons working together to rebuild their village. He is greeted by everyone, and Astrid rushes to kiss him. The film ends with the war between Vikings and Dragons finally over with Hiccup and his friends racing their dragons.","exciting,sentimental,pet,trust,joy,friendship,feel good,humorous,atmospheric,anticipation,friend",3311.jpg,2010-03-18, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/how-to-train-your-dragon/id386717154?uo=4,IT_ufPxiXl8,70109893,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/How_to_Train_Your_Dragon/70109893,"Animation,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
1741,Hugo,"Welcome to a magical world of spectacular adventure! When wily and resourceful Hugo discovers a secret left by his father, he unlocks a mystery and embarks on a quest that will transform those around him and lead to a safe and loving place he can call home. Academy Award¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫-winning filmmaker Martin Scorsese invites you to experience a thrilling journey that critics are calling ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†¬¥the stuff that dreams are made of.‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂≈ì√Ñ *Peter Travers, ROLLING STONE","In 1931, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a 12-year-old boy living in the walls of the Paris Gare Montparnasse railway station, where he tends the station's clocks. Previously, he was raised by his widowed father, a museum worker (Jude Law). His father had doted on Hugo, teaching him the art of repairing mechanical devices, taking him to movies, and showing him how he was repairing an automaton (mechanical man) that supposedly could write a message. After his father was killed in a museum fire Hugo was taken in by his alcoholic Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone) who showed little sentiment for Hugo but taught the boy how to maintain the clocks at the station. When Claude disappears, Hugo continues to maintain the clocks while eking out a living by stealing food and supplies. All the while Hugo lives in fear that if the vigilant Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) were to discover him, he would be turned over to an orphanage.
Hugo continues the work on the automaton. Relying on his father's notebook for insight, he steals the required parts wherever he can, including from the shop of a toymaker who makes and sells mechanical toys. One day, he is finally caught by the bitter toymaker, Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), who has long known that Hugo robs him. Georges looks through Hugo's father's notebook, is evidently strongly affected by it, and keeps it despite Hugo's protests. Hugo is forced to trail Georges to his home to retrieve it. There, he meets Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chlo‚àö¬¥ Grace Moretz), who promises to help.
At the station on the following day Georges gives some ashes to Hugo, referring them as the remains of the notebook. Later, Isabelle tells him that the notebook was not burnt, adding that the notebook has somehow deeply disturbed her Papa Georges. Finally, Georges tells Hugo that he may earn his notebook back if he works in the toy store every day to pay for all the items Hugo stole. During his free time, Hugo continues to work on the automaton. When it is finished, however, it is still missing one part: a heart-shaped key that goes into the back of the automaton to make it work.
As the two grow close together, Hugo takes Isabelle to the movies, something that Georges would never let her do, while she introduces him to a bookstore owner (Christopher Lee) who has loaned her books in the past.


A Georges M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs drawing similar to the one drawn by the automaton in the film
Hugo is surprised to find that Isabelle wears a heart-shaped key as a necklace. He asks to borrow it, but Isabelle refuses to lend the key to Hugo unless he tells her why he needs it. At first Hugo declines, but his desire to see the automaton operate eventually leads him to take Isabelle to see the automaton. They use the key to start the automaton, and watch as it draws out an iconic image from the film Voyage to the Moon by the film pioneer Georges M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs. When the automaton writes a signature beneath the drawing, Isabelle recognizes the name as her godfather's own. They take the drawing to Georges' home for an explanation. They ask Isabelle's godmother Mama Jeanne (Helen McCrory) but she will not tell them anything. As Georges arrives home, Jeanne forces the children into a back room, where they find a hidden compartment in an armoire. In the compartment is a small chest containing a copy of the automaton's drawing, along with many other drawings. The noise of a collapsing chair draws Georges into the room, and he throws Hugo out, feeling betrayed.
Some time later, Hugo and Isabelle discuss M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs with the bookstore owner; he directs them to the library, telling them just where they may find a book on the history of film. As they read the book, its author, Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg), appears and describes his love for M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs's work. The book asserts that M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs died during World War I, but the children convince Tabard that the filmmaker is still alive. Tabard reveals he has the last known copy of Voyage, and Hugo suggests that they go to the Georges' house to watch it the next evening. That night, Hugo has a dream where he finds a golden heart-shaped key lying on a railbed in the station but is run over by an approaching train and his dream ends with images of the Gare Montparnasse accident of 1895.
The next evening, Jeanne is hesitant about letting them show the film until Tabard recognizes her as Jeanne d'Alcy, a frequent and beautiful actress in many of M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs' films. When the film finishes, Georges comes out, and emotionally reveals himself to be M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs, recalling his filmmaking career. He transformed his illusionist skills into the special effects he used for his movies to bring his vivid imagination to life. However, with the onset of World War I, his films lost popularity with a war-weary population, and he became ruined, selling the films to be melted down to chemicals, used to mold shoe heels, and quietly disappeared as a toy maker to sustain himself and Jeanne. Georges is despondent, believing all of his former film materials were otherwise destroyed in a museum fire, leading Hugo to recall the automaton.
Hugo races back to the station to get the automaton (intending to use it as a surprise for Georges), but before he can retrieve it, he is discovered by the Station Inspector who reveals that Claude's body had been discovered in the River Seine. The Inspector now knows Hugo is an orphan. During the ensuing chase, Hugo climbs up the clock tower and is forced to climb onto the clock hands to hide from the Inspector. When he goes away, Hugo quickly climbs back in and gets the automaton but is quickly cornered again by the Inspector and the automaton is thrown onto the railway tracks. Despite the approach of an oncoming train, Hugo jumps onto the tracks to recover the automaton. With no time to climb back up onto the platform to save himself and the automaton, Hugo appears to face certain death from the oncoming train. However, the Inspector saves Hugo at the last moment. As the Inspector decides whether or not to arrest Hugo, Georges arrives and asserts that Hugo is now in his care. Hugo presents the automaton to Georges.
Sometime later, a film festival is held showcasing over eighty recovered and restored M‚àö¬©li‚àö¬Æs films. Georges tearfully takes the stage, and thanks Hugo for his dedication and to the other attendees for sharing his imagination with him. After the festival, in the Georges' house, Hugo has acclimated as Georges' son, while Isabelle begins writing a book on the recent events. The film ends on a shot of the automaton sitting at a writing desk in a pleasant room, posed as though prepared to resume drawing.",,1741.jpg,2011-10-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/hugo/id496709723?uo=4,hR-kP-olcpM,70202136,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Hugo/70202136,"Kids & Family,Mystery & Suspense"

","Comedian and filmmaker Jordan Brady offers an inside look at the art and business of stand-up comedy in this documentary. In I Am Comic, more than eighty professional comedians -- ranging from struggling beginners to veterans with over a fifty years of experience -- talk about the nuts and bolts of their work, discussing how they create their material, how an act comes together over time, the rigors of performing and their relationship with their audience. The film also focuses on one particular performer, Ritch Shydner. During the 1980s, Shydner was a working comedian who seemed poised for a major breakthrough -- he appeared on a number of top talk shows (including Johnny Carson, Jay Leno and David Letterman), he had his own special on HBO, he appeared on several situation comedies as a guest star and starred in several pilots for comedy shows built around him. Despite it all, Shydner never hit the big time, and he eventually quit touring to become a writer for television. After more than a decade away from the stage, Shydner is hoping to make a comeback, and Brady follows him as he tries to connect with a new audience and adjusts to the changing landscape of professional comedy.

88,I Met the Walrus,"ACADEMY AWARD NOMINEE, BEST ANIMATED SHORT FILM
In 1969, 14-year-old Jerry Levitan snuck into ex-Beatle John Lennon's hotel room. Instead of kicking him out or having him arrested, Lennon agreed to let Levitan interview him. Flash-forward 38 years. Josh Raskin, a Canadian filmmaker with an affinity for appropriating old things and reupholstering them in terrifying new ways, uses the interview as the basis for a short film. With brilliant pen work by James Braithwaite and masterful digital illustration by Alex Kurina, the result is a spellbinding vessel for Lennon‚Äö√Ñ√¥s boundless wit and timeless message.

3413,I've Loved You So Long,"Follows Juliette, who after 15 years in prison returns to her hometown of Nancy. When she is reunited with her younger sister Lea, with whom she stays, Juliette finds herself imprisoned by another pain and secret. Meanwhile, Lea seems to lead a happy, calm and ""normal"" life with her husband Luc, two young daughters, many friends and an exciting job. Although siblings, Juliette and Lea are complete strangers to each other.","When Juliette Fontaine, formerly a doctor, is released from prison, her younger sister L‚àö¬©a invites her to stay with her family ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ including her husband, his mute father, and their two adopted Vietnamese daughters ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ in their home in the university town of Nancy in Lorraine. Why Juliette was in prison is revealed slowly throughout the film: first, that she was in prison for 15 years, then that her crime was murder, then that the victim was her 6-year-old son Pierre, and finally the reason why she killed him.
L‚àö¬©a, a college professor of literature, is considerably younger than Juliette. Because of the nature of Juliette's crime, their parents denied Juliette's existence and refused to allow L‚àö¬©a to visit her. In addition, Juliette had refused to speak throughout her trial. As a result, L‚àö¬©a knows nothing about the circumstances surrounding the crime and, when pressed for details, Juliette refuses to discuss what happened until the end of the film.
While struggling to find employment, Juliette enjoys platonic companionship with two men, a probation officer who understands how prison can damage the human spirit, and Michel, one of L‚àö¬©a's colleagues, who is sympathetic to her ordeal of having been imprisoned.
Gradually, Juliette begins to fit in with L‚àö¬©a and her family, makes friends, and finds a permanent job as a secretary at a hospital. She also develops a close relationship with her young nieces, much to the distress of their father, who is concerned about their safety while in their aunt's presence. Slowly, after seeing how she interacts with the family, he begins to accept her.
Juliette agrees to accompany L‚àö¬©a on a visit to their mother, who is confined to a nursing home with Alzheimer's disease. For a brief moment the woman recognizes and embraces her, remembering her as a little girl rather than the estranged daughter who murdered her grandson.
L‚àö¬©a accidentally discovers a clue to why Juliette killed Pierre. Juliette diagnosed her son as suffering from a fatal and painful disease. L‚àö¬©a confronts Juliette with what she learned, and Juliette explains that, when Pierre's condition progressed so that he could barely move, Juliette killed him with an injection, knowing that otherwise he would suffer unbearable pain. At trial she spoke no word of defense or explanation, feeling that she deserved punishment for bringing her son into the world, condemned to die. After a cathartic, emotional scene between the two sisters, Lea looks at a window and comments on how beautiful the rain is. Juliette agrees, and the film ends with Juliette saying, ""I am here.""",,3413.jpg,2008-03-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/ive-loved-you-so-long/id303434022?uo=4,AlMPS_qcRaM,,,"Art House & International,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
359,"I, Robot","In the year 2035, technology and robots are a trusted part of everyday life, but not for robo-phobic police detective Del Spooner (Will Smith). While investigating the apparent suicide of a renowned robot designer, detective Spooner teams with robo-psychologist Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan) and a prototype robot with human emotions to thwart a worldwide revolution designed to overthrow human rule.","In 2035, anthropomorphic robots enjoy widespread use as servants for various public services. They are programmed with the Three Laws of Robotics directives:
First Law: A robot must never harm a human being or, through inaction, allow any harm to come to a human.
Second Law: A robot must obey the orders given to them by human beings, except where such orders violate the First Law.
Third Law: A robot must protect its own existence unless this violates the First or Second Laws.
Del Spooner (Will Smith) is a Chicago detective. Years prior, he was saved from drowning by a robot after a car accident sent him and a 12-year-old girl named Sarah into a river. The girl was not saved, as the robot computed that he had a higher probability of survival (Spooner had 45% chance of survival, while Sarah only had 11%). After the incident, his badly damaged left arm and his left lung were replaced with a robotic prosthetic, which is substantially stronger than an organic arm, but virtually identical to it. Still haunted by the incident, Spooner now harbors a strong distaste for robots and the advancement of technology; he is certain that a human would have saved the girl if one had been in a position to make the same choice. He detoriated from the accident, also resulting in his divorce.
One day, Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell), the co-founder of U.S. Robotics (USR) and its main roboticist, dies after falling several stories from his office window. His death is called a suicide, but Spooner, who knew Lanning as both a friend and the creator of his robotic arm, believes otherwise. With the help of robopsychologist Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan), he interrogates employees at USR, including the other co-founder and CEO Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood) about his possibility of suicide, and the supercomputer V.I.K.I (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) (Fiona Hogan), the building's main computer system, about his death. He also speaks with Lanning via his holographic projection, with the message explaining that the real question is why would Lanning kill himself.
Spooner investigates Lanning's office, and determines that a man of Lanning's age could not have broken through the security windows. He also finds a copy of Hansel and Gretel on the table. Searching the lab, he suddenly activates a prototype of the latest USR model, the NS-5, which suddenly flees and refuses to respond to Spooner's orders to stop, violating the Second Law. Spooner and Calvin chase the rogue machine to an assembly factory and the police capture it. The robot refuses to respond but insists they call it ""Sonny"". Lt. John Bergin (Chi McBride) debriefs Spooner and recommends he drop the case, but this only serves to pique Spooner's interest more. As Spooner continues to investigate, his life is threatened by several USR robots ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ one attack only being thwarted thanks to Spooner's artificial arm ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ but these are all dismissed as equipment malfunctions.
Spooner learns that Lanning was a virtual prisoner in his office, unable to leave it and has created messages to leave clues to the true situation. Spooner and Calvin speak further to Sonny, learning he has been designed with the ability to override the Three Laws and ignore orders; Sonny also describes a dream he has of Spooner standing before thousands of robots, apparently as their savior. Sonny is ordered to be destroyed by injecting nanites into his positronic brain, but Calvin, unable to go through with it, fakes his destruction (replacing him with the unprocessed NS-5 model). Meanwhile, using Sonny's drawing of the vision, Spooner discovers the location, the now dried-up Lake Michigan that USR now uses as a storage area for older robot models. He also plays the last message from Lanning and discovers that the ""revolution"" is planned, the real question is whose. Spooner finds NS-5 robots destroying the older robots, and is barely able to escape himself, as he realizes that the robots are planning the revolution. The NS-5 robots soon take over the city and the whole U.S, imprisoning humans in their homes and enforcing a curfew.
Spooner regroups with Calvin and they sneak into the USR building with the help of Sonny. As they work their way in, they come to the conclusion that the NS-5s destroyed the older robots as they would attempt to protect the humans (Second Law). Believing Robertson to be behind the robot uprising, they find him in his office, strangled to death. Lanning's intent was to use Spooner's detestation of robots to have him follow the clues to point to the entity controlling the NS-5s: V.I.K.I. They confront V.I.K.I. who admits to her control, and has been trying to kill Spooner by tracking his actions through the city. As her artificial intelligence grew, she had determined that humans were too self-destructive, and created an additional law, stating that robots are to protect humanity even if the First or Second Laws are disobeyed, even if it meant killing some of the people, as part of the NS-5 directives.
Spooner and Calvin realize they cannot reason with V.I.K.I., and further convince Sonny of the same, Sonny concluding that V.I.K.I.'s plan, while logical, is ""too heartless"". Sonny retrieves the nanites so they can use them to wipe V.I.K.I's core, located at the center of the USR building. As they reach the core, V.I.K.I. sends armies of NS-5s to attack them. The NS-5s cause Calvin to fall and Spooner yells at Sonny to save her despite the low probability of success and the ""greater logical"" importance to destroy V.I.K.I with the nanites, but in the end, Sonny creatively throws the nanites in the air trusting Spooner to grab them while he saves Calvin. Spooner is able to grab the nanites and inject them into V.I.K.I. Within seconds, V.I.K.I. is wiped out, and the NS-5s revert to their natural servitude programming.
Spooner realizes that Lanning purposely asked Sonny to kill him, since Lanning was V.I.K.I's prisoner, and that suicide was the only message that he could send to him, as Spooner notes ""first bread crumb"". The government orders the NS-5s decommissioned to the site in Lake Michigan, while Spooner clears Sonny of Lanning's murder, arguing that 'murder' is defined as one human killing another and Sonny is therefore innocent. In the movie's closure, Sonny is seen on the hill at Lake Michigan, as in his vision, with the other NS-5 robots looking to him for guidance.","audi,technology,designer,soul,robot,prototype,tech,usrobotics,human,emotion,emotional,future,emotions,spirit,usr,intuitive",359.jpg,2004-07-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/i-robot/id271873831?uo=4,s0f3JeDVeEo,,,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

The exceptions are a woolly mammoth named Manfred, and a terminally lazy sloth named Sid (John Leguizamo). When Sid ""adopts"" Manfred (Ray Romano) as his protector, the mammoth tries everything he can to unload his newfound baggage. But that's only the beginning of his frustrations: Manny has been roped by Sid into helping reunite an abandoned human baby named Roshan (Goran Visnjic) with his family.

As Sid, Manny and Diego make their way across the vast, ice-covered landscape, another creature, a prehistoric squirrel/rat known as Scrat, tries desperately to carry out his mission in life - to bury an acorn - which, alas, triggers calamitous events.","Back when the Earth was being overrun by glaciers, and animals were scurrying to save themselves from the upcoming Ice Age, a sloth named Sid, a woolly mammoth named Manny, and a saber-toothed tiger named Diego are forced to become unlikely heroes.

Juliet Stevenson narrates this documentary account of the life of composer Ludwig von Beethoven, covering all the major highlights from his birth in 1770 through his death in 1827.

But when the relationship takes a sudden and tragic turn, the Fowlers are forced to confront the harsh reality of their situation and the inescapable consequences of their actions.","The film is set in the Mid-Coast town of Camden, Maine. Dr. Matt Fowler (Tom Wilkinson) and Ruth Fowler (Sissy Spacek) enjoy a happy marriage and a good relationship with their son Frank (Nick Stahl), a recent college graduate who has come home for the summer. Frank has fallen in love with an older woman with children, Natalie Strout (Marisa Tomei). Frank is also applying to graduate school for architecture, but is considering staying in town to work in the fishing industry and be near to Natalie. Natalie's ex-husband, Richard Strout (William Mapother), whose family owns a local fish-processing and delivery business, is violent and abusive. Richard actively tries to find a way into his ex-wife and son's lives, going to increasingly violent lengths to get his intentions across to Natalie. Ruth is openly concerned about Frank's relationship with Natalie, while Matt sees past his wife's worries.
Midway through the film, Richard kills Frank during a confrontation at Natalie's house, following a domestic dispute. Though equally devastated, Matt and Ruth grieve in different ways with Matt putting on a brave face while Ruth becomes reclusive and quiet. Richard is set free on bail, paid by his well-to-do family, and both Matt and Ruth are forced to see Richard around town. The tension between the pair increases when they learn that the lack of a direct witness to their son's shooting allows the killer to avoid murder charges, since the district attorney may have difficulty proving that Richard killed Frank intentionally, as opposed to accidental manslaughter in a struggle which defense attorney Marla Keyes (Karen Allen) argues. The silence between the couple erupts in an argument where each is confronted with the truth about each parent's relationship with their son: Ruth was overbearing and Matt let him get away with everything. With the strain between them broken, the couple is finally able to find a common ground in their grief. However, both realize that the court will not bring the justice to Richard that he deserves.
Unable to live with Richard walking free and determined to heal himself and his wife, Matt abducts and kills Richard. He and a friend dispose of the body in the woods. Matt returns home to Ruth, who waits for him patiently. Ruth goes to make coffee and Matt pulls a band-aid from his finger, showing that he is finally ready to heal from the tragedy of his son's death on his own.","bleak,sincere,contemplative",2181.jpg,2001-12-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/in-the-bedroom/id432513150?uo=4,vbgETu4NH_Y,,,"Art House & International,Drama"

Saito reveals, after Cobb's and Arthur's associate sells them out, that he was actually auditioning the team to perform the difficult act of inception: implanting an idea into a person's subconscious while they sleep.
Saito wishes to break up the energy conglomerate of his ailing competitor Maurice Fischer, by planting the idea in his son and heir Robert Fischer to disintegrate his father's company. Should Cobb succeed, Saito would use his influence to clear a murder charge against Cobb, so he can return to the United States and his children. Cobb accepts the offer and assembles his team: Eames, a conman and identity forger; Yusuf, a chemist who concocts the powerful sedative for a stable dream within a dream strategy; Ariadne, an architecture student tasked with designing the labyrinth of the dream landscapes; and Arthur. Saito accompanies so that he knows whether or not Cobb and his team succeeded.
When the elder Fischer dies in Sydney and his body is flown back to Los Angeles, the team share the flight with Robert Fischer and Cobb sedates him, bringing him into the shared dream. At each stage, the member of the team generating the dream stays behind to initiate the ""kick"", while the other members sleep within the dream to travel a level deeper. In the first level, Yusuf's rainy downtown dream, the team abducts Fischer. However Fischer's trained subconscious projections attack and severely wound Saito. Eames temporarily takes the appearance of Fischer's godfather, Peter Browning, to suggest Fischer reconsider his father's will. Yusuf drives the team in a van as they are sedated into Arthur's dream, a hotel, where the team recruit Fischer, convincing him his kidnapping was orchestrated by Browning. In the third dream level, a snowy mountain fortress dreamed by Eames, Fischer is told they are in Browning's subconscious, but they are really going deeper into Fischer's. Yusuf, under assault by trained projections, initiates his kick too soon by driving off a bridge, sending Arthur's dream world into zero-gravity and causing an avalanche in Eames' dream. Arthur improvises a new kick using an elevator that will be synchronized with the van hitting the water, while the team in Eames' dream races to finish the job before the new round of kicks.
Due to the effects of heavy sedation and multi-layered dreaming, death during this mission will result in entering Limbo, dream space of unknown content where the dreamer could be trapped. Elapsed time in each dream level is roughly twenty times greater than in the level above it; in Limbo, the deepest level of all, 24 hours of outer-world time would be experienced as about half a century. Cobb reveals to Ariadne that he spent ""fifty years"" with Mal in Limbo constructing a world from their shared memories whilst seemingly growing old together. After returning to the waking world, Mal remained convinced she was still dreaming and committed suicide, trying to persuade Cobb to do so by retroactively incriminating him in her death. He fled the U.S. and left his children behind, ostensibly in the care of his father-in-law.
Saito succumbs to his wounds, and Cobb's projection of Mal sabotages the plan by killing Fischer, sending them both into Limbo.[15] Cobb and Ariadne enter Limbo to find Fischer and Saito, while Eames remains on his dream level to set up a kick by rigging the fortress with explosives. Cobb confronts his projection of Mal, who tries convincing him to stay in Limbo. Cobb refuses and confesses that he was responsible for Mal's suicide: having convinced her to leave Limbo by using inception to plant the idea in her mind that the world they had been living in for fifty years was not real, and hence the need to kill themselves in order to return to the real world, once back in the real world she continued to believe dying would wake her. Mal attacks Cobb but Ariadne shoots her. Through his confession, Cobb attains catharsis and chooses to remain in Limbo to search for Saito. Ariadne pushes Fischer off a balcony, bringing him back up to the mountain fortress, where he enters a safe room to discover and accept the planted idea: that his father wishes him to be his ""own man"", and that splitting up the conglomerate might not be a radical notion.
All of the team members except Cobb and Saito ride the synchronized kicks back to reality: Ariadne jumps off a balcony in Limbo, Eames detonates the explosives in the fortress, Arthur blasts an elevator containing the team's sleeping bodies up an elevator shaft, and the van in Yusuf's dream hits the water. Cobb eventually finds an aged Saito and the two remember their arrangement, presumably killing themselves and awakening to outer-world reality on the airplane. Saito honors the arrangement and Cobb passes through U.S. customs once the plane lands in Los Angeles. Before reuniting with his children, Cobb tests reality with his spinning top, but he turns away to greet them before observing the results.","dreams,inception,stylized,captivating,real,time,espionage,spin,fake,trick,anticipation,steal,dream,trust,tense,mind bending,sleep,reality,exciting,dimension,suspenseful,secrets,secret,clever,dream in a dream,fear",3522.jpg,2010-07-08, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/inception/id400763833?uo=4,8hP9D6kZseM,70131314,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Inception/70131314,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
3470,Independence Day,"Celebrate 75 Years of Independence with 20th Century Fox! On July 2nd, communications systems worldwide are sent into chaos by a strange atmospheric interference. First thought to be meteors, they are later revealed to be gigantic spacecraft, piloted by a mysterious alien species who have set out to launch an attack throughout the globe. On July 3rd, the aliens all but obliterate New York, Los Angeles, and Washington when a band of survivors devise a plan to fight back against the enslaving aliens. On July 4th, humanity fights for its freedom.","On July 2, an enormous alien ship enters Earth's orbit and deploys 36 smaller saucer-shaped ships, each 15 miles wide, which position themselves over major cities around the globe. David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), a satellite technician for a television network in Manhattan, discovers transmissions hidden in satellite links that he realizes the aliens are using to coordinate an attack. David and his father Julius (Judd Hirsch) travel to the White House and warn his ex-wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano (Margaret Colin), and President Thomas J. Whitmore (Bill Pullman) of the attack. The President, his daughter, portions of his Cabinet and the Levinsons narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the alien spacecraft destroy Washington D.C., New York City, Los Angeles and other cities around the world.
Meanwhile, USMC Captain Steven Hiller (Will Smith) is part of a counterattack against the ships. His girlfriend Jasmine Dubrow (Vivica A. Fox), her son, Dylan Dubrow (Ross Bagley), and their pet dog survive the destruction of Los Angeles. The next day, July 3, Jasmine commandeers an abandoned maintenance truck to drive to Hiller's military base. Along the way, she picks up several survivors and also finds the injured First Lady (Mary McDonnell), who had been flying out of Los Angeles by helicopter when it was knocked down in the alien attack.
Captain Hiller leads a squadron of F/A-18 Hornets on a sortie against the spaceship over Los Angeles. The ships are found to be guarded by force fields that repel any attack, and they also release fighters armed with similar shields and weaponry. After the rest of his squadron is annihilated in a one-sided dogfight, Hiller captures an alien pilot after luring an alien fighter to the Grand Canyon,[4] then causing it to crash into the canyon walls. While dragging the unconscious alien across the desert, Hiller is picked up by a ragtag group of refugees driving campers and trucks to a nearby military base. The group includes Russell Casse (Randy Quaid), an alcoholic crop-duster who claims to have been abducted by aliens years earlier.
The refugees take the captured alien to Area 51, where Air Force One has already landed. Area 51 conceals a top secret facility housing a recovered spacecraft and alien bodies stored since the Roswell incident in 1947. The captured alien regains consciousness in a sealed lab and reveals that its species roams the galaxy, consuming planets' resources before moving on. The alien tries to psychically attack President Whitmore, but is killed by the base commander, Air Force officer Major Mitchell (Adam Baldwin). A nuclear attack against a shield protected ship over Houston results in failure. Captain Hiller, wanting to find Jasmine, steals a helicopter and travels back to his abandoned base where he finds Jasmine, the First Lady and other survivors. The President and his daughter, Patricia Whitmore (Mae Whitman), later visit the First Lady in the base hospital, where she eventually dies from her internal injuries.
On July 4, David devises a plan to use the 1947 spacecraft to sneak into the mothership and introduce a computer virus before detonating a nuclear weapon inside the ship. The computer virus will filter down to the smaller vessels, deactivating their shields; the plan is to simultaneously attack the 36 city ships once their shields are down. Hiller volunteers to be the pilot, since he is the only person to have seen them in action and survive, giving him unique knowledge of the ship's capabilities, and David decides he must go along to upload the virus. With few military pilots left, the President, a former fighter pilot, rallies the refugees and garners a number of volunteers, including Casse. Morse code is used to contact forces around the world in order to coordinate the attack.
After the virus is implanted and lowers the shields, Whitmore leads an attack against a ship approaching Area 51. Although the fighters damage the alien ship, they run out of missiles without inflicting critical damage. The ship prepares to fire its main weapon at Area 51. Casse has the last missile, but it jams. As his children are sheltering within the Area 51 base and would likely be killed by a successful firing of the aliens' main cannon, Russell sacrifices himself by ramming his fighter into the cannon just as it is about to fire and triggers a chain reaction that destroys the whole ship. Other forces around the world bring down the remaining destroyers using Casse's method.
David and Hiller are discovered in the mothership, but when they fire their nuclear weapon, their ship is freed and they escape with seconds to spare. The mothership is destroyed and the 1947 spacecraft crashes in the desert near Area 51, with David and Hiller emerging safe and sound from the wreckage. The world celebrates as the main characters watch debris from the mothership enter the atmosphere.","4thjuly,dc,virus,infectious,stylized,humorous,rough,aliens,exciting,washington,cold,suspenseful,alien abduction,infect,invasion,alien,anticipation,surprise,independenceday,fear",3470.jpg,1996-06-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/independence-day/id272967721?uo=4,nDNDQLP3bPI,60000363,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Independence_Day/60000363,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

3247,Inglourious Basterds,"Brad Pitt takes no prisoners in Quentin Tarantino‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s high-octane WWII revenge fantasy Inglourious Basterds. As war rages in Europe, a Nazi-scalping squad of American soldiers, known to their enemy as ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´The Basterds,‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ is on a daring mission to take down the leaders of the Third Reich. Bursting with ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´action, hair-trigger suspense and a machine-gun spray of killer dialogue‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ (Peter Travers, Rolling Stone), Inglourious Basterds is ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´another Tarantino masterpiece‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ (Jake Hamilton, CBS-TV)!","The signs were not good. 

After killjoying the exploitation film into submission with Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino looked like he was going to do to WW2 movies what Zed did to Marsellus Wallace in Pulp Fiction. 

A supposed remake of Enzo Castellari‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s 1978 Dirty Dozen rip-off with an eyebrow-raising cast (Mike Myers? Eli Roth?) and a worrying whiff of historical revisionism, Basterds could have ended up part indie Where Eagles Dare and part ultraviolent ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•Allo ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•Allo. 

In fact, the irrepressible iconoclast has pulled off a real coup, cramming his auteur obsessions (feet, food, films, Mexican stand-offs) into a triumphant ensemble piece that plays with artifice and authenticity, doing justice to both. 

Brad Pitt and his scalp-hunting mercenaries may be the poster boys, but they‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•re also a knowing exploitation clich‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬©, gleefully inserted into the convincing clash between plucky Jewish cinema owner Shosanna (M‚Äö√†√∂¬¨¬©lanie Laurent) and her chillingly courteous Nazi nemesis Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz, who won Best Actor at Cannes). 

For authenticity, the Euro-all-star cast (featuring alumni from Black Book and The Counterfeiters among others) speak in their mother tongues throughout, while Nazi film posters (examined in Elvis Mitchell‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s excellent featurette) both echo and subvert their historical inspirations. 

In terms of artifice, catchy nicknames (Waltz is ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚â§The Jew Hunter‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•, Roth, ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚â§The Bear Jew‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•) and in-jokes abound (two QT regulars have cheeky vocal cameos), Beethoven‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚â§F‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚à´r Elise‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬• battles Bowie, and the director‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s cinephilia sings from every frame. 

No jabber-track from Tarantino but a reasonable sprawl of extras. Veteran Aussie actor Rod Taylor (who plays Churchill) tells grandfatherly anecdotes, Castellari gets a featurette salute, Roth gets together with Goebbels (Sylvester Groth), three cut scenes add nothing but length, and an amiable round-table chat sees Tarantino describe WW2 as ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´the last time a whole bunch of white people killed a whole bunch of white people‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ. Meanwhile, Waltz declares: ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´Tarantino has killed the German Nazi film for all time‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ Or perhaps he‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s reinvented it. 

Switching expertly from comedy to drama, silliness to suspense, pulp to poetry, Basterds allows, in QT‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s words, a generation of Germans to ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´tap dance on the guilt‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ without the sensationalism some predicted (Hitler‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s rewritten fate notwithstanding‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë¬¨‚àÇ). 

Or, as original Bastard Bo Svensson says in fab film-within-a-film (and best extra) Nation‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•s Pride: ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚à´I‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬•m not going to be the son of a bitch responsible for turning [1,000 years of] history into dust!‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àöœÄ

7343,Kidulthood,"This isn't child's play. It's just another day in the inner city, where teenage growing pains can often lead to suicide, pregnancy and hot-blooded murder. So when classes are suspended after a bullied schoolgirl hangs herself rather than face another day of torment, a posse of unremorseful 15-year-olds take to the streets, where sex and drugs are a way of life and violence lurks behind every corner. Gritty, raw and brutally frank, Kidulthood is ""as potent as a shot of vodka before breakfast"" (Daily Mirror), a hardcore look at lost innocence and wasted youth.","A day in the life of a group of troubled 15-year-olds growing up in west London.

In Kidulthood's Britain, our teenagers are reckless hedonists, living for their moment under a whirl of as much sex, coke, blowjobs, weed and booze as they can cram into their ""Oh my days!"" lives. They're having a laugh. However, look behind the blurred sheen of peer-pressure narcotics and I-fell-asleep-during-sex-ed relationships and you'll find guns, baseball bats, muggings, booze and teen pregnancy. For these adolescents, you need to have a tragic experience to learn about the very notion of 'consequence'.

Based in West London, where rich and poor rub shoulder to shoulder, treading the same playgrounds in very differently priced shoes, Menhaj Huda's film opens in the local Comp. Bone-breakin', bloodied and unbowed, it's Grange Hill with guts as rival gangs tear into each other, leaving undeserving victim Katie (Rebecca Martin) so beaten up and distraught that, later that night, she's hung herself. With a day off school in her memory, the parents hope for reflection and remorse. As if.

Speaking a language alien to anyone born before 1990 and featuring a rare celluloid happy slapping, the 16-year-olds of Kidulthood (the title refers to that awkward phase when you're not a child, not yet a grown-up...) are their own, irreverent culture. Smashed on cocaine and grog, Alisa (Red Madrell) says of the unwanted baby growing inside her, ""I'd get so fat if I kept this,"" while her buddy Becky (Ray Winstone's daughter, Jamie) gives wealthy city boys head for drugs. Shot in guerrilla style, with cast and crew weaving through actual Oxford Street crowds, the film's immediacy (including ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫ Bout De Souffle-like passers-by eyeing up the camera) is striking. The actors, too - many of whom are making their cinematic bow - bring uncomfortable authenticity.

Ask whether the blame lies with the government, society or the parents, Kidulthood works just fine as a snapshot of Brit teen life. After seeing it, you'll never look at the kids on your bus in the same way again... Give them all ASBOs! An ultra-realist snapshot of Britain today, let down by a preachy ending, but maintained by its punchy dialogue and kids.

Moral salve? They're bad people, probably. Besides, it's time Jay ""got back on the horse.""

Anyone who saw jobbing TV director Ben Wheatley's 2009 feature debut Down Terrace - a galvanising mix of kitchen sink, soap, crime drama, Shakespearean tragedy and piss-taking comedy shot in eight days for ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨¬©¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬£6,000 - will go into his slippery sophomore effort with a toehold on what to expect.

Just don't be surprised if that toe is then hacked off and sent to you in the mail...

Set in a Sheffield that's dingy and banal yet infused with the mystic malignancy of the surrounding countryside, Kill List, like revenge, is best served cold.

Which means you should content yourself with a glance at the star rating and know only that it's a film you must discover for yourself. 

Can't resist? OK, we'll proceed with caution...

Kill List builds with nary a jar or jolt from naturalistic domestic drama to Grand Guignol horror movie via a succession of small-talk stakeouts culminating in grubbily violent hits.

It's also a mystery movie, a road movie and a grotesque riff on Arthurian legend, and is influenced as much by John Cassavetes, Alan Clarke and Ken Loach as Witchfinder General, The Wicker Man and The Blood On Satan's Claw. 

It doesn't stop there, either. Sift through the escalating carnage and you'll find a study of friendship, an examination of masculinity and some credible political asides.

Admittedly, after so much (re)invention, the final act emerges as something of a horror staple, and the savage climax is guessable - not least because it's nearly identical to that of a much lesser movie from last year (a case of strange quirk rather than pilfering).

But Wheatley negotiates the home straight with brute force and unwavering control, his mastery of mood and technique unleashing a visual and aural assault that's all the more shocking for the moments of eerie quietude and inappropriate politeness that punctuate the bloodlust.

When you're not screaming ""What the fuck?"" you'll be screaming, full stop.

Authentic dialogue, pitch-perfect performances and seductively scuzzy images comprise a film funny and bleak, tender and cruel, serious and 'out-there'. British horror has rarely hit these heights since the mid-'70s.

7240,Kill Your Darlings,,"A heady mix of sex, drugs and experimental literature, Daniel Radcliffe successfully breaks the shackles of Potter-esque typecasting with a blinding performance as young poet Allen Ginsberg in John Krokidas' dark, intoxicating indie.

Chronicling the birth of the Beat revolution and the true-life murder case that both estranged and inspired its founding members, Darlings follows Ginsberg's formative years as he enrols in Columbia University, meets fellow Beat writers William S. Burroughs (Ben Foster) and Jack Kerouac (Jack Huston), and embarks on a dangerously obsessive relationship with the charming yet troubled Lucien Carr (Chronicle's Dane DeHaan).

But the agreement turns complicated when Dottie forms a bond with Killer Joe and everything begins to unravel. Killer Joe is a controversial and shocking black comedy thriller from director William Friedkin (The Exorcist, The French Connection).","William Friedkin's darkly comic hitman thriller

Many thrillers claim to be sleazy and violent. This one genuinely was, as William Friedkin and Matthew McConaughey returned to form at exactly the same time, with nothing to prove and a desire to discomfort the audience.

Oh, to be privy to the conversation in which Kentucky Fried Chicken said yes to their product being subjected to an unspeakable atrocity at (or in, to be accurate) the hands of Matthew McConaughey. Without spoiling anything, let's just say that Gina Gershon and a piece of the Colonel's finest come out the worse for wear.

But a chicken leg isn't the only thing that gets defiled in William Friedkin's sordid adaptation of Tracy Letts' Texas-set play. That would be the entire trailer-trash sub-strata of American society. They might well live in a trailer but calling them trash is too charitable. They are depraved, bottom-feeding scum.

The plot sees Chris Smith (Emile Hirsch) hatch a plan to have his mother killed for her $50K life-insurance policy with help from his father Ansel (Thomas Haden Church), while his step-mum Sharla (Gershon) goes along with the scheme. They all believe that Chris' sister Dottie (Juno Temple) is the nasty crone's sole beneficiary.

And Dottie's not just the stooge, she's the guarantee, pimped out to Dallas 'tec and moonlighting hitman Killer Joe (McConaughey) until he gets his fee. If it sounds like time spent in unspeakably awful company, it is.

But you have to hand it to Friedkin: he's uncompromising in his vision, wringing every ounce of grime and salaciousness he can out of Killer Joe's plot and characters to create the dirtiest black comedy you'll see for a long time.

The US ratings board has slapped Joe with an NC-17 for _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•graphic aberrant content_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´. Our guess? Friedkin is rolling in the aisles at their consternation. Perhaps he should send them a bucket of KFC.

Friedkin's unflinching trailer-park noir features ugly characters, game performances, degradation and the obscene abuse of a chicken drumstick. Highly recommended, then.

7279,Killing Them Softly,,"The assassination of lowlife by the hitman Brad Pitt

After the ballad of The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford, Brad Pitt and Andrew Dominik tackle the blues in a downbeat thriller about a hitman grubbing about in the gutter of recession-hit America. A bold fusion of old-school crime tropes with contemporary political subtext, which reinforced the feeling that Pitt/Dominik might be the new Pitt/Fincher.

After their gorgeously eerie The Assassination Of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford whistled a mesmerising three-hour requiem for the legends of the Old West, you'd be right to expect Oz writer/director Andrew Dominik and producer/star Brad Pitt to unfurl another great US epic.

But weirdly, crime drama Killing Them Softly turns out to be a sawn-off oddity.

Adapted from 1974 bestseller Cogan's Trade, its stop-start story unpacks chewy, witty dialogue scenes that detonate in blasts of vivid violence.

We're back in the midst of the 2008 economic collapse and America's gangsters are suffering as much as America's businessmen.

It's mo' money, mo' problems for cool professional Jackie Cogan (Brad Pitt), who's hired to balance the books after lowlife punks Scoot McNairy (Monsters) and Ben Mendelsohn (Animal Kingdom) stick up a gambling den in a superbly tense, sweaty heist sequence.

But Cogan becomes increasingly and amusingly exasperated by an all-star cast of criminals who just can't take care of business.

Faded gangster Ray Liotta has used up his last chance and has to go. Mob accountant Richard Jenkins is all administrative faff. Pitt's best hitman James Gandolfini is now a bloated wreck, rinsed out by booze and whores.

Scuzzy street-junkie Mendelsohn and hapless McNairy are still on the loose. It's this terrific ensemble that offers real bang for your buck here Mendelsohn's skaghead Aussie is a brilliant creation as Dominik builds a grimy world of bad men, brutal violence and stylish cinematics.

He cranks down into slow-motion for a kill sequence of wrecked glass, pirouetting shell cases and blobs of gore; he dunks us inside Mendelsohn's heroin haze by fading in and out of trippy first-person blurs.

But then it ends, abruptly, and as the closing line lands heavily America's not a country, it's a business. Now fucking pay me, Killing Them Softly's supposed capitalist critique doesn't add up to much payback.

Dominik's bludgeoning attempts at satire seemingly every scene has Obama yakking on a TV in the background are too blunt to stomach.

Not quite as much, though, as one of the most staggeringly ruthless beatings you'll ever see on screen: poor Liotta, horribly pulverised on the street in his dressing gown, no less before chucking his guts up on one of his attacker's shoes.

Did we mention that Dominik reckons his film's a comedy? Yep, a real side-splitter.  

Verdict:

Tough, stylish, violent and studded with stars but like so many of its American gangsters, Killing Them Softly doesn't quite get the job done.

Starring Brad Pitt, Richard Jenkins, Scoot Mcnairy, Ray Liotta, James Gandolfini.

Now, Leona's Sister Gerri tells the powerful and thought-provoking story of the anonymous woman behind the image and how she became an extraordinary icon for the ever-controversial abortion issue. Through tears and laughter, Gerri Santoro's tale of desperation in the days before legal abortion ""unfolds in an intimate, unpretentious style"" (The New York Times) as told by her family and friends. Gerri was a tree climbing kid who grew up on the family farm, then a spirited adolescent, a young wife, and later the devoted mother of two little girls. But she was also a battered wife who suffered years of abuse before eventually leaving her husband and returning to Connecticut. There Gerri became pregnant by a lover who agreed to perform an abortion and then left her when the operation went awry. Nine years later, in 1973, Ms. magazine published the heart-wrenching photo, which even now cries out from protest placards as a potent symbol in the struggle for a woman's right to choose. Directed by Jane Gillooly, rousing and all-too-real, Leona's Sister Gerri cuts through the leaden rhetoric of one of America's most divisive issues to pay respects to an extraordinary woman and her tale.","Long ago, middle-aged Leona Gordon opened a Ms. magazine and saw the dead victim of a botched, illegal abortion. With a terrible shock she realized that the naked, blood-spattered corpse was her sister. This documentary examines the significance of the picture, and then offers a profile of the dead woman's life as told by Leona and her friends. Although shocking, the picture became an icon for pro-choice abortion activists. Her sister was Gerri Santoro born to a Connecticut farm family in the 1950s. She was pretty and vivacious and while in high school swore that she would find a husband before her best friend did. She ended up marrying Sebastian (Sam) Santoro and having two daughters by him. He was a violent-tempered man who frequently beat her. Later he moved his family to California in hopes that he could stop hurting her, but the abuse continued and Gerri finally took the children and returned to Connecticut. There she met and became sexually involved with the smooth-talking Clyde Dixon. She became pregnant, and because Sam was coming back for her, she decided to abort. But it was 1964 and abortions were illegal. It was Clyde who attempted to perform the operation in a motel room. By the time he finished, 28-year old Gerri was dead.","independent film,marital abuse,abortion",420.jpg,1/1/2007, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/leonas-sister-gerri/id280708477?uo=4,,70064255,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Leona_s_Sister_Gerri/70064255,Special Interest

1110,Letters from Iwo Jima,"Nominated for 4 Academy Awards including Best Picture, Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima tells the untold story of the Japanese soldiers who defended their homeland against invading American forces during World War II. With little defense other than sheer will and the volcanic rock of Iwo Jima itself, the unprecedented tactics of General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe, The Last Samurai) and his men transform what was predicted to be a swift defeat into nearly 40 days of heroic and resourceful combat. Their sacrifices, struggles, courage and compassion live on in the taut, gripping film Rolling Stone calls ""unique and unforgettable."" It is the powerful companion piece to Flags of Our Fathers.","The island of Iwo Jima stands between the American military force and the home islands of Japan. Therefore the Imperial Japanese Army is desperate to prevent it from falling into American hands and providing a launching point for an invasion of Japan. General Tadamichi Kuribayashi is given command of the forces on the island and sets out to prepare for the imminent attack. General Kuribayashi, however, does not favor the rigid traditional approach recommended by his subordinates, and resentment and resistance fester among his staff. In the lower echelons, a young soldier, Saigo, a poor baker in civilian life, strives with his friends to survive the harsh regime of the Japanese army itself, all the while knowing that a fierce battle looms. When the American invasion begins, both Kuribayashi and Saigo find strength, honor, courage, and horrors beyond imagination.","bleak,disturbing,sincere,suspenseful,contemplative,war,captivating",1110.jpg,12/9/2006, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/letters-from-iwo-jima/id305570626?uo=4,g65ewJJ1USc,70058006,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Letters_from_Iwo_Jima/70058006,Drama
3495,Letters to Juliet,"When aspiring magazine writer Sophia Marcus and would-be restauranteur Victor fly from New York to Italy for a vacation, the stage seems set for some much-needed romance in their relationship - especially since their destination is the city of Verona, home of the star-crossed lover Juliet Capulet of Romeo & Juliet fame. But Victor is far more interested in finding suppliers for his future restaurant than in wooing Sophia, who ends up getting a vicarious romantic fix from an unlikely source; she joins a group of volunteers who respond to letters that pour into Verona from around the world - letters to Juliet seeking advice about love. One such letter that Sophia responds to dates back to 1951 and came from one Claire Smith, an Englishwoman who fell in love with a young Italian man in her youth but let the opportunity slip away. To Sophia's surprise, her letter inspires Claire, now a grandmother, to travel to Verona in search of her long-lost love - accompanied by her grandson Charlie. With Victor wrapped up in his culinary quest, Sophia, Charlie and Claire scour the beautiful Italian countryside in search of Claire's long-lost love. In the process, romance blossoms in unexpected ways, eventually facing Sophia with the very advice she wrote in her letter to Claire. Will she find the courage to seize love or - like Claire - spend a lifetime regretting the road not taken?","An American girl discovers a love letter that changes her life in this romantic comedy starring Amanda Seyfried and Vanessa Redgrave.

7262,Liberal Arts,Josh Radnor & Elizabeth Olsen in a comic coming-of-age story about an unlikely romance between a jaded 35-year-old college counselor & a precocious 19-year-old student.,"The Movie: Writer/director Josh Radnor casts himself as the thirtysomething getting a premature mid-life crisis when he meets beguiling student Elizabeth Olsen, in the kind of talky, erudite rom-com (Before Sunrise, Garden State) that comes along once every few years.

Liberal Arts is a comedy. But when a movie opens with a quote from Ecclesiastes, you'd be forgiven for expecting a brow-furrowing drama laden with hefty intentions...

How I Met Your Mother star Josh Radnor's second movie as writer/director/actor (after 2010's Happythankyoumoreplease) is a cute, funny indie charmer, with a twist of sadcore wit that's just slightly too self-conscious.

Radnor plays a thirtysomething literature-lover who's been drifting through his adult life ever since graduating in English with a history minor.

But a return to university leads to a meet-cute with 19-year-old student Zibby (Elizabeth Olsen), who triggers romance, nostalgia and his late-bloom coming-of-age.

She's 19. He's 35.

He's done the maths. And Radnor's campus romcom is full of characters who feel nudged from their niche: adults who wish they were back at uni and students who wish they were out in the world.

It's witty and heartfelt but _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü perhaps a hangover from Radnor's sitcom style _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü too much of the dialogue feels written down and read out rather than spur-of-the- moment spoken.

Radnor's an easy actor to watch, mind, although not a patch on his glowing co-star.

Almost too good to be true, Olsen's the girl that shy, bookish guys only really meet in the movies.

Elsewhere, Zac Efron can't do much as a lazily written slacker full of equally meaningless life mantras.

But there's a much-needed pulse of reality from reluctant retiree Richard Jenkins and Allison Janney as an English professor who's sick of _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•effete, over-articulate manboys_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´.

7286,Life Of Pi,"Embark on the adventure of a lifetime in this visual masterpiece from Oscar¬¨¬®‚àö√ú Winner Ang Lee (Directing, Brokeback Mountain, 2005), based on the best-selling novel. After a cataclysmic shipwreck, young Pi Patel fi nds himself stranded on a lifeboat with only one other survivor ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö¬® a ferocious Bengal tiger named Richard Parker. Bound by the need to survive, the two are cast on an epic journey that must be seen to be believed.","A young man who survives a disaster at sea is hurtled into an epic journey of adventure and discovery. While cast away, he forms an unexpected connection with another survivor ... a fearsome Bengal tiger. Yann Martel's Booker prize-winner about an Indian boy marooned on a lifeboat with a tiger called Richard Parker gets the 'art-house blockbuster' treatment. Ang Lee spent four years working on this 3D CGI epic. It was worth every moment. 

Adaptations of supposedly unfilmable novels are currently arriving at a rate of knots from smart, audacious directors: Cosmopolis, On The Road, Midnight's Children, Cloud Atlas_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_

But leading the pack is Ang Lee's thrillingly conceived and executed take on Yann Martel's Booker Prize winner.

Cracking the most daunting literary codes has felled many an accomplished filmmaker, from Mike Nichols (Catch-22) to David Lynch (Dune).

What's more, the omens weren't looking good for Life Of Pi, with one auteur after another in the frame then out of it (M. Night Shyamalan, Alfonso Cuar‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ¬¢_n and Jean-Pierre Jeunet).

But then Lee arrived as a shining knight, wielding superior pixel power and warm-blooded empathy. The Taiwanese director - who's always had a knack for an adap (Sense And Sensibility, The Ice Storm, Brokeback Mountain) - has done handsome justice to Martel's spellbinding 2001 fable about one boy's supreme efforts to survive a tragic shipwreck.

Pi-hards will delight at Lee's strict devotion to Martel's prose, with only minor deviations to enrich the brew.

What he's engineered is a lush, liquid 3D masterwork that delivers one breath-snatching image after another, kicking off with French India's faded colonial grandeur and segueing into a tidal wave of marine magnificence: spectacular typhoons followed by turquoise serenity; the prodigiously-staged sinking of an animal-crammed freighter; a nighttime ocean aglow with luminescent sea-life_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_

Life Of Pi is a marvel of virtuoso cinematic artistry; it's also a riveting tale of adventure and endurance, Lee deftly integrating sombre themes into his ocean vistas.

Pi is portrayed by three actors. Newcomer Ayush Tandon is the Indian boy growing up in family-owned Pondicherry Zoo, who reveals how he acquired his bizarre name and arrived at his all-encompassing embrace of three religions: Hinduism, Christianity and Islam.

Slumdog Millionaire's Irrfan Khan is award-worthy as the Toronto-dwelling adult Pi, recounting his story in flashback to Martel (Rafe Spall) in Lee's most significant deviation from the source.

Last not least, bearing the brunt of the narrative, is Suraj Sharma as the teenage Pi, who leaves India for Canada with family and menagerie aboard the Japanese cargo ship Tsimtsum, only to watch it sink in a savage storm.

He's left to fight for survival aboard a lifeboat, his fellow castaways an injured zebra, an orang-utan, a hyena and a ferocious tiger whimsically named Richard Parker. (Needless to say, this unmerry band's numbers are swiftly whittled down.)

In his first acting role, Sharma proves to be both awesome discovery and mild disappointment.

The former because he rises valiantly to the challenge of bringing the resourceful Pi to life; the latter because Pi's emotive musings on subsistence and enlightenment, expressed so movingly on the page, aren't conveyed with as much potency through his performance. It's a game, auspicious effort, though.

Pi's feline tormentor, on the other hand, is a monumental creation, vividly brought to life with a mix of animatronics, CGI and reality. Like Caesar in Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes, Richard Parker is another bold leap forward for emotionally resonant digital characters: magnificent, frightening, heartbreaking, and an unceasingly compelling manifestation of wonder within the narrative tapestry.

Martel's spiritually minded prose, which comes steeped in meditation and metaphor, tips its hat to God-belief while also striking a humanistic chord, maintaining an edge of ambi","muslim,tiger,lifeboat,oscar,christian,fate,cargo ship,india,religion,zoo,psychology,wonder,hope,adrift,castaway,starvation,imagine,adrift,muslim,piscine,religion,scared,maths,lifeboat,orangutan,starving,toronto ontario canada,hyena,oscar nominee,pi,hope,can,tiger,swimming pool,teenage boy,drift,faith,mathematics,teenage boy,wow,shipwreck,swim,india,hindu,water,shipwreck,weight loss,faith,trust,zoo,fantastic,pie,oscar 2013,make it up,eye of the tiger,made up,injured animal,zookeeper,zebra,zookeeper,starving,god,fabricate,whale,fear",7286.jpg,11/21/2012,,mZEZ35Fhvuc,,,"Drama,Action & Adventure"

So how did a group of female support soldiers end up fighting alongside Marines in some of the most violent counterinsurgency battles of the Iraq War? Powerful and provocative, Lioness traces the stories of five female support soldiers who served in Iraq in various capacities - mechanic, supply clerk, engineer - and ultimately became the first women in American history to be sent into direct ground combat. The film follows the Lionesses' rapid progression from diffusing tensions with local civilians to fierce street-level combat in Ramadi, and in doing so raises such issues as gender and warfare and the deep divide between policy and practice. Together, the experiences of these women illuminate the emotional and psychological effects of war from a uniquely female perspective. Narrating the Lioness stories through a wide array of mediums including first-hand accounts, archival footage, journal entries, and interviews with military commanders, Lioness gives voice to a hidden history of female combat and, more broadly, explores how human beings are forever transformed by the trauma of war.","Lioness presents the untold story of the first group of women soldiers in US history to be sent into direct ground combat, in violation of official policy.

When the mob wants to get rid of someone, they will send their target 30 years into the past where a looper, a hired gun, like Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is waiting to mop up. Joe is getting rich and life is good until the day the mob decides to close the loop, sending back Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) for assassination. The film is written and directed by Rian Johnson and also stars Emily Blunt, Paul Dano, and Jeff Daniels.","Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis go to the future and back again....Joseph Gordon-Levitt's killer has to track down and kill his future self (Bruce Willis). As if that wasn't trippy enough, Rian Johnson's Action & Adventure thriller further befuddled us by changing direction entirely in its second half.

""This year's The Matrix,"" we bellowed - and certainly, it's been a while since Hollywood has produced a sci-fi movie so exuberant in its blend of entertainment and head-fuckery. 

Miller's Crossing. The Royal Tenenbaums. Magnolia. Three Kings. All films by modern American directors who already showed considerable early promise with their first two movies, only to hit the ball right out the park with number three.

Rian Johnson does just that with Looper, an extraordinary time-travel tale that's as intricately and elegantly constructed as the pocket watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt's hitman Joe keeps close by. Much like Johnson's 2005 debut, the Gordon-Levitt-starring high-school noir Brick, Looper comes complete with its own lexicon, starting with the title.

When the Mafia think it's time to retire their assassin, they send his future self back to be shot by his 2044 self.

Crack to the future

The situation only gets stickier when future Joe (Bruce Willis) arrives in the past with his own agenda - a Shanghai surprise that will throw everyone for a loop. We could tell you more, but then we'd have to kill you.

It has something to do with The Rainmaker, a mysterious Keyser Soze-like figure who has been closing all the loops in 2074, but we've already said too much_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_

Undeniably, Looper is conceptually big, bold and brave enough to stand alongside The Terminator, Back To The Future and Willis' own 12 Monkeys. _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•This time-travel crap fries your brain like an egg,_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´ says Jeff Daniels' Mafia mentor Abe.

Yet Johnson pulls together a plot that plays fair with the genre's internal logic. It's a world where carving a message in your arm will leave a scar for your future self to read, or where further physical trauma can literally leave you cracking up.

Crucially, for all its tick-tock plotting, there's an emotional story at Looper's core, bringing gravitas to its grand design. Themes of nature vs. nurture, family, redemption and undying love circle around these morally ambiguous characters - issues that come sharply into focus with the arrival of Sara (Emily Blunt), a shotgun-wielding single mother who allows Joe to take refuge on her farm.

Leaving behind the self-conscious dialogue of 2005's Brick and the overcooked quirk of his 2008 follow-up The Brothers Bloom, Johnson beautifully constructs a world in which hope and possibility are on offer (even if it's in the past).

Prosthetically pleasing

One of the movie's real high points is its vision of tomorrow's world. Looper's future is not so different that it seems alien to us; its rendering is as subtle as the prosthetics that pad out Levitt's face: far-away backdrops, skyline shots, a floating vehicle here and there_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_

Yes, you can see the Blade Runner influence in Ed Verreaux's production design, but never to the point of slavish homage. Just the occasional jarring oddity - some characters can float coins with a mysterious telekinetic power - puts Johnson's un","urban decay,ethics,death,critically acclaimed,tragedy,drug addiction,mother son relationship,drama,dystopia,drug withdrawal

2566,Lumumba,"Made in the tradition of true-life political thrillers such as Malcolm X and JFK, Raoul Peck's award-winning LUMUMBA is a gripping epic that dramatizes for the first time the rise and fall of legendary African leader Patrice Lumumba. When the Congo declared its independence from Belgium in 1960, the 36-year-old, self-educated Lumumba became the first Prime Minister of the newly independent state. Called ""the politico of the bush"" by journalists, he became a lightning rod of Cold War politics as his vision of a united Africa gained him powerful enemies in Belgium and the U.S. Lumumba would last just months in office before being brutally assassinated. Strikingly photographed in Zimbabwe, Mozambique and Belgium as civil war once again raged in the Congo, the film vividly re-creates the shocking events behind the birth of the country that became Zaire during the reign of Lumumba's former friend and eventual nemesis, Joseph Mobutu.","The true story of the rise to power and brutal assassination of the formerly vilified and later redeemed leader of the independent Congo, Patrice Lumumba. Using newly discovered historical evidence, Haitian-born and later Congo-raised writer and director Raoul Peck renders an emotional and tautly woven account of the mail clerk and beer salesman with a flair for oratory and an uncompromising belief in the capacity of his homeland to build a prosperous nation independent of its former Belgium overlords. Lumumba emerges here as the heroic sacrificial lamb dubiously portrayed by the international media and led to slaughter by commercial and political interests in Belgium, the United States, the international community, and Lumumba's own administration; a true story of political intrigue and murder where political entities, captains of commerce, and the military dovetail in their quest for economic and political hegemony.

7340,Lymelife,"Based on the true childhood experiences of director Derick Martini, Lymelife is the coming of age story of 15-year old Scott growing up in suburban Long Island. While caught up in his first love, Scott watches the relationships of his parents and their neighbors slowly crumble as they try to keep up with the changing times and expectations of the 1970s. Critically acclaimed, Lymelife features a magnificent ensemble cast, with incredible performances that make you laugh and cry along with them.","A family unit begins to bow under the pressure of a failing marriage. Set in the late 70's, seen through the innocent eyes of a fifteen year old boy, SCOTT, ""Lymelife"" is a unique take on the dangers of the American Dream. This funny, sad, violent and sometimes tragic look at first love, family dynamics and divorce weaves an intricate tapestry of American life during a time of drastic economic and emotional change.

As the saying goes, happy families are all the same for your off-the-peg white-collar suburban drama, only the dysfunctional ones can generate the requisite narrative friction. 

So it is with Derick Martini's semi-autobiographical debut, a late-'70s cul-de-sac of ennui in which two New Jersey families inflict their flaws and infidelities on each other. It justifies itself with a grounded, tack-sharp script that turns on a dime from warm-hearted domestic humour to black-edged threats of conflict and violence. 

In the eye of the hurricane is Rory Culkin's cherubic teening‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇScott, buffeted between warring parents (Jill Hennessy and Alec Baldwin, whose alpha-gorilla screen presence gets full rein), school bullies, heart-of-gold-bitch love-interest Adrianna (Emma Roberts) and angry army brother Jimmy (Kieran Culkin). 

While dad screws Adrianna's slutty mum Melissa (Cynthia Nixon), her Lyme disease-crippled husband Charlie (Timothy Hutton, near stealing the film) descends into a stoned-out funk, hiding in the basement to sketch pictures of the duo... It's a seething petri-dish of soured dreams and relationships tempered with barbed wit and human warmth. Despite laboured metaphors and an evasive, dull-edged conclusion that doesn't live up to its promise, Lymelife gets there via some stonkingly performed vignettes including an electrifyingly tense verbal duel between Hutton and Baldwin. 

It's been done before, but to criticise it for that would be beside the point. It's not what you tell, after all, but how you tell it. Dysfunctional adults and disaffected kids tear chunks out of each other in a hazy '70s purgatory of drab copper hues and horrible brown clothes. Brave, intelligent and bitingly witty.

Boasting cheap labour, exotic scenery and non-existent health and safety regulations, the Philippines was a dreamland for exploitation filmmakers whose renegade productions were soon engulfing drive-in screens around the globe like a tidal schlock-wave! At last, the all-too-often overlooked world of drive-in filler from Manilla gets the Mark Hartley (NOT QUITE HOLLYWOOD) treatment in Machete Maidens Unleashed!

Many of them found it in the Philippines, a country full of exotic locations, cooperative officials and folks willing to work cheap. Local producer Eddie Romero began exporting his cut-rate horror and crime pictures to American distributors in the 60s, and before long U.S. filmmakers were traveling there to shoot crazed jungle epics, women in prison thrillers, bloody horror stories and violent wartime dramas. It certainly helped that Philippine extras and technicians would work hard for low pay, and that local stuntmen didn't seem to worry much about risking their necks for a good shot; as one producer put it, ""Human life was cheap, film was cheap -- it was a great place to shoot a movie!""

After days of wondering in the inhospitable landscape and becoming more disorientated, a Native American crosses their path. The group must decide if they can trust this man to lead them to water or a more sinister fate.","John Ford's Westerns printed the legend. Kelly Reichardt's tale of pioneers lost in the desert paints those wagons as they really were - long, slow and uncomfortable.

Reichardt's deliberately obscure anti-Western divided opinion, not least for using the old 1:33 aspect ratio. Expect confused Blu-ray owners to ask for their money back.Over the last few years Kelly Reichardt, along with her regular screenwriter Jon Raymond, has quietly been building an impressive body of work. 

This, her fourth feature (third with Raymond), reunites her with Michelle Williams, the star of Wendy And Lucy, and returns to the setting of Old Joy, the Cascade   Mountains of Oregon. 

But this time Reichardt's delved into the past and come up with a western _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü one that, while it nods to the classics of the genre, coolly overturns most of their basic conventions. 

As the opening embroidery-stitched credits tell us, we're on the Oregon Trail in 1845. 

Three young-ish couples, plus a 10-year-old son, are being led through the wilderness by Stephen Meek (Bruce Greenwood, with a luxuriant foliage of shaggy beard), a mountain man who claims to know a cutoff (ie shortcut) through the mountains. But it's evident that for all his bluster (_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•We're not lost.

Then they capture a lone Cayuse Indian. Meek wants to kill him, but Solomon Tetherow (Will Patton) and his wife Emily (Williams) believe he can lead them to water. And gradually Emily finds other reasons why he should be allowed to live. 

Shooting mainly in mid- and long-shot, Reichardt locates her pioneers in the vast indifference of the landscape, emphasising their isolation and vulnerability. 

Repeatedly, we see the men conferring together at a distance, their words only intermittently audible; the women, who are cooking, cleaning, nurturing and keeping the show on the road, are excluded from all decisions. But when it comes to a climactic showdown, it's Emily who takes a stand. 

The style is austere, minimalist even _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü for long passages there's no dialogue, Jeff Grace's score falls silent, and we're left with the sigh of the wind and the squeak of a wagon wheel. 

But the slow build-up of tension is inexorable. And in the end, there are no easy answers.

With its mythic, dreamlike atmosphere, hints of feminism and a subversive touch of political allegory, Meek's Cutoff is a bold new take on the Old West.

2801,Miss Representation,"Like drawing back a curtain to let bright light stream in, Miss Representation (TV-14 DL) uncovers a glaring reality we live with every day but fail to see. Written and directed by Jennifer Siebel Newsom, the film exposes how mainstream media contribute to the under-representation of women in positions of power and influence in America. The film challenges the media's limited and often disparaging portrayals of women and girls, which make it difficult for women to achieve leadership positions and for the average woman to feel powerful herself.

		In a society where media is the most persuasive force shaping cultural norms, the collective message that our young women and men overwhelmingly receive is that a woman's value and power lie in her youth, beauty, and sexuality, and not in her capacity as a leader. While women have made great strides in leadership over the past few decades, the United States is still 90th in the world for women in national legislatures, women hold only 3% of clout positions in mainstream media, and 65% of women and girls have disordered eating behaviors.

		Stories from teenage girls and provocative interviews with politicians, journalists, entertainers, activists and academics, like Condoleezza Rice, Nancy Pelosi, Katie Couric, Rachel Maddow, Margaret Cho, Rosario Dawson and Gloria Steinem build momentum as Miss Representation accumulates startling facts and statistics that will leave the audience shaken and armed with a new perspective.","Explores the under-representation of women in positions of power and influence in America, and challenges the media's limited portrayal of what it means to be a powerful woman.","sexism,female politician,television,womens issues,sincere,gender issues,prejudice,thought provoking,gender bias,women,media",2801.jpg,1/1/2011, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/miss-representation/id500466035?uo=4,S5pM1fW6hNs,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"

7316,Neds,"In 1970's Glasgow, John is a bright boy. With no one willing to give him a chance, he descends into a life of crime. Actor/director Peter Mullan's intense portrayal of NEDS is a gritty look at the loss of hope. 2011 Tribeca Film Festival Official Selection.","Peter Mullan goes back to his roots in his violent drama about delinquents in 1970s Glasgow. Released the same month as The King's Speech, but worlds apart.

That's three-for-three for Mullan as director, and still he's the best kept secret in British cinema despite Tyrannosaur highlighting those acting chops.Nine years after he picked up a Golden Lion at Venice for The Magdalene Sisters, it's fair to say Peter Mullan probably has Shane Meadows to thank for NEDS making it to the big screen. 

However, while its working-class street gangs in retro fashions echo This Is England, Mullan's film is a much more forbidding beast, ditching Meadows' inviting nostalgia (pre-Stephen Graham's arrival, anyway) for a palpable fury against the cruel roots of street thuggery. 

We're in a superbly recreated '70s Glasgow, where bright working-class boy John McGill (angel-faced Greg Forrest) has managed to pick up top prize as he finishes primary school.

Itching to excel at his new school, he's dismayed to discover it's not intent on leaving no child behind. At home John has to contend with his downtrodden mother, tearaway brother and drunken, abusive father (Mullan himself, in a blistering cameo that's at once terrifying and pathetic). 

Stifling stuff for a clever lad, then, and since this is British social realism and not Dangerous Minds, Mullan goes on to forensically detail how frustration at his lot drives John (played as middle teen, superbly, by Conor Mccarron) to descend into rage and violence into becoming one of the title's non-educated delinquents. 

So far, so Fish Tank, or Ratcatcher, or The Complete Works Of Ken Loach. But Mullan's secret weapon is his largely nonprofessional cast drawn from the Glasgow estates he shot on watchable and unforced to a man (although Mullan takes no prisoners when it comes to accents), their charm gives heart to what could have been a clunky polemic. 

While a late stray into Freudian territory is a misstep, and John's relationships with his brother and father aren't as deeply explored as they could be, there's no denying the grim power of Mullan's painful study of just how much goes to waste when a whole class has no hope. 

Above all, though, there's an abiding poignancy, and a sadness that things just don't have to be this way.

Upsetting, shocking and riveting and coming on oddly like season four of The Wire relocated to '70s Glasgow NEDS cements Mullan's position in the front rank of British filmmakers.

The emotional fireworks soon fizzle out, thanks to a wet hero. Rapturously shot but Tran's stylistic fussiness is stifling, leaving only a languid portrait of emo-erotica.

Toru recalls his life in the 1960s, when his friend Kizuki killed himself and he grew close to Naoko, Kizuki's girlfriend, and another woman, the outgoing, lively Midori.

1314,Pocahontas,"History gets the Disney kiddie treatment and a politically correct interpretation in the studio's 33rd feature-length animated movie, the first to be based on actual events and people. Pocahontas (Irene Bedard) is the daughter of Algonquin chief Powhatan (Russell Means), who promises her in marriage to Kocoum, a brave whom she doesn't love. Pocahontas would rather be paddling in her canoe or wandering in the forest, communing with nature and her animal pals, Meeko, a raccoon, and the hummingbird Flit. When European settlers arrive, she becomes enamored of handsome John Smith (Mel Gibson). Their attraction is encouraged by Grandmother Willow (Linda Hunt), a talking tree. The situation between their peoples is tense, however, as the settlers, led by Governor Ratcliffe (David Ogden Stiers) desperately want the gold that they're sure the natives are concealing. When a dutiful sentry, Thomas (Christian Bale) follows Smith into the woods on one of his secret meetings with Pocahontas, a tragic mistake leads both groups to the brink of war. Only the love of Pocahontas and Smith can prevent bloodshed. Pocahontas (1995) was awarded two Oscars, for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score and Best Original Song for ""Colors of the Wind.""","Capt. John Smith leads a rag-tag band of English sailors & soldiers to the New World to plunder its riches for England (or, more precisely, for Governor Ratcliffe, who comes along for the ride).

Between Ratcliffe, who believes the ""savages"" are hiding the gold he expected to be plentiful, and Powhatan, who believes these pale newcomers will destroy their land, Smith and Pocahontas have a difficult time preventing all-out war, and saving their love for each other.","love,mining,17th century,touching,settler,ship,colonial america,prospecting,feel good,captivating,native american",1314.jpg,6/15/1995, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/pocahontas/id189134616?uo=4,9q1QF8G47oU,862771,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Pocahontas/862771,"Animation,Kids & Family"

She's pregnant for the second time by her absent father, at home, she must wait hand and foot on her mother (Mo'Nique) a poisonously angry woman who abuses her emotionally and physically.

It's Harlem 1987. Sixteen year old Claireece Jones - who goes by her middle name Precious - is an illiterate, overweight black girl. She is pregnant with her second child, both children fathered by her biological father, who has continually raped her since she was a child, but who she doesn't see otherwise. Her infant daughter, Mongo - such named since she has Down Syndrome - lives with Precious' grandmother. Precious lives with her mother Mary, who abuses Precious both physically and emotionally. Mary does nothing but smoke, watch television and collect welfare through fraud (as she doesn't ever look for a job) and believes that education does nothing for Precious, who she would rather also collect welfare if only to bring money into the household.

This 'under the radar' event traverses over 2700 miles along the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains. The film weaves the story of three characters' experiences with immense mountain beauty and small-town culture as they attempt to pedal from Banff, Canada to a small, dusty crossing on the Mexican border. Mike, a 40-year old family man who uses this challenge to chart a new course in life; Matthew, a leader in extreme endurance racing who's competing for his 5th time; and Mary, the 1st female rider to race this route, will set out to accomplish what very few have been able to. Over the course of a few weeks they'll attempt to climb over 200,000 vertical feet over the Rocky Mountains. That's the equivalent of ascending Mount Everest from sea level seven times. They'll experience mental breakdowns, treacherous snow, hellacious blisters, and total fatigue. Above all, they'll race with no support and at times in total isolation. The tests of endurance and introspection throughout this powerful film prompts us to reflect on our inner desires to live life to the fullest.","As one of the many physical and endurance challenges humans choose to take on, this 2,700-mile mountain bike race from Banff, Canada, to the Mexico border provides the story for Ride the Divide. Three bicyclists (executive producer Mike Dion, Matthew Lee, and Mary Metcalf-Collier) travel along the Continental Divide in the Rocky Mountains and face blisters, boulders, and bears in this test of ability and agility. Named the Best Adventure Film at the 2010 Vail Film Festival, Ride the Divide was directed by Hunter Weeks. ~ Rachel Sprovtsoff, Rovi","human spirit,mountain biking,biker,rocky mountains,mountain bike,mexican border,great divide,race",2723.jpg,1/1/2010, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/ride-the-divide/id381143594?uo=4,jhrtPyr1KQI,70153206,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Ride_the_Divide/70153206,"Action & Adventure,Documentary,Sports & Fitness"

7309,Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes,"RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES is a revolution; an action-packed epic featuring stunning visual effects and creatures unlike anything ever seen before. At the story's heart is Caesar (Andy Serkis), a chimpanzee who gains human-like intelligence and emotions from an experimental drug. Raised like a child by the drug's creator (James Franco), Caesar ultimately finds himself taken from the humans he loves and imprisoned. Seeking justice, Caesar assembles a simian army and escapes -- putting man and primate on a collision course that could change the planet forever.","Brit Rupert Wyatt turns the prequel nobody wanted to see into a stunning blend of old-school storytelling and state-of-the-art mo-cap effects courtesy of ape expert Andy Serkis.

The surprise hit of the summer and one that, alongside Tintin, has reignited calls for Serkis' pioneering performance capture to be recognised by the Academy.A decade has passed since Tim Burton's Planet Of The Apes reimagining _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü time enough not just to upgrade its old-school prosthetics with photorealistic CG hominids, but also to learn from its mistakes. 

In thrall to his 1968 inspiration, Burton produced an inferior copy that, rather like Mark Wahlberg's character Leo, didn't seem to have a single idea in its head. 

Rupert Wyatt's reboot-slash-prequel rights that immediately by being about something: animal testing, nature versus nurture, the perils of DNA tinkering. This time around, it's not just the apes that have above-average intelligence.

In a lush, far-off jungle, a female chimpanzee is seized by poachers and relocated to a hi-tech lab in San Francisco, a journey telescoped via a single zoom in and out of her panic-stricken pupil. 

It's a technique _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü used again later to elide her son Caesar's transition from baby orphan to inquisitive, hyperactive infant _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü that instantly forges an empathy between ape and audience. 

And it's one that is only bolstered by the trials Caesar undergoes as he progresses from being scientist James Franco's pet-cum-experiment _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü the key to a serum that could reverse his dad's Alzheimer's _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®¬¨√Ü to eventually instigating a full-blown monkey rebellion.

Those ordeals include his forcible detention in a squalid animal shelter and bad treatment at the hands of both Tom Felton's sadistic custodian and his fellow primate inmates. 

Is it any wonder we're rooting for him to cast off his shackles? It's classic hero stuff: the boy who would be king, evolving before our eyes into a leader, fighter and military strategist. 

Indeed, if Andy Serkis' soulful, performance-captured portrayal achieves anything, it is to make Caesar a chimp of thought as well as Action & Adventure.

Yes, /Rise/ has its flaws. As Franco's profit-obsessed boss David Oyelowo might as well come on twirling a moustache (_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•I run a business, not a petting zoo!_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´), while Freida Pinto is a sententious, preachy pain as his primatologist girlfriend (_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•Some things are not meant to be changed!_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´). 

Yet any cavils are long forgotten by the time the movie reaches its jaw-dropping crescendo, a spectacular bout of gorilla warfare on the Golden Gate Bridge that leaves several of the summer's blockbusters for dust. 

In putting the apes firmly at the heart of their own franchise, while still referencing backwards with a few well-placed, Heston-related in-jokes, Wyatt has given a moribund property a whole new lease of life.

With simulated simians authentic enough to make Project Nim look almost phoney, allied to an involving, evolving story, Rise is the Planet we've been waiting for.

7293,Shame,"Driven by a brilliant and ferocious performance by Michael Fassbender, Shame tells the riveting story of Brandon; a handsome New York businessman with a dark and destructive secret. His solitary existence is shaken by the unexpected arrival of his sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan, An Education), another damaged soul who brings memories of a painful shared past. Graphic, highly provocative and undeniably powerful, Shame is a devastating and thought-provoking cinematic experience.","A grubby, drowning nightmare of self-hate and angry rutting.

There's plenty of bang for your buck in Steve McQueen's second feature. Yet Shame's long, hard look at sex addiction proves anything but sexy. Think harsh, haunting and powerful instead. As in his blazing debut Hunger, McQueen plays Scorsese to Michael Fassbender's De Niro, the star owning the film as tortured shag-slave Brandon.

He's a grot-loving thirtysomething fucking the pain away in the lonely affluence of hip, chilly New York until the arrival of his messed-up sister Sissy (Carey Mulligan) drives his compulsions/perversions to levels he can't conceal or quench. Brandon's existence is a grubby, drowning nightmare of self-hate and angry rutting; Fassbender, who took Best Actor in Venice and could be on for an Oscar, is truly fearless.

Though exposed both emotionally and physically, he's always understated, even as Brandon's frustration escalates via depressing dates to back-street bonks, bar-room fingering and a final descent into hell splattered with vice and violence. McQueen and co-writer Abi Morgan's (The Iron Lady) script offers both a slowbuild character study and a deft comment on dislocated city living.

The direction is bracingly assured, McQueen unfurling lengthy, unbroken takes, following Brandon on a cathartic run through grey, anonymous streets in one scene while in another fixating obsessively on Mulligan's face during Sissy's painfully drawn-out nightclub rendition of New York, New York'. Not for the faint-hearted, prudish or impatient, Shame is as complex and ambiguous as its characters.

It's a masterwork of show don't tell' filmmaking that never fobs off viewers with absolutes, easy answers or a spelt-out root cause for Sissy and Brandon's problems. Instead McQueen subtly insinuates possible past trauma with the odd look or deceptively throwaway line. Pity, then, that the somewhat miscast Mulligan can't quite carry the weight of this world.

True, her character's underwritten, falling too close to self-pitying stereotypes of female flakiness. But in the hands of a fiercer, more intense actress Michelle Williams, say the brewing torment of the sibling dynamic could have been heartbreaking.

Still, Shame remains a provocative portrait of a man in thrall to uncontrollable desire. It's battering and ballsy, centred on a performance that brings pathos to porn-worship and gravitas to casual shagging in a city of people desperate to connect but unable to commit.

Fassbender is the full package in a carnal drama that spares no blushes and pulls no punches. Likely to be one of 2012's bravest and best.

Shrek decides to offer Lord Farquaad a deal; he will rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), who is intended to be Farquaad's bride.

They have been asked to investigate the disappearance of Rachel Solando (Emily Mortimer), a patient admitted to the asylum after she murdered her three children. As Teddy quizzes Dr. Cawley (Ben Kingsley), the head of the institution, he begins to suspect that the authorities in charge might not be giving him the whole truth, and that a terrible fate may befall all the patients in the spooky Ward C -- a unit devoted to the most heinous of the hospital's inmates.

7283,Sightseers,"Chris wants to show Tina his world and he wants to do it his way - on a journey through the British Isles in his beloved Abbey Oxford caravan. Tina has led a sheltered life and there are things that Chris needs her to see, but it doesn't take long for the dream to fade. Litterbugs, noisy teenagers and pre-booked caravan sites, not to mention Tina's meddling mother, soon conspire to shatter Chris's dreams and send him, and anyone who rubs him up the wrong way, over a very jagged edge.","After Down Terrace and Kill List, Ben Wheatley shows his lighter side with this comedy about caravanning couple Steve Oram and Alice Lowe. Well, we say ""light"" - tourism can be such a bloody affair. Whether Sightseers will see an increase in caravan holidays is a moot point.

From Badlands to Natural Born Killers, lovers-on-the-run flicks take pulp-fiction narratives for romantic rides across America, the sweep and the drama of the scenery matching the magnitude of the heroes' emotions - and their crimes.

The genius of Kill List director Ben Wheatley's third film, a parochial black comedy based on a screenplay by lead actors Steve Oram and Alice Lowe, is that it takes all this cultural baggage and transports it, by caravan, to Redditch.

As normal-seeming new boyfriend Chris (Oram) whisks homebody Tina (Lowe) away on a UK holiday, the trail of deaths they cause begins mundanely, with a car park-based RTA at the Crich Tramway Museum.

The settings more than match, as the pair explore Little England in all its pretty pettiness, from Castleton's Blue John Cavern to Keswick's Pencil Museum. Even their star-crossed love is constantly undercut by their deadpan patter, not to mention Tina's penchant for pot pourri and crotchless (but crocheted) knickers

When she envisages them dying together in the name of romance, Chris's response is characteristically practical/Partridge-esque. _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•Going to salsa's romantic,_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´ he says. _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•We could try that first._‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´

It might not sound much on paper, but it's all in the delivery, the appealing lead performances combining with Wheatley's sudden tonal shifts to produce a film that's funny, sinister and strangely moving.

Don't write in, but the Midlands accents help here: unpretentious and unexpected, they bring to mind Shane Meadows' early work (which this strongly recalls) and undercut the characters' more extreme pronouncements. _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•He's ruined the tram museum for me now,_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´ huffs Chris of his first victim, while Tina's attempt to talk dirty results in: _‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†¬¨¬•He said he wanted to shit in my hand and make me use it as a brown lipstick!_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√¢√†‚àö¬®‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´

Between killer lines and skull-cracking murders, there's a weary reality that makes Sightseers sad where lesser works might skew silly. As Tina's fear of being left behind by Chris lead them further along the road to ruin, their deteriorating relationship is echoed by the increasingly desolate surroundings.

One scene ends with a dog eating sick - you don't see that in True Romance. Another, in Keswick Pencil Museum, leaves you unsure whether to laugh or cry.

It may peter out a little towards the end, as all road movies must, but for the most part this is a staycation to cherish.

Verdict:

At first Father Ted cute, but then League Of Gentlemen cruel - a combination that Wheatley never lets curdle - this is a dark little delight.

He now finds himself living back with his mother (Jacki Weaver) and father (Robert DeNiro) after spending eight months in a state institution on a plea bargain. Pat is determined to rebuild his life, remain positive and reunite with his wife, despite the challenging circumstances of their separation. All Pat's parents want is for him to get back on his feet--and to share their family's obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles football team. When Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), a mysterious girl with problems of her own, things get complicated. Tiffany offers to help Pat reconnect with his wife, but only if he'll do something very important for her in return. As their deal plays out, an unexpected bond begins to form between them, and silver linings appear in both of their lives.","Patrizio Solitano Jr. (Bradley Cooper), who has bipolar disorder, is released from a mental health facility into the care of his parents after eight months of treatment. During his time there, he forms a close friendship with a fellow patient, Danny (Chris Tucker), who is having legal disputes with the hospital which constantly prevents him from leaving. Pat soon learns that his wife, Nikki, has moved away and his father, Pat Sr. (Robert De Niro), is out of work and resorting to bookmaking to earn money to start a restaurant. Pat is determined to get his life back on track and reconcile with Nikki, who obtained a restraining order against him after the violent episode that sent him away.
While talking to his court-mandated therapist Dr. Patel (Anupam Kher), Pat explains again why he was hospitalized. Coming home early from his high school teaching job, noticing clothes thrown on the floor and his wedding song Stevie Wonder's ""My Cherie Amour"" playing, he finds Nikki in the shower, with another man. Enraged, he nearly beat the man to death. Despite this, Pat doesn't believe he needs medication to manage his condition.
At dinner with his friend Ronnie, he meets Ronnie's sister-in-law, Tiffany Maxwell (Jennifer Lawrence), a recent widow who also just lost her job. Pat and Tiffany develop an odd friendship through their shared neuroses, and he sees an opportunity to communicate with Nikki through her. Tiffany offers to deliver a letter to Nikki, if in return he will be her partner in an upcoming dance competition. He reluctantly agrees and the two begin a rigorous practice regimen over the following weeks, with help from Danny, who is eventually released. Pat believes the competition will be a good way to show Nikki he has changed and become a better man. Tiffany gives Pat a typed reply from Nikki, in which she cautiously hints there may be a chance for a reconciliation between them.
Things go well for Pat until his father asks him to attend a Philadelphia Eagles game he has bet virtually all of his money on, as a ""good-luck charm"". Pat skips practice with Tiffany to attend the game, but is dragged into a fight with racist thugs attacking Dr. Patel, and is hauled away by police. The Eagles lose the game and Pat Sr. is furious. Tiffany arrives, berates Pat, and points that the way she ""reads the signs"", the Eagles do better when she and Pat are together, as they won every game they played on occasions when Pat and Tiffany spent time together. Pat Sr., now convinced that Pat being with Tiffany is actually good luck, makes a parlay with his gambling friend that if the Eagles win their game against Dallas, and if Pat and Tiffany score at least a 5 out of 10 in their dance competition, he will win back all the money he lost on the first bet. Pat is reluctant to participate in the dance contest under those conditions and re-reads Nikki's letter. He notices that the phrase Tiffany had said earlier, ""reading the signs,"" appears in the letter supposedly written by Nikki. He shows up for the next dance practice with Tiffany ready to perfect their routine.
Pat, Tiffany, and everyone else arrive at the competition on the night of the football game. Tiffany is horrified to discover that Nikki has actually come to the dance competition, Ronnie and Veronica in tow. When Ronnie and Veronica come upstairs to wish Tiffany luck, Tiffany becomes hysterical, and claims that her sister and brother-in-law are ""killing her"". They explain that this may be the chance for Pat and Nikki to get their marriage back on track, and Tiffany walks to the bar to get some vodka. Pat soon finds Tiffany, who has had two vodkas, and manages to coax her onto the dance floor, where they perform their routine. As they dance, the Eagles win their game and at the conclusion of their set, they score exactly 5 points‚Äö√Ñ√ÆPat and Tiffany are elated.
Amid cheers from his family and confused looks from the crowd, Pat leaves a victory hug from Tiffany to approach Nikki and speak quietly into her ear. Tiffany storms off, leaving the building entirely and walking into the night, sobbing. Pat leaves Nikki behind after only a short conversation, intent on finding Tiffany. Pat Sr. pulls Pat aside and tells him that he knows that he (Pat) hasn't listened to him, but to listen to him now. He explains that he doesn't know if Nikki ever loved him, but he knows that Tiffany does love him. He tells him to go after her, and Pat chases after her and tells her he knows she forged Nikki's letter. He gives her a letter of his own, where he conveys his thoughts. Tiffany doesn't deny it, although she gives him a knowing look. He confesses he has loved her from the moment he met her but has taken a long time to realize it and Tiffany asks him if he really loves her. After he tells her that he means it, she says, ""Okay"" and they kiss.
In the end, Pat and Tiffany become a couple and Pat Sr. opens a restaurant with the money he has won.","bin bag,jogging,robert de niro,cuckoo,oscar,bisexuality,love at first sight,fate,baseball,crazy,lose it all,betting,bradley cooper,friendship,bipolar disorder,divorce,mental illness,mental institution,medication,institutionalization,sex addiction,double or nothing,crying,oscar 2013,philadelphia eagles,ex wife,oscar nominee,just go with it,true love,bet,restraining order,jennifer lawrence,bin liner,soul mate,dance,psycho",7285.jpg,12/25/2012,,Lj5_FhLaaQQ,70244164,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Silver_Linings_Playbook/70244164,"Romance,Drama,Comedy"

Interweaving multiple storylines from the series' history, this violent crime noir paints the picture of the ultimate town without pity through the eyes of its roughest characters. There's the street thug Marv (Mickey Rourke), whose desperate quest to find the killer of a prostitute named Goldie (Jaime King) will lead him to the foulest edges of town. Inhabiting many of those areas is Dwight (Clive Owen), a photographer in league with the sordid ladies of Sin City, headed by Gail (Rosario Dawson), who opens up a mess of trouble after tangling with a corrupt cop by the name of Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro). Finally, there's Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an ex-cop with a heart problem who's hell-bent on protecting a stripper named Nancy (Jessica Alba). Featuring a who's who supporting cast that includes Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Devon Aoki, and Nick Stahl, Sin City promises to be one of the most direct translations from page to screen of a comic series, with shots and dialogue adapted straight from the original comic's panels. Rodriguez quit the Director's Guild when they refused to let Frank Miller co-direct the film, a deal hashed out after the two collaborators developed and shot the opening scene utilizing a green-screen process to harness the stark, black-and-white look of the books as a litmus test for the rest of the production. Quentin Tarantino was brought in and reportedly paid one dollar to direct an extended scene between Del Toro and Owen that amounts to one issue of The Big Fat Kill miniseries.

7261,Sound Of My Voice,"In SOUND OF MY VOICE, Peter (Christopher Denham) and Lorna (Nicole Vicius), a couple and documentary filmmaking team, infiltrate a mysterious group led by an enigmatic young woman named Maggie (Brit Marling). Intent on exposing her as a charlatan and freeing the followers from her grip, Peter and Lorna start to question their objective and each other as they unravel the secrets of Maggie's underworld.","The Movie: A duo of documentary filmmakers infiltrate the cult of alleged 'time traveller' Brit Marling. Is she or isn't she? Zal Batmanglij's indie thriller keeps us guessing. Aptly, a genuine cult is forming around star/co-writer Marling (Another Earth), an actress with a knack of fashioning smart indie pictures out of genre-friendly concepts. 

The companion piece to actress-screenwriter Brit Marling's Another Earth, Sound Of My Voice picks up in a similar mystical, sci-fi vein to its predecessor, unfolding on an equally sparse canvas.

Both projects debuted at Sundance 2011 and although Another Earth, about a student attempting to atone for a tragedy in the shadow of a doppelg‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ¬¢_nger planet, came out first and hogged plaudits, Sound Of My Voice is equally as intriguing and thought-provoking, the more eerie and commercially thrilling of the two films, if not as visually confident.

Documentary-making couple Lorna (Nicole Vicius) and Peter (Christopher Denham) are blindfolded and taken to a cult fronted by Marling's Maggie, a frail, ethereal young woman claiming to be from the year 2054.

Dressed in a white, Jesus-like shroud and dragging an oxygen tank around a drab suburban basement, Maggie soothes her misfit followers with tales of the postapocalyptic world to come, in which food is scarce but hippy-dippy values of free love and living off the land have taken over.

Maggie does plenty to fuel the dubious couple's determination to covertly film and expose her, not least singing a song that's supposedly from the future that will sound familiar to anyone owning a Cranberries CD.

But the charismatic cult leader also starts messing with their minds_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_ and making increasingly bizarre demands.

Director/co-writer Zal Batmanglij might be a blander hand behind the camera than Mike Cahill (who performed identical duties on Another Earth), but he does instil a trance-like atmosphere of unease using simple techniques and strategies, including splitting the film into numbered chapters.

But the bottom line is that it's Marling's hypnotic performance that keeps the story cogs spinning, with Maggie drifting between an air of serene fragility and something far more ominous.

And like Another Earth, SOMV's final scene delivers a nifty, rug-pulling jolt.

Verdict:

Like Martha Marcy May Marlene, this lo-fi psychodrama reaps the benefits of a mesmerising female lead, only this time as cult leader not disciple. Marling continues to impress.

Oliver Stone sets out on a road trip across five countries to explore the social and political movements as well as the mainstream media's misperception of South America while interviewing seven of its elected presidents. In casual conversations with Presidents Hugo Chavez (Venezuela), Evo Morales (Bolivia), Lula da Silva (Brazil), Cristina Kirchner  (Argentina), as well as her husband and ex-President Nestor Kirchner, Fernando Lugo (Paraguay), Rafael Correa (Ecuador), and Raul Castro (Cuba), Stone gains unprecedented access and sheds new light upon the exciting transformations in the region.","Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez is a hero in Latin America for his willingness to stand up to the United States (both the government and the private sector) and his desire to use the nation's petroleum resources as a tool to bring a better way of life to the working class under his rule. But Chavez's policies have made him many enemies in North America, and in the American news media (especially conservative outlets such as Fox News), Chavez has been demonized for his rejection of U.S. policy, his pro-socialist stance, and his openly combative stance toward George W. Bush. Are either of these extremes an accurate portrait of the real Hugo Chavez? Filmmaker Oliver Stone presents a portrait of Chavez the politician and Chavez the man in his documentary South of the Border, which is built around a series of in-depth interviews Stone conducted with the Venezuelan president. Stone also includes interviews with a number of other major Latin American leaders, among them Bolivia's Evo Morales, Argentina's Cristina Kirchner, Brazil's Lula da Silva, and Cuba's Raul Castro.

However, the back-stabbing leader of their organization disbands them to prevent their involvement in the then forming NASA and labels them as non-team players. Flash forward to the present, the foursome are now living a docile life. The electrical engineer has a pleasant retired life in a desert home with his wife. The pilot, who had a penchant for pushing the test planes to their limits, is now a daredevil crop-duster. The navigator is a Baptist minister. The designer is a womanizing roller coaster designer. Their former boss is now a mission leader in Nasa and still as despicable as in his younger days. It is here that the main story begins.

Of course, because of the old technology, only the original team can save the day. As Cromwell's character makes many learning statements about the satellite to the Russian general who is working with the Americans to save the day, you know there is something much more nefarious about the satellite. After some struggles to get the four to pass their physicals in less than 30 days, the four with two young counterparts are launched on the space shuttle to fix the satellite. Dean's character has somehow been coerced to be in on the subterfuge involving Cromwell and in an unexplained action, he tries to make connections on the satellite that causes the whole mission to become a disaster and creates the greatest action sequences in the film...

7313,Submarine,"15-year-old Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts of JANE EYRE) has two objectives: To lose his virginity before his next birthday, and to smother the flame between his mother (Sally Hawkins of NEVER LET ME GO, MADE IN DAGENHAM) and an ex-lover (Paddy Considine of THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM, IN AMERICA) who has reappeared in her life. Worried that his mom is having an affair, Oliver monitors his parents' sex life by charting the dimmer switch in their bedroom. Meanwhile, he attempts to woo his classmate, Jordana, a self-professed pyromaniac who supervises his journal writing - especially the bits about her. Based on Joe Dunthorne's acclaimed novel, Submarine is a captivating coming-of-age story with an offbeat edge.","Richard Ayoade's debut came on like a blend of Wes Anderson's whimsy, Francois Truffaut's freewheeling heart and even a touch of The Graduate in Alex Turner's acoustic songs. Which makes it easily the coolest film to come out of Wales.

Alongside Attack The Block and Tyrannosaur, Ayoade's debut proved that just because you're already famous doesn't mean you can't direct well.  Plus, it briefly made dufflecoats cool again. Clearly, TF star columnist Richard Ayoade isn't just that ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ¬¢_ber-geek from The IT Crowd. 

He's co-written and directed cult comedies (Garth Marenghi's Darkplace) and made music videos for Arctic Monkeys and Vampire Weekend. 

But on the evidence of his feature debut, at least, Ayoade retains a keen empathy for the socially awkward. 

Adapted from Joe Dunthorne's novel, Submarine is the story of Oliver Tate (Craig Roberts), a teenager in a small Welsh town with two goals: to lose his virginity and to prevent his mother (Sally Hawkins) from having it away with the mulleted neighbour (a perfect Paddy Considine). But Oliver's attempts at adult interAction & Adventure are hampered by a level of self-absorption that's amusing and heart-piercing in equal measure. 

In his pursuit of uncomfortable laughs, Ayoade gets a big assist from his two duffle-coated leads, particularly Yasmin Paige as Oliver's cold, coquettish girlfriend, Jordana. 

But what beguiles is that Submarine is the vainglorious arthouse epic a 15-year-old movie buff would see himself starring in. nouvelle Vague-referencing jump cuts, pontificating voiceover, title cards grandly announcing each chapter_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_ 

Far from show-off flourishes, such devices serve Ayoade's arch, affectionate portrait of a teenager's mind-scape. Here, to be young is to be a self-obsessed nincompoop. 

If Submarine loses momentum as it progresses, that's because there are no cathartic resolutions. When Oliver tries to kick a bully in the balls, the bully catches his leg mid-air. 

When he grandly confesses his undying love to Jordana, she's witheringly unimpressed.
Smart and sly, funny and fourth-wall-breaking_‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√∫_ but above all, an excruciatingly accurate coming-of-ager. On this evidence, Ayoade could be Britain's answer to Wes Anderson.

Meanwhile, Nick's younger brother (Peter Plaugborg) has his own demons; he's a heroin addict who is running out of ways to finance his habit, and while he loves his young son Martin (Gustav Fischer Kjaerulff), managing his habit and looking after his child are more than he can manage at the same time.

7245,Sweetwater,,"In the late 1800s, a fanatical religious leader, a renegade Sheriff, and a former prostitute collide in a blood triangle on the rugged plains of the New Mexico Territory.

It's hard not to imagine Tarantino having some fun with Sweetwater, a movie that splices female vengeance with spaghetti-western pastiche and plays carnage for dark laughs.

Call it Jan(uary) Jo(nes) Unchained, as the Mad Men actress goes gunning for retribution in a dress so purple it ought to be on tour with Prince.

Such heightened details add to the movie-movieness of this second film from the Miller brothers (director Logan, writer Noah), although it's too slick to be schlock.

Just finished watching Sweetwater at the Sundance. Great audience reception! I think we were ready for a renewal of the western, an Action & Adventure packed morality play in an otherwise overly-intellectual festival. January Jones plays Sara, the prostitute turned good housewife. After his husband is killed by maniac prophet Josiah (Jason Isaacs, in role tailor made for his cold features) she goes on a cleaning spree a-la-Dirty Harry. And does she clean up shop! All the bad guys get what they had coming, and in the wild west the only penalty for misbehaving is lead. She does a very credible job as an avenging angel with a cute face and a purple umbrella. 

A highly entertaining film, with few good guys but a satisfying morality tale. Ed Harris is a treat as an anachronic elder flower child of the 1970's. I wished to see Sara and Sheriff Jackson ride into the sunset, and meet again in a later film.",,7245.jpg,1/24/2013,,jH4Bqllaf-o,70267272,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Sweetwater/70267272,Western

3705,The Andromeda Strain,"A group of scientists investigate a deadly new alien virus before it can spread.
This compelling account of the earth‚Äö√Ñ√¥s first biological crisis is perhaps the most chillingly realistic science fiction thriller ever made. After an errant satellite crashes to Earth near a remote New Mexico village, the recovery team discovers that almost everyone in the town are victims of a horrible death, with the mysterious exception of an infant and an old homeless man. The survivors are brought to a state-of-the-art laboratory descending five stories beneath the ground where the puzzled scientists race against time to determine the nature of the deadly microbe before it wreaks worldwide havoc. A trailblazer in the areas of special effects and inventive sets, The Andromeda Strain is based on Michael Crichton's best-selling novel that created national paranoia for its topical relevance to the first moon landing.

The ""Andromeda Strain"" is a deadly extraterrestrial virus. It is brought to Earth when a research satellite crashes near a tiny Arizona town. Everyone in the community dies within days, except for a baby and an ""insulated"" drunkard. Recruited from labs all over North America, doctors Charles Dutton (David Wayne), Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), Ruth Leavitt (Kate Reid), and Mark Hall (James Olson) don radiation suits and race against time to isolate and destroy the virus.

","After a US government satellite crashes near the town of Piedmont, New Mexico, all of the town's inhabitants are killed in hideous fashion. There are only two survivors ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ a sixty-two-year-old man and a six-month-old infant. Suspecting that the satellite brought back an alien germ, the military activates an elite scientific team it had previously assembled for just this type of emergency. The team takes the satellite and the survivors to a secret underground laboratory in the Nevada desert, known as the Wildfire Complex. The new life form is assigned the code name Andromeda. While most of the team studies the organism in an attempt to figure out how it works, the team's doctor tries to find a cure by figuring out why the old man and the baby survived. Just as he comes up with the answer, however, Andromeda mutates into a form that degrades synthetic rubber gaskets and thus escapes containment. This triggers an automatic self-destruct mechanism designed to set off a nuclear explosion beneath the complex, intended to incinerate all germs before they can reach the surface. However, the team members studying Andromeda have learned that the alien microbes, having evolved in the harsh environment of outer space, would thrive on the radiation of a nuclear explosion and would consequently be able to mutate into a supercolony of an untold number of forms. Having been entrusted with the only key that can shut down the self-destruct sequence before the five-minute countdown is up, the doctor races against the clock and the lab's automated defenses to reach a substation before it's too late.","exciting,scary,suspenseful",3705.jpg,1971-03-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-andromeda-strain/id316121015?uo=4,YMbSpnlOOtE,,,"Classics,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

3112,The Artist,"Hollywood 1927. George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a silent movie superstar. The advent of the talkies will sound the death knell for his career and see him fall into oblivion. For young extra Peppy Miller (Berenice Bejo), it seems the sky's the limit - major movie stardom awaits. The Artist tells the story of their interlinked destinies.","In 1927, silent film star George Valentin is posing for pictures outside the premiere of his latest hit film when a young woman, Peppy Miller, accidentally bumps into him. Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of Variety with the headline ""Who's That Girl?"" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a beauty spot on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.
Two years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens within a few days of Peppy's new sound film as well as the 1929 Stock Market Crash. Now Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.
Later, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and fires Clifton, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the nitrate film quickly blazes out of control he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one she was first in. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house, to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to sternly remind Valentin of his changing luck.
Peppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that it had been Peppy who had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide. The two reconcile, and remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a musical together.
Now the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, ""Cut!"" to which Zimmer adds: ""Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me one more?"" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies ""With pleasure!"" revealing his strong French accent.[17] The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.","tap dancing,film producer,applause,stylized,hollywood california,coincidence,cinema,near death experience,zip it,deaf,suicide attempt,falling star,silent scream,beauty spot,quiet,film industry,fired from the job,movie producer,true love,watching a movie,movie star,jack russell terrier,chance encounter,surprise,film making,photography,silent film star,wife leaves husband,movie studio,stock market crash,ssshhhhh,silent,second chance,year 1929,film reel,black and white,chauffeur,dancing,1930s,stock market crash 1929,show business,do,riches to rags,1920s,silent movie,sentimental,movie,hollywoodland,entertainment,anger,silent film,not prepared,movie set,emotional,pin drop,feel good,year 1931,clever,washed up star,filmmaking,butler,mustache",3112.jpg,2011-05-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-artist/id504114094?uo=4,OK7pfLlsUQM,,,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"

Before their divorce becomes final, Jerry and Lucy Warriner both do their best to ruin each other's plans for remarriage, Jerry to haughty socialite Molly Lamont, she to oil-rich bumpkin Daniel Leeson. Among their strategies: Jerry's court-decreed visitation rights with Mr. Smith, their pet fox terrier, and Lucy sends flamboyant Dixie Belle Lee to impersonate Jerry's brassy ""sister"" before his prospective bride's scandalized family.

","Leo McCarey directed this classic screwball comedy in which Cary Grant and Irene Dunne play Jerry and Lucy Warriner, a couple whose marriage is starting to fall apart. Jerry informs Lucy that he's taking a vacation alone in Florida; instead, he holes up with his buddies and plays poker for a week (while sitting under a sun lamp so he'll have an appropriate tan). Lucy concludes that Jerry was never in Florida just as Jerry discovers that Lucy was spending her time with Armand Duvalle (Alex D'Arcy), a handsome voice teacher. Both Jerry and Lucy believe the other was unfaithful, so they agree to a trial divorce, with a bitter battle fought over custody of Mr. Smith, the dog (Lucy gets the dog, but Jerry has visitation rights). Determined to make Jerry jealous, Lucy continues keeping company with Armand while also dating Daniel Leeson (Ralph Bellamy), a wealthy oil man from Oklahoma. Convinced that turnabout is fair play, Jerry starts going out with Dixie Belle Lee (Joyce Compton), a brassy nightclub singer, as well as socialite Barbara Vance (Molly Lamont). However, Lucy has belatedly decided that she wants Jerry back, and she hatches a plan to win him back by making a spectacle of herself at a party.

But Terry and his crew don't realize the boxes also contain a treasure trove of dirty secrets - secrets that will thrust them into a deadly web of corruption and illicit scandal.
Business is slow for Terry Leather, a London car dealer, married with children. He's an artful dodger, so Martine, a former model with a thing for him, brings him her scheme: a bank's alarm is off for a couple weeks, so let's tunnel into the vault. He assembles a team, not realizing her real goal is a safe-deposit box with compromising photos of a royal: she needs the photos to trade for avoiding a jail sentence - and MI-5, or is it MI-6, is pulling the strings two steps removed.

Though he'd never been involved in any major crimes, he wasn't exactly on the straight and narrow his whole life either. Martine Love (Burrows) is a beautiful model from Terry's old neighborhood who knows that her former neighbor is no angel. When Martine proposes a foolproof plan to rob a Baker Street bank, Terry recognizes the danger but realizes this may be the opportunity of a lifetime. As the operation gets underway, the resourceful band of thieves burrows its way into a safe-deposit vault at the Lloyds Bank in Marylebone, quickly hitting a literal treasure trove of cash and priceless gems. But while the crew did know that the safe-deposit boxes contained millions in riches, they didn't realize that they also contained secrets that implicated everyone from London's most notorious underworld gangsters to powerful government figures, and even the Royal Family. Though the crime would make headlines all across Britain for several days after the fact, a government gag order eventually brought all reporting on the case to an immediate halt.

Richard (Di Caprio) is an American backpacking through Asia with a handful of friends from Europe. While in Bangkok, he meets a mad Scotsman who calls himself Daffy Duck (Robert Carlyle). Shortly before Mr. Duck kills himself, he gives Richard a crude map to a place in Thailand that he claims is paradise on earth: beautiful, unspoiled, and uninhabited.

When Bunny's kidnappers call to arrange the ransom exchange, Walter tries to convince The Dude to keep the money and give the kidnappers a ""ringer"" suitcase filled with his dirty underwear. The kidnappers escape with the ringer, and The Dude and Walter are left with the million-dollar ransom. Later that night, The Dude's car is stolen, along with the briefcase filled with money. The Dude receives a message from the Big Lebowski's daughter, Maude, who admits to hiring the criminals who knocked him unconscious. The Dude visits her at her art studio, and she reveals that Bunny is a porn starlet working for Jackie Treehorn. She agrees with The Dude's suspicion that Bunny kidnapped herself and asks The Dude to recover the ransom, as it was illegally withdrawn by her father from a charity.
The Big Lebowski angrily confronts The Dude over his failure to hand over the money, and hands The Dude an envelope sent to him by the kidnappers which contains a severed toe, presumably Bunny's. The Dude later receives a phone message from the police that his car has been found. Mid-message, three German nihilists invade the Dude's apartment, identifying themselves as the kidnappers. They interrogate and threaten him for the ransom money. The Dude returns to Maude's studio, where she identifies the German nihilists as Bunny's friends. The Dude picks up his car from the police, but the briefcase with the ransom money is still missing. He and Walter track down the supposed thief, a teenager named Larry Sellers. Their confrontation with Larry is unsuccessful, and the Dude and Walter leave without getting any money or information.
Jackie Treehorn's thugs return to The Dude's apartment to bring him to Treehorn's beach house in Malibu. Treehorn inquires about the whereabouts of Bunny, and the money, offering him a cut of any funds recovered. Treehorn then drugs The Dude's drink and The Dude passes out. After a surreal dream blending the themes of bowling, the Persian Gulf War, Maude‚Äö√Ñ√¥s ‚Äö√Ñ√∫vaginal‚Äö√Ñ√π art, and the nihilists, The Dude wakes up in a police car and is then placed in front of the police chief of Malibu. The police chief verbally and physically assaults The Dude and warns him not to return to Malibu. After a cab ride home, the driver throws The Dude out for asking to change the radio, and a red sportscar zooms past. Bunny is driving, with all ten toes intact. The Dude then finds his apartment completely trashed and is greeted by Maude Lebowski, who seduces him. During post-coital conversation with Maude, The Dude learns that she hopes to conceive a child with him but wants him to have no hand in the child's upbringing. He also finds out that, despite appearances, her father has no money of his own. Maude's late mother was the rich one, and she left her money exclusively to the family charity. In a flash, The Dude unravels the whole scheme: when the Big Lebowski heard that Bunny was kidnapped, he used it as a pretense for an embezzlement scheme, in which he withdrew the ransom money from the family charity to keep for himself. He gave an empty briefcase to The Dude (who would be the fall guy on whom he pinned the theft), and was content to let the kidnappers kill Bunny.
Meanwhile, it is now clear that the kidnapping was itself a ruse. While Bunny took an unannounced trip, the nihilists (her friends) alleged a kidnapping in order to get money from her husband. The Dude and Walter arrive at the Big Lebowski residence, finding Bunny back at home from her trip. They confront the Big Lebowski with their version of the events. The affair apparently over, The Dude and his bowling teammates are suddenly confronted by the nihilists, who have set The Dude's car on fire. They once again demand the million dollars. After hearing what The Dude and Walter know, the nihilists demand all the money in their pockets. Walter responds by throwing a bowling ball into one of the nihilists' ribs, biting another's ear off, and knocking the final nihilist unconscious with their portable radio. However, in the aftermath, The Dude's timid bowling companion Donny has a heart attack and dies.
Walter and The Dude go to a cliff overlooking a beach to scatter Donny's ashes. After an informal eulogy which Walter turns into a tribute to the Vietnam War and accidentally covers The Dude with Donny's ashes, Walter suggests, ""Fuck it, Dude. Let's go bowling."" The movie ends back at the bowling alley where ""The Stranger"" (Elliott), a narrator seen sitting at the bar, speaks to the camera and hints to the audience that Maude may be pregnant with a ""little Lebowski"".","unemployment,nihilism,lane strike,surrealism,threat,ransom,vietnam veteran,pot,alley,pastiche,loser,hippie,bowling ball,severed toe,bowling team,drugs,millionaire,spare,white russian,korea veteran,tournament,left hand,laziness,no job,joy,pot smoking,witty,hallucination,lane,severed ear,counter culture,mistaken identity,reefer,offbeat,drug,double cross,dope,ear bitten off,humorous,bowling shoes,marijuana,slacker,castration,jobless,doppelganger,dude,pin,bum,lazy,clever,bowling",1825.jpg,1998-02-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-big-lebowski/id280338635?uo=4,cd-go0oBF4Y,,,Comedy
2320,The Big Red One,"Outstanding performances from Academy Award-winner Lee Marvin (""Cat Ballou"") and Mark Hamill (""Star Wars"") highlight this vivid account of a special infantry squad and its intrepid sergeant during WWII. Robert Carradine tells director Samuel Fuller's autobiographical tale, as we follow the men from D-Day to the liberation of the Nazi death camps. Samuel Fuller's valedictory war picture, The Big Red One follows the First Infantry Division from Africa to Europe during the years 1942 through 1945. Lee Marvin portrays the division sergeant; he's tough and experienced, to be sure, but he takes on his job with cool professionalism rather than Hollywood bravado. Based on Fuller's own experiences, the film is a loosely constructed series of anecdotes. Among them are an insane asylum under bombardment while the inmates applaud and a climactic vignette in which a very young concentration camp internee dies while a friendly soldier plays piggy-back with the boy","The film begins in black and white at the end of World War I. A Private (Marvin), using his trench knife, kills a German soldier who was approaching with his arms raised and muttering in German. In the background stands a wooden crucifix, the wood infested with termites.
When he returns to his company's headquarters, the private is told that the war ended ""about four hours ago."" The 1st Division patch is shown in color.
The film then transitions to a Sergeant (also Marvin) as he leads his squad of infantrymen through North Africa, Sicily, and then on to Omaha Beach at the start of the Battle of Normandy.
The squad crosses the same field where the sergeant killed the surrendering German decades before, where a memorial now stands. The following short conversation takes place:
Johnson: Would you look at how fast they put the names of all our guys who got killed?
The Sergeant: That's a World War One memorial.
Johnson: But the names are the same.
The Sergeant: They always are.
The squad then treks though Europe, ending up at the liberation of Falkenau concentration camp in Czechoslovakia.
At the end of the film, the sergeant is in a forest, at night, having just buried a young boy he had befriended after liberating a concentration camp. A German soldier approaches, attempting to surrender, and the sergeant stabs him. His squad then arrives and informs him that the war ended ""about four hours ago."" This time, as the squad walks away, Pvt. Griff (Mark Hamill) notices that the German is still alive; the sergeant and his men work frantically to save his life as they return to their encampment.","exciting,rough,bleak,suspenseful,captivating",2320.jpg,1980-07-18, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-big-red-one/id302173054?uo=4,,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama"
2202,The Big Uneasy,"The first documentary by New Orleans resident and longtime ""mockumentarian"" Harry Shearer (This Is Spinal Tap; A Mighty Wind), The Big Uneasy follows three remarkable people - the leaders of two scientific investigation teams, and one whistle-blower - as they reveal the true story of why the city flooded, why it could happen again, and why other U.S. cities are at risk. It's the ""news"" the mainstream news media missed; an inside look at a disaster that could have been prevented from the people who were there. Critics have called it ""A gripping, persuasive film. Essential Viewing"" (The Los Angeles Times), ""Poignant...indispensable"" (The New York Times) and ""A scathing indictment...an airtight case."" (Village Voice).","Almost five years ago, a disaster struck New Orleans. The media said it was a natural disaster primarily affecting poor black people. On both counts, the media was wrong. In his feature-length documentary The Big Uneasy, humorist and New Orleans resident Harry Shearer gets the inside story of a disaster that could have been prevented from the people who were there. As we approach the fifth anniversary of the flooding of New Orleans, Shearer speaks to the investigators who poked through the muck as the water receded and a whistle-blower from the Army Corps of Engineers, revealing that some of the same flawed methods responsible for the levee failure during Katrina are being used to rebuild the system expected to protect the new New Orleans from future peril. In short segments hosted by John Goodman, Shearer speaks candidly with local residents about life in New Orleans. Together, they explore the questions that Americans outside of the Gulf region have been pondering in the five years since Katrina: Why would people choose the live below sea level? Why is it important to rebuild New Orleans? The Big Uneasy is laced with computer imagery that takes you inside the structures that failed so catastrophically, and boasts never-before-seen video of the moments when New Orleans began to flood and the painstaking investigations that followed. The Big Uneasy marks the beginning of the end of five years of ignorance about what happened to one of our nation's most treasured cities - and serves as a stark reminder that the same agency that failed to protect New Orleans still exists in other cities across America.

227,The Birds,"Nothing equals The Birds for sheer terror when Alfred Hitchcock unleashes his foul friends in one of his most shocking and memorable masterpieces. As beautiful blonde Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren) rolls into Bodega Bay in pursuit of eligible bachelor Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), she is inexplicably attacked by a seagull. Suddenly thousands of birds are flocking into town, preying on schoolchildren and residents in a terrifying series of attacks. Soon Mitch and Melanie are fighting for their lives against a deadly force that can't be explained and can't be stopped in one of Hollywood's most horrific films of nature gone berserk.","The story begins as an innocuous romantic triangle involving wealthy, spoiled Melanie Daniels (Tippi Hedren), handsome Mitch Brenner (Rod Taylor), and schoolteacher Annie Hayworth (Suzanne Pleshette). The human story begins in a San Francisco pet shop and culminates at the home of Mitch's mother (Jessica Tandy) at Bodega Bay, where the characters' sense of security is slowly eroded by the curious behavior of the birds in the area. At first, it's no more than a sea gull swooping down and pecking at Melanie's head. Things take a truly ugly turn when hundreds of birds converge on a children's party. There is never an explanation as to why the birds have run amok, but once the onslaught begins, there's virtually no letup.

7130,The Bitter Buddha,"The Documentary takes an unconventional journey with a true ""comic's comic"". For a few decades, Eddie Pepitone has proven to be a startling force in the alt-comedy scene. Within ""The Bitter Buddha"" we follow Eddie as he deals with a middle-age career surge, while struggling with self-doubt, sobriety, and a challenging family history. ","THE BITTER BUDDHA is a documentary that tells the story of comedian Eddie Pepitone's failure to have become a successful comedian by age 52. Understandably, he's bitter; it's the nectar of his humor. The ""Buddha"" part is less obvious. If it was intended to mock his improved outlook after achieving sobriety, I'm not laughing. Maybe this is a clue why comedic success has eluded him. He is actually very funny, albeit inconsistently. He's addicted to tweeting, here's my favorite featured in the movie: ""Whenever someone yells 'can I get a woot woot?' I like to yell 'only if you promise to read a book in your lifetime."" There are many talented artists who fail to achieve material success, and it is a very sad and all too common circumstance. One tries to control luck, contain their bewilderment and confusion as less talented people speed right past them. If these factors seem discouraging,imagine the impact of having the story of your failure as the subject of a film that features comments from your more successful peers praising your talent as they contemplate why you haven't been able to achieve what they have. Gee, if only they could put in a good word for you. Dana Gould, a (rather) successful comedian comments: ""I wouldn't say he walks the talk so much as he trudges the trudge."" With friends like these. I couldn't discern the intention of this movie. If it's meant to be a launching pad for his comedy career, it's disingenuous. It feels like a showcase (a performance intended for an industry audience, usually not as good as a show for a general audience). If it's meant to depict the unfortunate realization of unrecognized talent, it feels mean spirited. Despite this criticism, I am comfortable recommending the film, as Mr. Pepitone is genuinely funny, but I add the caveat that it will be most enjoyed by comedy fans and those who know the entertainment business rather than civilians who have had no exposure to what happens behind the scenes while they're laughing.

1988,The Blair Witch Project,"The Blair Witch Project follows a trio of filmmakers on what should have been a simple walk in the woods, but quickly becomes an excursion into heart-stopping terror. As the three become inexplicably lost, morale deteriorates. Hunger sets in. Accusations fly. As the end of their journey approaches, they realize that what they are filming now is not a legend...but their own descent into unimaginable horror.","Combining Hi-8 video with black-and-white 16 mm film, this film presents a raw look at what can happen when college students forego common sense and enter the world of voodoo and witchcraft. Presented as a straightforward documentary, the film opens with a title card explaining that in 1994, three students went into the Maryland back woods to do a film project on the Blair Witch incidents. These kids were never seen again, and the film you are about to see is from their recovered equipment, found in the woods a year later. The entire movie documents their adventures leading up to their final minutes. The Blair Witch incident, as we initially learn from the local town elders, is an old legend about a group of witches who tortured and killed several children many years ago. Everyone in town knows the story and they're all sketchy on the details. Out in the woods and away from their parked car (and civilization), what starts as a school exercise turns into a nightmare when the three kids lose their map. Forced to spend extra days finding their way out, the kids then start to hear horrific sounds outside their tents in the pitch-black middle of night. They also find strange artifacts from (what can only be) the Blair Witch, still living in the woods. Frightened, they desperately try to find their way out of the woods, with no luck. Slowly these students start to unravel, knowing they have no way of getting out, no food, and it's getting cold. Each night they are confronted with shrieking and sounds so haunting that they are convinced someone is following them, and they quickly begin to fear for their lives.

3117,The Blind Side,"The story of Michael Oher, a homeless and traumatized boy who became an All American football player and first round NFL draft pick with the help of a caring woman and her family.
Based on the true story of Leigh Anne and Sean Tuohy who take in a homeless teenage African-American, Michael ""Big Mike"" Oher. Michael has no idea who his father is and his mother is a drug addict. Michael has had little formal education and few skills to help him learn. Leigh Anne soon takes charge however, as is her nature, ensuring that the young man has every opportunity to succeed. When he expresses an interest in football, she goes all out to help him, including giving the coach a few ideas on how best to use Michael's skills. They not only provide him with a loving home, but hire a tutor to help him improve his grades to the point where he would qualify for an NCAA Division I athletic scholarship. Michael Oher was the first-round pick of the Baltimore Ravens in the 2009 NFL draft.
Taken in by a well-to-do family and offered a second chance at life, a homeless teen grows to become the star athlete projected to be the first pick at the NFL draft in this sports-themed comedy drama inspired by author Michael Lewis' best-seller The Blind Side: Evolution of a Game. Michael Oher was living on the streets when he was welcomed into the home of a conservative suburban family, but over time he matured into a talented athlete. As the NFL draft approaches, fans and sports radio personalities alike speculate that Oher will be the hottest pick of the year.

 John Lee Hancock

Stars:
 Quinton Aaron, Sandra Bullock, Tim McGraw 

","For most of his childhood, 17-year-old Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron) has been in foster care with different families, largely because of his mother's drug addiction, throughout Memphis, Tennessee. Every time he is placed in a new home, he runs away. His friend's father, whose couch Mike had been sleeping on, asks Burt Cotton (Ray McKinnon), the coach of Wingate Christian school, to help enroll his son and Mike. Impressed by Mike's size and athleticism, Cotton gets him admitted despite his abysmal academic record.
At his new school, Michael is befriended by a boy named Sean Jr. ""SJ"" (Jae Head). SJ's mother Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) is a strong-minded interior designer and the wife of wealthy businessman Sean Tuohy (Tim McGraw). Leigh Anne notices Michael walking on the road, shivering in the cold; when she learns he intends to spend the night huddled outside the school gym, she offers him a place to sleep at her house. The next morning, when she sees Michael leaving, she asks him to spend the Thanksgiving holiday with her family. Slowly, Michael becomes a member of the Tuohy family, even as Leigh Anne's rich friends wonder what she is doing. One even suggests that her teenage daughter Collins (Lily Collins) is not safe around him, much to Leigh Anne's disgust.
When Leigh Anne seeks to become Michael's legal guardian, she learns he was separated from his drug-addict mother when he was seven and that no one knows her whereabouts. She is also told that even though he scored low in almost every category in a career aptitude test, he is in the 98th percentile in ""protective instincts"".
After his grades improve, Michael is allowed to join the school football team. He has a shaky start due to his polite and gentle nature, yet after some encouragement by Leigh Anne to tap into his ""protective instincts"" and regard his teammates as he would members of his family, Michael dominates on the field. SJ sends out videos of the games to college coaches around the country. Leigh Anne discovers that to get a NCAA Division I scholarship, Michael needs a 2.5 GPA, so they hire a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates). Some of the teachers help out as well, and Michael ends up with a GPA of 2.52.
When coaches come to recruit Michael, Leigh Anne makes it clear that she prefers the University of Mississippi (Ole Miss) as both she and her husband are alumni. Miss Sue, another Ole Miss alumna, tells Michael (who dislikes horror films) that the FBI buries body parts under the University of Tennessee's Neyland Stadium for research; Leigh Anne particularly loathes that school. Michael commits to Ole Miss.
Subsequently, Michael and the Tuohys become the subject of an NCAA investigation. The investigator tells Michael that the Tuohys and Miss Sue are fervent Mississippi boosters, who are subject to special restrictions, and his high school coach got a job at Ole Miss after Michael chose the school. Michael confronts Leigh Anne, asking her if she only took him in so he would play football for her alma mater. Michael then goes to his birth mother's apartment in the projects. His old friends welcome him, but their leader makes crude remarks about Leigh Anne and Collins. Michael becomes angry and in the ensuing fight subdues his former friends and then flees.
Leigh Anne searches for Michael. He finally calls her, and they meet. Leigh Anne tells him she will support any decision he makes. Michael satisfies the investigator by explaining that he chose Ole Miss because his whole family has gone there.
Later, Leigh Anne and her family take Michael to the Ole Miss campus to begin college. The film ends with an emotional goodbye between Leigh Anne and Michael. The closing credits show the 2009 NFL Draft with the real Michael Oher being drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the first round. Photographs of Oher and the real Tuohys follow, with Oher's success in the NFL detailed. The credits include a dedication to director John Lee Hancock's father, a football player and coach who died in 2009.","gentle giant,football fan,adopted son,high school graduation,pep talk,uplifting,chance,adoptee,fortune,adopted,abuse,ncaa,adoptive mother,adoptive family,football star,hypocrisy,democrat,anticipation,7 series,protection,college recruitment,cheerleading,good luck,hero,belief,memphis tennessee,high school,act of kindness,drugs,cocaine,crack,protective mother,son,compassion,southern woman,huge,grace,drug use,mother,homeless,bmw,based on book,big,christian,big and tall,real life,christianity,slums,joy,obesity,x5,homeless teenager,football practice,captivating,drug addict,graduation,training,poverty,fate opportunity,surrogate mother,tutor,redneck,crack cocaine,athlete,interracial adoption,running away,defense,adoption,drug dealer,sentimental,scholarship,trust,nfl,car crash,tackle,cheerleader,football stadium,left tackle,trust in your heart,draft,football,true story,emotional,american football,touching,savior,fish out of water,feel good,football team,brother,private school,giant",3117.jpg,2009-11-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-blind-side/id348180373?uo=4,KA56LqFszYI,,,"Comedy,Drama,Sports & Fitness"

A warrior not by choice but necessity, Eli (Denzel Washington) seeks only peace but, if challenged, will cut his attackers down before they realize their fatal mistake. It's not his life he guards so fiercely but his hope for the future; a hope he has carried and protected for 30 years and is determined to realize.

2557,The Bourne Identity,"The best-selling suspense novel by late author Robert Ludlum comes to the screen for a second time, following a 1988 made-for-TV movie. Matt Damon stars as Jason Bourne, a barely alive amnesiac with a pair of bullet wounds in his back, pulled from the Mediterranean by Italian fishermen. Bourne's only clue to his own identity is a bank account number etched on a capsule implanted in his body. He quickly finds the Zurich bank where money, a gun, and a few identification documents await, but after he's pursued by security goons at the American consulate, Bourne realizes he can trust no one and offers a German gypsy named Marie (Franka Potente) ten thousand dollars for a ride to Paris. Encountering more professional killers bent on his destruction, Bourne discovers that he possesses a surprising degree of skill in combat, martial arts, and linguistics -- handy talents that clearly indicate his past includes work as a spy and assassin, but for whom? With Marie's reluctant help, Bourne edges closer to the truth, something CIA officials want concealed at all costs.","In the Mediterranean Sea near Marseille, Italian fishermen rescue an unconscious man floating adrift with two gunshot wounds in his back. The boat's medic finds a tiny laser projector surgically implanted under the unknown man's skin at the level of the hip. When activated, the laser projector displays the number of a safe deposit box in Z‚àö¬∫rich. The man wakes up and discovers he is suffering from extreme memory loss. Over the next few days on the ship, the man finds he is fluent in several languages and has unusual skills, but cannot remember anything about himself or why he was in the sea. When the ship docks, he sets off to investigate the safe deposit box.
At CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, Deputy Director Ward Abbott learns about a failed assassination attempt against exiled African dictator Nykwana Wombosi. Meanwhile, in Z‚àö¬∫rich, the amnesiac incapacitates two policemen using advanced hand-to-hand combat when they attempt to arrest him. The next morning, he visits a bank using the number that was embedded in his hip, and opens a safe deposit box to find several passports containing his picture (all under different names and nationalities), large amounts of assorted currencies, and a handgun. As the man assumes he is American (he speaks with an American accent), he takes the name from the American passport, Jason Bourne. He takes all the passports and money, but leaves the handgun.
As he leaves, a bank employee contacts Operation Treadstone, a CIA black ops program. After being chased by police, Bourne escapes into a U.S. consulate where he is again pursued by authorities. Bourne escapes and encounters a German woman named Marie Kreutz, offering her $20,000 to drive him to an address in Paris. Meanwhile, Alexander Conklin, the head of Treadstone, assures Abbott that he will destroy any evidence connecting them to Bourne, who was responsible for the failed assassination attempt on Wombosi. He activates three ""assets"" to take down Bourne: Castel, Manheim, and The Professor.
Bourne arrives at the address on his passport, and after studying the apartment, hits redial on his phone and is connected to the Hotel Regina. As John Michael Kane, one of the passport aliases, he is identified and Bourne is informed that Kane died two weeks earlier in a car crash. Castel ambushes Bourne and Marie at the apartment, but Bourne manages to defeat him after a fight and attempts to interrogate him unsuccessfully. Marie finds wanted posters in Castel's bag with both her and Bourne's pictures on them; as Bourne attempts to calm her down, Castel jumps out of a window to his death. Marie goes into shock, and Bourne escorts her from the building.
Conklin plants a body in a Paris morgue in an attempt to fool Wombosi that Kane is dead, but Wombosi recognizes that the body is not his assailant. The Professor assassinates Wombosi at his home. As Bourne investigates Wombosi he concludes that he must have been an assassin prior to his amnesia. He and Marie leave the city and travel into the French countryside to stay with Marie's stepbrother Eamon. In the morning, The Professor comes to kill Bourne. Bourne sends Marie and Eamon to hide in the basement, while he grabs Eamon's shotgun and goes out to find The Professor, blowing up a large propane tank as a distraction. After a brief standoff in a cropfield, Bourne shoots The Professor twice and interrogates him briefly. The Professor reveals their mutual connection to Treadstone before dying. Bourne sends Marie away for her own safety. He contacts Conklin to arrange a meet, but instead tracks Conklin's vehicle to discover the location of Treadstone's safe house in Paris.
Bourne breaks in and holds Conklin and logistics technician Nicky Parsons at gunpoint, beginning to remember his last mission through successive flashbacks. ""Kane"" was an assumed identity during his mission to infiltrate Wombosi's entourage and kill him, but Bourne failed to kill Wombosi aboard his yacht when he intended to because his children were sleeping nearby. Bourne fled and was shot twice in the back in the process. Bourne tells Conklin that he is leaving Treadstone and warns not to follow him. Realizing that their conversation is being overheard, Bourne leaves Conklin and Parsons before killing two agents who try to kill him. Abbott shuts down Treadstone and has Manheim kill Conklin. Abbott goes before an oversight committee, dismissing Treadstone and previewing a new project codenamed ""Blackbriar"". Some time later, Jason finds Marie renting out scooters to tourists in Greece, and the two reunite.","reminder,remember,cia agent,fugitive,stylized,man hunt,who am i,secret agent,who is that,wrong direction,anticipation,flashback,dark past,cia,momentum,undercover,rough,memory,multiple identities,distrust,exciting,amnesia,move forward,familiar,secret past,suspenseful,assassin,coming back to me,stabbed with a pen,surprise,backbone,fear",2557.jpg,2002-06-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-bourne-identity/id274225325?uo=4,2tqK_3mKQUw,,,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense"
862,The Bourne Supremacy,"The second chapter in the ""Bourne Trilogy,"" based on Robert Ludlum's best-selling espionage novels, reaches the screen in this sequel to the 2002 thriller The Bourne Identity. Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) has abandoned his life as a CIA assassin and has been traveling beneath the agency's radar, eventually reconnecting with Marie Kreutz (Franka Potente), the woman he loves. But Bourne is haunted by vivid dreams and troubling memories of his days as a killer, and he's not certain how much really happened and how much is a product of his imagination. When Bourne is led out of hiding by circumstances beyond his control, he must reconcile his past and present as he struggles to keep Marie out of harm's way and foil an international incident with dangerous consequences. The Bourne Supremacy also features Joan Allen as one of Bourne's superiors, while Julia Stiles and Brian Cox reprise their roles as intelligence agents from the first film.","Two years after their escape from France, Jason Bourne and Marie Kreutz are now in Goa, India. Still experiencing flashbacks about his former life as a CIA assassin, he records them in a notebook.
Meanwhile, in Berlin, CIA agents subordinate to Deputy Director Pamela Landy are paying US$3 million for the ""Neski files"", documents on the theft of $20 million in allocation money seven years earlier. Russian Federal Security Service agent Kirill plants Bourne's fingerprint to frame him, kills the agents, and steals the files and money, giving them to his employer, Russian oil oligarch Yuri Gretkov. Kirill travels to Goa to kill Bourne, but Bourne spots him and flees with Marie. As the couple drive away, Kirill attempts to shoot Bourne, but kills Marie by mistake. Their vehicle goes off a bridge and into a river; Kirill believes that Bourne is dead.
Bourne survives and leaves for Naples, Italy, with money and passports. After finding the fingerprint Kirill planted, Landy learns that it belongs to Bourne and subsequently asks Deputy Director Ward Abbott about Operation Treadstone. Landy tells Abbott that the CIA agent who stole the $20 million was named in the stolen files. Some years ago, Russian politician Vladimir Neski was about to identify the thief when he was supposedly murdered by his wife in a Berlin hotel. Landy believes that Bourne and the late Treadstone supervisor Alexander Conklin were somehow involved, and assumes that Bourne killed her two agents. Both Abbott and Landy go to Berlin to find Bourne and take him down.
In Naples, Bourne allows himself to be identified by security. He subdues his CIA interrogator, copies the SIM card from his cell phone, and learns from a subsequent phone call about Landy and what she thinks Bourne did. Bourne goes to Munich to visit the only other remaining Treadstone operative, Jarda, who informs Bourne that Treadstone was shut down after Conklin's death. Jarda tries to incapacitate Bourne before an incoming CIA team arrives, but Bourne kills him, blows up his house, and escapes. Bourne follows Landy and Abbott as they meet former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons to question her about her past experience with him. Believing that the CIA is hunting him again, Bourne calls Landy and is told that he is being pursued because he killed two people in Berlin‚Äö√Ñ√Æthough she is not referring to Bourne's recent flashbacks.
Bourne arranges to meet Nicky at the Alexanderplatz, where he kidnaps and interrogates her, finding out that Abbott was the head of Treadstone, not Conklin. He remembers that he murdered Neski in Berlin, but Parsons knows nothing about it. Bourne visits the hotel where the killing took place and remembers more of his mission‚Äö√Ñ√Æhe killed Neski on Conklin's orders, and when Neski's wife showed up, he shot her to make it look like a murder‚Äö√Ñ√¨suicide. Abbott kills his own assistant once he realizes that the assistant suspects a conspiracy against Bourne, who breaks into Abbott's hotel room and records a conversation between him and Gretkov that incriminates them in the theft of the money. Abbott confesses to ordering the assassination in Goa, Neski's murder by Bourne, and the murder of the agents by Kirill, for which Bourne was to be framed. When Landy suspects Bourne's innocence and confronts Abbott, he commits suicide. Bourne sends the tape of the confession to Landy, vindicating himself.
Bourne goes to Moscow to find Irena Neski, the daughter of Vladimir Neski. Kirill tracks down Bourne and wounds him in the shoulder. Bourne reaches a car and Kirill engages him in a high-speed car chase, ending after Bourne forces his car into a concrete divider. After seeing that Kirill is critically injured, he lowers his gun and walks away. Bourne locates Neski and apologizes for murdering her parents. Gretkov is arrested by Landy, using the evidence she got from Bourne. Some time later, in New York City, she receives a phone call from Bourne; she expresses her thanks for the tape of Abbott's confession before telling Bourne his real name is David Webb and that he was born ""4-15-71"" in Nixa, Missouri. Bourne tells her that she looks tired, indicating that he can see her, before hanging up and fading into a New York crowd.","red square,knife,hand to hand combat,dark past,berlin germany,loss of loved one,lie,suicide,goa india,stylized,italy,india,gun,espionage,brawl,taxi,false passport,revenge,tough guy,on the run,martial arts,anticipation,amnesia,fist fight,one against many,amsterdam netherlands,sequel,sniper,swat team,vodka,rough,telephone call,new york city,one man crusade,napoli italy,cia agent,death of loved one,action hero,manhattan new york city,surprise,betrayal,suspense,taxi,knife fight,cia,chase,hero,hidden truth,moscow,india,spy,flashback,tunnel chase,assassin,gunfight,distrust of government,secret past,carabinieri,car chase,assasin,memory,one man army,crime confession,red,handgun,silencer,suspenseful,strangulation,moscow russia,russia,atonement,germany,subway,fear",862.jpg,2004-07-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-bourne-supremacy/id277223201?uo=4,ofMkaGkyAPw,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
3132,The Bourne Ultimatum,"Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) races to solve the mystery of his past while being hunted by members of the very organization he was hired into as director Paul Greengrass brings author Robert Ludlum's popular character back to the big screen for his third feature outing. David Strathairn, Julia Stiles, Joan Allen, and Paddy Considine co-star","Having been wounded by a gunshot from the Russian assassin Kirill, Jason Bourne evades Moscow police and goes into hiding. Six weeks later, he goes to Paris to inform Martin Kreutz of the death of his sister Marie, who had been Bourne's girlfriend. The Guardian correspondent Simon Ross meets with someone to discuss Bourne and Operation Treadstone. The CIA begin tracking Ross after he mentions ""Operation Blackbriar"" over a cell phone call. Bourne learns of Ross's investigation of Treadstone and they secretly meet at Waterloo Station. Bourne realizes that the CIA is tracking Ross and helps him evade capture, but Ross deviates from Bourne's instructions and is killed by Blackbriar assassin Paz, on orders from Blackbriar's director Noah Vosen.
Pamela Landy, who had unsuccessfully hunted Bourne six weeks earlier, is brought in to help Vosen. They search Ross's notes and find that Ross's source was Neal Daniels, the CIA station chief in Madrid, who was formerly involved in Treadstone and is involved in Blackbriar. Bourne makes his way to Daniels' Madrid office, but finds it empty. After Bourne incapacitates a CIA team sent by Vosen and Landy, Nicky Parsons, a former Treadstone support technician arrives. She decides to help Bourne and tells him that Daniels has fled to Tangier.
Upon arriving in Tangier, Parsons tries to track Daniels' location but is unable to, finding that Blackbriar ""asset"" Desh Bouksani has been tasked with killing Daniels. Vosen learns that Parsons logged in to access information about Daniels and sends Desh after Parsons and Bourne, a decision Landy disagrees with. Bourne follows Desh to Daniels, but fails to prevent Daniels' death by a planted bomb. Bourne manages to kill Desh before he can kill Parsons, and subsequently sends Parsons into hiding. Bourne examines the contents of Daniels' charred briefcase and finds the address of the deep cover CIA bureau in New York City where Vosen directs Blackbriar.
Bourne travels to New York City. Landy receives a phone call from Bourne (in a repetition of the final scene of The Bourne Supremacy), which is revealed to be tapped by Vosen. Landy thanks Bourne for the tape he sent her which revealed the corrupt dealings of former Treadstone director Ward Abbott; she also tells him that his real name is David Webb and his birthdate is ""4-15-71"". Bourne tells Landy to ""get some rest"" because she ""looks tired"", which she and Vosen both understand to mean that Bourne is watching her. Vosen intercepts a text to Landy from Bourne of a location to meet up and leaves his office with a team to follow Landy and capture Bourne. Bourne breaks into Vosen's office and steals classified Blackbriar documents. Vosen sends Paz after Bourne, the two finally encountering each other in a car chase which ends with Paz forcing Bourne's car to crash into a concrete barrier. Bourne gets out and holds Paz at gunpoint before sparing his life and continuing on to 415 East 71st Street, memories of which were triggered by the false birthday he was given by Landy. Vosen also figures out Landy's code and warns Dr. Albert Hirsch, who ran Treadstone's behavior modification program, that Bourne is coming.
Landy meets Bourne at the building, where Bourne gives her the Blackbriar files before going inside. Landy starts faxing the files to an unknown receiver, but is found by Vosen as the last page is sent. Bourne encounters Hirsch in an upper level and, with Hirsch's help, remembers that he volunteered for Treadstone. He then states that he is no longer Jason Bourne and flees to the roof from Vosen's pursuing CIA team. Bourne is confronted on the roof by Paz, who asks Bourne why he did not kill him. Bourne asks Paz if he even knows why he is supposed to kill him and repeats the dying words of The Professor‚Äö√Ñ√Æa Treadstone assassin Bourne had killed years earlier‚Äö√Ñ√Æ""Look at us. Look at what they make you give."" Paz lowers his gun as Bourne runs to jump off the roof, but Vosen appears and shoots at Bourne as he leaps into the East River below. Some time later, Parsons watches a television news broadcast about the exposure of Operation Blackbriar, the arrests of Hirsch and Vosen, a criminal investigation of CIA director Ezra Kramer, and David Webb, a.k.a. Jason Bourne, who was reportedly shot and fell into the East River. Upon hearing that his body has not been found after a three-day search, Parsons smiles. Bourne is shown swimming away underwater after his fall.","hand to hand combat,dark past,shootout,pursuit,stylized,corruption,disobey,london england,espionage,revelation,brawl,consciousness,memory,tough guy,madrid spain,martial arts,anticipation,fist fight,sniper,tangier morocco,rough,safecracking,newspaper,exciting,new york city,new york,one man crusade,cia agent,torture,security leak,mixed martial arts,action hero,assassination,scapegoat,surprise,roof chase,code name,pistol,hacking,car accident,conspiracy,villain arrested,chase,hero,man hunt,hidden truth,evading,spy,flashback,warrior,assassin,alternate identity,distrust of government,hotwire,driving backwards,secret past,sniper rifle,langley virginia,alarm,spy hero,one man army,dog tag,silencer,suspenseful,strangulation,moscow russia,showdown,fear",3132.jpg,2007-07-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-bourne-ultimatum/id274094801?uo=4,reotzNITIeQ,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Successful sportswriter Joe Warr (Owen) finds himself completely unprepared to raise his rambunctious 6yearold son Artie and juggle the challenges of a demanding job, running a household and the possibility of romance. Determined to bring joy back into their lives, he develops a revolutionary approach to parenting no rules, no chores. It's a home filled with love and chaos and then Joe's estranged teenage son comes for a visit. Inspired by a true story and filled with emotional honesty, this poignant film will touch your heart and lift your spirits.","Prime Suspect writer Allan Cubitt adapts U.K. sportswriter Simon Carr's autobiographical novel about a successful sports journalist who is suddenly saddled with the responsibility of raising two sons from different marriages, and whose unusual parenting philosophy ""just say yes"" brings them closer together than ever before. A quick witted rogue with a talent for covering sports, Joe Warr (Clive Owen) never took life seriously -- until the day his beloved wife died in the blink of an eye. But while Joe is absolutely overwhelmed with grief after losing his spirited soul mate, his six-year-old son, Artie (Nicholas McAnulty), is taking it even harder. Artie can't accept his mother's passing, and his troubling means of expressing his grief are only serving to make a bad situation worse. Suddenly, into the chaos of Joe's and Artie's lives wanders rebellious teenager named Harry (George MacKay). Harry is Joe's son from a previous marriage, and he's come from England to live with his father and stepbrother. Upon realizing that he's neither emotionally prepared nor equipped to take on the responsibility of being a single parent, Joe decides to throw the rules out the window and ""just say yes"" to every question his sons pose. The result is a household that's full of jubilance and energy, but constantly on the verge of calamity. Somehow, in the midst of all the chaos, something incredible happens -- the bereaved father and his two sons find the courage to move past their grief, and rediscover the joy of living.","bittersweet,touching",1095.jpg,2009-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-boys-are-back/id432470196?uo=4,2019,,,Drama

2353,The Breakfast Club,"They were five students with nothing in common, faced with spending a Saturday detention together in their high school library. At 7 a.m., they had nothing to say, but by 4 p.m. they had bared their souls to each other and become good friends. John Hughes, creator of the critically acclaimed Sixteen Candles, wrote, directed and produced this hilarious and often touching comedy starring Emilio Estevez, Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, Molly Ringwald and Ally Sheedy. To the outside world they were simply the Jock, the Brain, the Criminal, the Princess and the Kook, but to each other, they would always be The Breakfast Club.","Five students ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ ""criminal"" John Bender (Nelson), ""athlete"" Andrew Clark (Estevez), ""brain"" Brian Johnson (Hall), ""basket case"" Allison Reynolds (Sheedy), and ""princess"" Claire Standish (Ringwald) ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ report for Saturday morning detention on March 24, 1984 at Shermer High School in the Chicago suburb of Shermer, Illinois. While not complete strangers, each of them comes from a different clique, and they seem to have nothing in common. They gather in the high school library, where they are ordered not to speak or move from their seats or sleep by the assistant principal, Richard Vernon (Gleason). They are to remain there for a period of eight hours, fifty-four minutes (from 7:06 A.M. to 4 P.M.). He assigns a 1000-word essay (in which each student must write about who he or she thinks they are) and then leaves, returning occasionally to check on them. Bender, who has a particularly negative relationship with Vernon, disregards the rules and riles the other students, mocking Brian and Andrew, and harassing Claire. Allison is initially quiet except for the occasional random outburst.
The students pass the hours by arguing and smoking marijuana that Bender retrieves from his locker. Gradually they open up to each other and reveal their inner secrets ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ for example, Allison is a compulsive liar, Andrew hates his father, Bender comes from an abusive household, Brian has contemplated suicide, and Claire is a virgin. They also discover that they all have strained relationships with their parents and are afraid of making the same mistakes as the adults around them. However, despite these developing friendships the students are afraid that once the detention is over, they will return to their very different cliques and never speak to each other again.
Towards the end of the day, the other students ask Brian to write the essay that Vernon assigned earlier. Brian does so, but instead of writing about the assigned topic, he writes a letter to Vernon objecting to his request to describe to him who they are, stating that the man has already judged who they are (an athlete, basket case, princess, brain, and criminal), and that he will not accept any different accounts from them. Brian signs the essay as ""The Breakfast Club"" and leaves it at the table for Vernon to read when they leave at 4 P.M. Before the students part ways outside the school, Allison and Andrew kiss, and so do Claire and Bender.","discussion,revelation,teenage rebellion,drug humor,wrestler,abuse,angst,delinquent,joke,humor,virgin,shermer,dandruff,cross functional team,defiance,brat pack,geek,lying,high school,troubled,the world is an imperfect place,teenage angst,school life,mishief,gay slur,jock,surprise,highschool,joy,rejection,suicidal,prom queen,miss my friends,problem with authority,high school teacher,smoking,detention,loner,opposites attract,jealousy,child abuse,trust,self acceptance,virginity,humorous,marijuana,screws fall out all the time,self discovery,insult,clever,teen angst,student teacher,friends forever,kiss,loser,misfit,teenager,wonder,teenage girl,anticipation,woonder,argument,1980s,smoking pot,confrontation,bully,pink panties,dysfunctional,endure,peer pressure,rebellion,suburbia,sadness,boredom,liar,teen movie,popular student,teenage,teenage boy,compulsive liar,kleptomania,abusive father,coming of age,acceptance,conformity,juvenile delinquent,attempted suicide,popularity,confession,students,troubled teen,sincere,lipstick,student athlete,self esteem,prank,lipstick trick,practical joke",2353.jpg,1985-02-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-breakfast-club/id280360440?uo=4,dkX8J-FKndE,,,"Comedy,Drama"

2918,The Butterfly Effect,"Final Destination 2 screenwriters Eric Bress and J. Mackye Gruber make their directorial debut with the sci-fi thriller The Butterfly Effect. Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher with facial hair) wants to free himself from his disturbing childhood memories. As a kid, he often blacked out for long periods of time and tried to detail his life in a journal. As a young adult, he revisits the journal entries to figure out the truth about his troubled childhood friends Kayleigh (Amy Smart), Lenny (Elden Henson), and Tommy (William Lee Scott). When he discovers he can travel back in time in order to set things right, he tries to save his beloved friends. However, he finds out that relatively minor changes can make major problems for the future. The Butterfly Effect also stars Eric Stoltz, Ethan Suplee, and Melora Walters. The title was inspired by the story A Sound of Thunder by Ray Bradbury.","In the year 2002, Evan Treborn (Ashton Kutcher) frequently suffers from blackouts, often at moments of high stress. As a young child (played by Logan Lerman) and adolescent (played by John Patrick Amedori), Evan suffered many severe sexual and psychological traumas. These traumas include being forced to take part in child pornography, being strangled by his mentally-ill father, causing an accident with dynamite with his friends, and seeing his dog being burned by his friend. Seven years later, while ""entertaining"" a girl in his dorm room, he realizes that when he reads from his adolescent journals, he can travel back in time, and is able to ""redo"" parts of his past. His time traveling episodes account for the frequent blackouts he experienced as a child. However, there are consequences to his choices that propagate back to his present life, his alternate personal futures progress from college student, to prisoner, to amputee. His efforts are driven by the desire to undo the most unpleasant events of his childhood which coincide with his mysterious blackouts, including saving his childhood sweetheart Kayleigh (Amy Smart) from being molested by her father (Eric Stoltz) and tormented by her sadistic brother (William Lee Scott).
The actions he takes, and enables others to take during his blackouts, change the timeline in the new future where he awakes. As he continues to do this he realizes that even though his intentions are good, his actions have unforeseen consequences. Moreover, the assimilation of dozens of years' worth of new memories from the alternate timelines causes his brain damage and severe nosebleeds. Ultimately, he decides that his attempts to alter the past end up only harming those he cares about, and realizes that the main cause of everyone's suffering in all the different timelines is himself.
At the conclusion of the film, Evan purposely travels back in time one final time to the day he meets Kayleigh as a child. He purposefully upsets her so she will live with her mother instead of her father, never meet him, and therefore live a good life without him.","scary, consequences,mistakes,choice,vision,learn from the past,retribution,stylized,mind bending,vortex,deja vu,effect,hindsight,suspenseful,connections,choose",2918.jpg,2004-01-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-butterfly-effect/id291735193?uo=4,RR9MsNurndQ,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
7295,The Cabin In The Woods,"Five friends go to a remote cabin in the woods. Bad things happen. If you think you know this story, think again. From fan favorites Joss Whedon and Drew Goddard comes The Cabin in the Woods, a mind blowing horror film that turns the genre inside out.","Drew Goddard and Joss Whedon deconstructed the rules of horror in head-scratching fashion by revealing why so many na‚àö√òve young kids are prepared to unleash hell in a rural retreat. The twists mount up from the first scene until the entire genre has been turned inside-out. You'll never watch a traditional horror film in the same way again.

The opening credits of The Cabin In The Woods see Egyptian etchings of ritual sacrifices shimmering in blobs of CG blood. A strange juxtaposition, intriguing.

Then come Hieronymus Bosch-style paintings of writhing, torn bodies arranged into hellishly elaborate torture shows. Cut to‚Äö√Ñ¬∂ two middle-aged office workers (Richard Jenkins, Bradley Whitford) driving down the street, discussing the day‚Äö√Ñ√¥s work before them: grey environment, white shirts and, for a horror movie promising nubile teens in stock scenarios, unexpected.

Slam! THE CABIN IN THE WOODS (block caps, blood red) takes up the entire width and depth of the screen. Then we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re on campus listening to MOR rock and watching hottie Jules (Anna Hutchison), jock Curt (Chris Hemsworth, pre-Thor), scholar Holden (Jesse Williams), virgin (well, almost‚Äö√Ñ¬∂) Dana (Kristen Connolly) and stoner Marty (Fran Kranz) loading up a camper van.

They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re heading to a cabin in the woods, but as for everything else, all bets are off... So shrewd and playful is this mainstream horror-comedy by Drew Goddard (whose writing credits include Lost, Alias, Cloverfield, Angel and Buffy The Vampire Slayer, here making his directing bow) and Joss Whedon (director of Avengers Assemble, Serenity... wait, this is old news), you just know the clich‚àö¬©s are there for a reason.

It starts with the archetypal characters and continues with their encounter, en route, with a local redneck (aka The Harbinger). ‚Äö√Ñ√∫I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ve seen plenty come and go,‚Äö√Ñ√π he gravely intones, and moments later the camera is offering the obligatory overhead shot of their vehicle wending its way up a mountain road. OK, time out.

You know that bit in movie reviews where the journalist bleats about how they can‚Äö√Ñ√¥t say any more because it would give too much away? Well, this is it. And this time you better believe it, because to even talk about The Cabin In The Woods in general terms, with evasive hints and contextual references, is to alert viewers to dog-leg plot turns they‚Äö√Ñ√¥d be better off stumbling upon alone.

Still here? OK, don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t say we didn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t warn you. A postmodern celebration and dissection of the horror genre, The Cabin In The Woods delivers few tics and tricks we haven‚Äö√Ñ√¥t seen before. But Halloween did little that hadn‚Äö√Ñ√¥t been done before either, and nor, for that matter, did Citizen Kane; the beauty of Cabin is that it takes bits and pieces from here, there and everywhere and blends them into a vibrant entertainment.

One of the central conceits ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ that horror movies tap into our subconscious fears, which are rooted in ancient and primal terrors ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ was explored in Wes Craven‚Äö√Ñ√¥s New Nightmare (‚Äö√Ñ√∫They‚Äö√Ñ√¥re like something from our nightmares,‚Äö√Ñ√π says one of Cabin‚Äö√Ñ√¥s characters. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫No, they‚Äö√Ñ√¥re something our nightmares are from,‚Äö√Ñ√π replies another), while Scream, Cube, Hostel, My Little Eye and Behind The Mask: The Rise Of Leslie Vernon explore other ideas stashed in the Cabin.

Individual movies are explicitly referenced (Hellraiser, The Creature From The Black Lagoon, The Evil Dead, The Strangers) and sub-genres nodded to (torture porn, zombies, werewolves, monster movies, the mythic, gigantic beasts of H.P. Lovecraft and, in two hilarious sequences, J-horror).  

Of course, it‚Äö√Ñ√¥s arguable that all this pulling back of the curtain and drawing attention to the genre‚Äö√Ñ√¥s mechanics hinders viewers from truly investing in the characters: we are, after all, watching a movie, a fact we‚Äö√Ñ√¥re never allowed to forget.

But we certainly like the protagonists, who, it should be noted, subvert expectations as frequently as they cleave to them. The dialogue, meanwhile, is laugh-out-loud funny.

Take the scene where the friends huddle in the cabin‚Äö√Ñ√¥s basement surrounded by iconic bric-a-brac such as dolls, bridal gowns and puzzle boxes. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫I‚Äö√Ñ√¥m drawing a line in the fucking sand here,‚Äö√Ñ√π yelps pothead Marty as Dana opens a cobwebby journal. ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Do not read the Latin‚Äö√Ñ¬∂‚Äö√Ñ√π

It‚Äö√Ñ√¥s to Cabin‚Äö√Ñ√¥s credit that it still works so well despite being shelved for three years, first saddled with a post-Avatar 3D conversion (thankfully no more) and then buried by MGM‚Äö√Ñ√¥s filing for bankruptcy.

In the meantime, some of its tropes have surfaced in, bizarrely, Hostel: Part III, and, naturally, the fourth installment of Wes Craven‚Äö√Ñ√¥s famous franchise. But this is the real scream, sure to appeal to fans and non-fans alike.

A super-entertaining, super-slick love/hate letter to horror with a final 20 minutes that‚Äö√Ñ√¥s stunningly bonkers.

1642,The Captains,"Since first soaring onto television screens in the mid 1960s, Star Trek has become one of the most beloved franchises of all time. The original Captain Kirk, William Shatner, travels around the globe to interview the elite group of actors (Patrick Stewart, Chris Pine, Scott Bakula, Avery Brooks and more) who have portrayed the role of Enterprise Captain, giving fans an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the pop culture phenomenon.","The Captains is a feature length documentary film written and directed by William Shatner. The film follows Shatner as he interviews the other actors whom have portrayed Starship captains within the illustrious science-fiction franchise.
The Captains takes the audience on a voyage of discovery as pop culture phenom William Shatner interviews Sir Patrick Stewart (Captain Jean-Luc Picard Star Trek: The Next Generation), Avery Brooks (Captain Benjamin Sisko Star Trek: Deep Space Nine), Kate Mulgrew (Captain Kathryn Janeway, Star Trek: Voyager), Scott Bakula (Captain Jonathan Archer, Star Trek: Enterprise), and Chris Pine (Captain James T. Kirk, Star Trek 2009). With each of these celebrated actors Shatner explores the pressures and pitfalls that came along with donning the Starfleet uniform and reveals for the first time his own embarrassment over the role which made him a household name. With the help of his fellow captains Shatner learns to respect his work on the original Star Trek and finishes the film with a new perspective on life, death, and the legacy he will leave behind. The Captains also delves into each of the actors' lives and careers leading up to their landmark television performances. The film pays special attention to Shatner's own acting roots, tracking his journey from humble beginnings at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and CBC Radio, to headlining Broadway shows, and eventually getting his big break in Hollywood at the helm of Gene Roddenberry's ambitious brainchild. As an extra treat, whilst in Stratford, Ontario, Shatner sits down with his dear friend Christopher Plummer. The Canadian legend of the stage and screen was instrumental in Shatner's young career and was rewarded by the original captain years later with the role of bloodthirsty Klingon General Chang in Star Trek VI. The Captains is a unique documentary which examines much more than mere acting and the shows these people worked on. The film tells deep emotional tales of human beings struggling to do what they love most and perform to a high enough standard as to make all their sacrifices worth while. The Captains is also boundless fun as personified by its gregarious, charming, and surprisingly soulful host.

1838,The China Syndrome,"A reporter finds what appears to be a cover-up of safety hazards at a nuclear power plant.
While doing a series of reports on alternative energy sources, an opportunistic reporter Kimberly Wells witnesses an accident at a nuclear power plant. Wells is determined to publicise the incident but soon finds herself entangled in a sinister conspiracy to keep the full impact of the incident a secret.

This gripping 1979 drama about the dangers of nuclear power carried an extra jolt when a real-life accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear plant in Pennsylvania occurred just weeks after the film opened. Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) is a TV reporter trying to advance from fluff pieces to harder news. Wells and cameraman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas, who also produced) are doing a story on energy when they happen to witness a near-meltdown at a local nuclear plant, averted only by quick-thinking engineer Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon). While Wells and Adams fruitlessly attempt to get the story on their station, Godell begins his own investigation and discovers that corporate greed and cost-trimming have led to potentially deadly faults in the plant's construction. He provides evidence of the faulty equipment, which could lead to another meltdown (the ""China syndrome"" of the title), to the station's soundman to deliver to Wells and Adams at a hearing on nuclear power. However, on the way to the hearing, the soundman is run off the road by evil henchmen, leading Godell to realize that his own life is threatened, possibly by his bosses at the plant. Driven to the edge of a breakdown, Godell takes over the plant's control room at gunpoint and demands to reveal his findings on TV. The plant's management, however, has other plans, and the facility itself is becoming dangerously unstable. Whether or not you agree with the film's clear anti-nuclear bias, its sobering message and riveting, realistic story and performances are still difficult to ignore.

","While visiting the Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells (Fonda), her maverick cameraman Richard Adams (Douglas) and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down; then he finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control.
Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. When he shows the film to experts, they realize that the plant came close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam.
During an inspection of the plant before it's brought back online, a technician discovers a small puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing come in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and uncovers evidence that radiographs of welds on the leaking pump have been falsified (shot at the same angle). He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung, who brushes Godell off as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least $20 million. Godell confronts D.B. Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan, the construction company who built the plant, as it was Royce who signed off on the welding radiographs. When Godell threatens to go to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Royce threatens him and a pair of goons from Foster-Sullivan park outside his house.
Kimberly and Richard confront Godell at his home with what they know, at which point, the engineer voices his concern about the vibration he felt during the SCRAM and his anger about the false radiographs. Kimberly and Richard ask Godell if he'll come clean at NRC hearings, being held at Point Conception, where Foster-Sullivan is looking to build another nuclear plant. Godell tells them about the threat on his life, but agrees to get them, through Hector, the false radiographs to take to the hearings.
Following the exchange though, Hector is run off the road by company men and the radiographs are taken. Godell leaves for the hearings but is chased by the goons waiting outside his home. He escapes by taking refuge in the plant.
To his dismay, Godell finds that the reactor is being brought up to full power. He grabs a gun from a security guard, forces everyone out, including his best friend and co-worker Ted Spindler (Brimley), and demands to be interviewed on live television by Kimberly. Plant management agrees to the interview, which buys them time as they try to regain control of the plant.
Minutes into the broadcast, plant technicians deliberately cause a SCRAM so they can retake the control room (Ted was opposed to the SCRAM due to Godell's concerns about safety). While Godell is distracted by the SCRAM alarms a SWAT team forces its way into the control room. The television cable is cut and a panicky Godell is shot by the police, but before he dies he feels the unusual vibration again. The resulting SCRAM is only brought under control by the plant's automatic systems. True to Godell's predictions, the plant suffers significant damage as the pump malfunctions.
Plant officials try to paint Godell as emotionally disturbed, but Ted states that Godell would not have taken such drastic steps had there not been something wrong. The film ends with a tearful Kimberly concluding her report as the reporter's live signal abruptly cuts to color bars.","biting,disturbing,suspenseful,sincere,captivating",1838.jpg,1979-03-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-china-syndrome/id318477293?uo=4,6PJ-BzXAN1c,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Daisy asks Caroline to read to her aloud the diary of Daisy's lifelong friend, Benjamin Button. Benjamin's diary recounts his entire extraordinary life, the primary unusual aspect of which was his aging backwards, being diagnosed with several aging diseases at birth and thus given little chance of survival, but who does survive and gets younger with time. Abandoned by his biological father, Thomas Button, after Benjamin's biological mother died in childbirth, Benjamin was raised by Queenie, a black woman and caregiver at a seniors home. Daisy's grandmother was a resident at that home, which is where she first met Benjamin. Although separated through the years, Daisy and Benjamin remain in contact throughout their lives, reconnecting in their forties when in age they finally match up. Some of the revelations in Benjamin's diary are difficult for Caroline to read, especially as it relates to the time past this reconnection between Benjamin and Daisy, when Daisy gets older and Benjamin grows younger into his childhood years.

","In 2005, elderly Daisy is on her deathbed in a New Orleans hospital; she asks her daughter, Caroline, to read aloud from the diary of Benjamin Button. From the reading, we learn that on the evening of November 11, 1918, a boy is born with the appearance and physical maladies of an elderly man. The baby's mother died after giving birth, and the father, Thomas Button, abandons the infant on the porch of a nursing home. Queenie and Mr. ""Tizzy"" Weathers, workers at the nursing home, find the baby, and Queenie decides to care for him as her own.
Benjamin learns to walk in 1925; he declares it a miracle, after which he uses crutches in place of a wheelchair. On Thanksgiving 1930, Benjamin meets six-year-old Daisy, whose grandmother lives in the nursing home. Later, he accepts work on a tugboat captained by Mike. Benjamin also meets Thomas Button, who does not reveal that he is Benjamin's father. In autumn 1936, Benjamin leaves New Orleans for a long-term work engagement with the tugboat crew; Daisy later is accepted into a dance school in New York.
In 1941, Benjamin is in Murmansk, where he begins having an affair with Elizabeth Abbott, wife of the British Trade Minister. That December, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor, thrusting America into World War II. Mike volunteers the boat for the U.S. Navy; the crew is assigned to salvage duties. During a patrol, the tugboat finds a sunken U.S. transport and the bodies of 1,300 American troops. A German submarine surfaces; Mike steers the tugboat full speed towards it while a German gunner fires on the tugboat, killing most of the crew including Mike. The tugboat rams the submarine, causing it to explode, sinking both vessels. Benjamin and another crewman are rescued by U.S. Navy ships the next day.
In May 1945, Benjamin returns to New Orleans and reunites with Queenie. A few weeks later, he reunites with Daisy; they go out for dinner. Upon failing to seduce him afterward, she departs. Benjamin later reunites with Thomas Button, who, terminally ill, reveals he is Benjamin's father. Thomas wills Benjamin his possessions before he dies.
In 1947, Benjamin visits Daisy in New York unannounced, but departs upon seeing that she has fallen in love with someone else. In 1954, Daisy's dance career ends in Paris when a taxi cab crushes her leg. When Benjamin visits her, Daisy is amazed by his youthful appearance, but frustrated by her injuries, she tells him to stay out of her life.
In spring 1962, Daisy returns to New Orleans and reunites with Benjamin. Now of comparable physical age, they fall in love and go sailing together. Upon their return, they learn that Queenie has died; they move in together after the funeral. In 1967, Daisy has opened a ballet studio and tells Benjamin that she is pregnant; she gives birth to a girl, Caroline in spring 1968. Believing he cannot be a father to his daughter due to his reverse aging, Benjamin sells his belongings, leaves the proceeds to Daisy and Caroline, and departs the next spring; he travels alone during the 1970's.
Benjamin returns to Daisy in 1980. Now married, Daisy introduces him to her husband and daughter as a family friend. Daisy admits that he was right to leave; she could not have coped otherwise. She later visits Benjamin at his hotel, where they share their passion for each other. After saying their good-nights, Benjamin watches Daisy leave in a taxi from his window.
Sometime in the early 1990s, widowed Daisy is contacted by social workers who have found Benjamin ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ now physically a preteen. When she arrives, they explain that he was living in a condemned building and was taken to the hospital in poor health, and that they found her name in his diary. The bewildered social workers also say he is displaying early signs of dementia. Daisy moves into the nursing home in 1997 and cares for Benjamin for the rest of his life. In the spring of 2003, Benjamin dies in Daisy's arms, physically an infant but chronologically 84 years of age. Daisy dies on her deathbed as Hurricane Katrina approaches.","progeria,birth,unwanted child,rapid aging,foster mother,fountain of youth,anti aging,forever young,aging disorder,dying young,agism,button,indian chief motorcycle,deformed baby,old age,l'oreal,white hair,anticipation,expectant mother,adoptive mother,death,premature aging,healer,medical condition,older woman younger man relationship,child as adult,clarins,growing up,giving birth,surprise,skin condition,travel,ageing cream,sadness,aging,captivating,dancing,grown up,dementia,old man,nostalgia,offbeat,aging parent,aging,black & white to color,reverse,sentimental,backwards,death of baby,dying in childbirth,swimmer,make up,touching,contemplative,hair dye,bittersweet,atmospheric,pygmy,baby born,gloomy",347.jpg,2008-12-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/curious-case-benjamin-button/id307157292?uo=4,Y_e_XzgStHk,,,"Drama,Romance,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

","Dan Brown's controversial best-selling novel about a powerful secret that's been kept under wraps for thousands of years comes to the screen in this suspense thriller from director Ron Howard. The stately silence of Paris' Louvre museum is broken when one of the gallery's leading curators is found dead on the grounds, with strange symbols carved into his body and left around the spot where he died. Hoping to learn the significance of the symbols, police bring in Sophie Neveu (Audrey Tautou), a gifted cryptographer who is also the victim's granddaughter. Needing help, Sophie calls on Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), a leading symbologist from the United States. As Sophie and Robert dig deeper into the case, they discover the victim's involvement in the Priory of Sion, a secret society whose members have been privy to forbidden knowledge dating back to the birth of Christianity. In their search, Sophie and Robert happen upon evidence that could lead to the final resting place of the Holy Grail, while members of the priory and an underground Catholic society known as Opus Dei give chase, determined to prevent them from sharing their greatest secrets with the world. Also starring Ian McKellen, Jean Reno, and Alfred Molina, The Da Vinci Code was shot on location in France and the United Kingdom; the Louvre allowed the producers to film at the famous museum, but scenes taking place at Westminster Abbey had to filmed elsewhere when church officials declined permission.

2813,The Damned United,"A look at Brian Clough's 44-day reign as the coach of Leeds United.
About controversial soccer manager Brian Clough, set in 1974 but flashing back to the 1960s, about Clough's ill-fated 44-day reign as coach of Leeds United, then one of England's most successful soccer teams.

Taking over England's top football club Leeds United, previously successful manager Brian Clough's abrasive approach and his clear dislike of the players' dirty style of play make it certain there is going to be friction. Glimpses of his earlier career help explain both his hostility to previous manager Don Revie and how much he is missing right-hand man Peter Taylor who has loyally stayed with Brighton & Hove Albion.

The creators of such docudramas as The Queen and Frost/Nixon re-team for this period sports chronicle set in 1974. In England, the Leeds United players retain a status as the preeminent champions of their football league. Unfortunately, the manager to whom the team owes much of its success, visionary Don Revie (Colm Meaney), promptly leaves the unit to take over the England team. His replacement, the slick and confident Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), is publicly known as a vociferous critic of the team's approach to games. Clough has some experience and success to back him up -- in flashbacks, the film details how he and his business partner Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall) coached Derby County from the bottom of the Second Division to the League Championships, though they had much less success working with the Brighton team later on. For various reasons, Taylor refuses to accompany Clough to his new post in Leeds, so Clough must go it alone. Clough wastes no time aggressively attempting to modify the playing style of the team -- he dictates that they play more attractively, and less violently. This clashes with the intentions of the team members, however. When the players hit the field, they find it extraordinarily difficult to adapt to the mandates of their new coach, which sets the stage for a series of losses and puts Clough's reputation on the line.

","After failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him.
The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[2] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2‚Äö√Ñ√¨0.[3] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5‚Äö√Ñ√¨0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them easily, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[4]
Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to secure his position by offering his and Taylor's resignations in a protest against the chairman's unwilligness to fund further signings. To his horror, the club accepts their resignations and bans them from entering the Baseball Ground again (although Clough later sneaks in as a supporter). Derby fans' outrage raises Clough's hopes of being reinstated, and he is backed by the majority of his players as well, but former player Dave Mackay is appointed manager instead. Derby fans quickly lose interest and Clough loses all hope of getting his job back. He and Taylor are then offered jobs at Brighton & Hove Albion. They agree to take the jobs after taking an all-expenses-paid holiday in Majorca. During the holiday that summer, Clough agrees to take control of Leeds after being approached by their representatives.[5] Taylor, however, argues the case for staying at Brighton, and after a bitter quarrel, the two go their separate ways.
Back in the storyline's ""present,"" Clough alienates his players in their first training session, first by telling them that they can throw away any awards they have won because they ""never won any of them fairly,"" and then making them start with a 7-a-side game, which Bremner points out Don Revie never made them do. Clough reminds them that he is not Mr Revie and threatens a severe punishment for any player who mentions the former manager's name or methods again.
The season starts with a Charity Shield match against FA Cup winners Liverpool, which is widely anticipated as both the final match of Liverpool manager Bill Shankly and Clough's debut as Leeds manager. Unfortunately, the event is marred when Leeds's captain, Billy Bremner gets into a fight with Kevin Keegan. Both are sent off, and in turn throw their shirts off and walk off the pitch bare-chested in defiance. Leeds lose the match on penalties, and Bremner is given a two-month suspension from football, forcing Leeds to start the season without their influential captain. As a result, Leeds suffer a horrendous start to the season and are in danger of relegation only one season after winning the title. After Bremner and the players air their grievances to the board, the club terminates Clough's contract - though he forces them to pay an enormous severance package. Afterwards, Clough agrees to do a final interview with Yorkshire Television, but finds Revie there to confront him, bringing the two face to face at last. Clough accuses Revie of being cold-hearted and fundamentally dishonest, both as a person and a football manager, and Revie in turn brands Clough as inflexible and egocentric. Clough brings up the incident in the 1968 FA Cup, and Revie claims to have not known who the rookie manager was at the time (a doubtful claim considering that Revie was known for meticulously researching every opponent his team faced). After the interview, Clough drives down to Brighton to patch things up with Taylor. It involves Clough literally on his knees, grovelling at Taylor's dictation, but they reconcile.
In the film's epilogue, the audience is told that Don Revie failed as England manager, and afterwards never worked in football in his home country again, spending the rest of his career working in the Middle East where he was accused of financial mismanagement. Brian Clough and Peter Taylor meanwhile reunited at Nottingham Forest, where he repeated his prior achievements with Derby by taking them up and winning the First Division, and this time bettered both Revie and his own spell at Derby by winning two European Cups in succession. The film ends by branding Clough ""the best manager that the English national side never had.""","clever,sentimental,sincere,tense",2813.jpg,2009-03-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-damned-united/id311126955?uo=4,PUKKbJdZdSo,,,"Drama,Sports & Fitness"
34,The Darjeeling Limited,"One year after their father's funeral, three brothers travel across India by train in an attempt to bond with one another.
A year after the accidental death of their father, three brothers -- each suffering from depression - meet for a train trip across India. Francis, the eldest, has organized it. The brothers argue, sulk, resent each other, and fight. The youngest, Jack, estranged from his girlfriend, is attracted to one of the train's attendants. Peter has left his pregnant wife at home, and he buys a venomous snake. After a few days, Francis discloses their surprising and disconcerting destination. Amid foreign surroundings, can the brothers sort out their differences? A funeral, a meditation, a hilltop ritual, and the Bengal Lancer figure in the reconciliation.

","A businessman in India (Bill Murray) fails to catch his train as it pulls out of a station. He is beaten to it by a younger man, Peter Whitman (Adrien Brody), who is carrying heavy luggage. Peter reunites with his brothers Francis (Owen Wilson) and Jack (Jason Schwartzman) on the luxury train called ""The Darjeeling Limited"", which is traveling across India. The brothers have not seen each other since their father's funeral.
Francis, the oldest of the three brothers, has planned their journey in advance. The journey is supposed to culminate in a reunion with their mother (Anjelica Huston), but Francis tells his brothers that they are making the journey for spiritual self-discovery. He tells them of a car crash that he was in, saying that he technically died, and wants to reconnect to his brothers. His brothers are not convinced of this, and get annoyed with Francis' controlling behaviour such as choosing from the menu for them, which turns out to be a trait inherited from their mother. With his assistant Brendan's help, Francis draws up an itinerary for the trip and takes his brothers' passports to prevent them from getting off the train too early. The youngest Whitman, Jack, has written a short story which is similar to his own life, but he denies the similarities. He obsessively listens to the messages on his ex-girlfriend's answering machine at every train stop. Moreover, he has a fling with the train's stewardess Rita (Amara Karan), whom Francis nicknames ""Sweet Lime"" for the drinks she offers.
Peter, the middle brother, justifies his keeping many of his late father's possessions by claiming that he was their father's favorite. His wife, Alice (Camilla Rutherford), is expecting a baby, but Peter fears that their relationship may end in divorce.
In their trips through the Indian provinces, Francis has one of his loafers stolen by a shoe-shine boy; Peter buys a cobra, which later escapes from its transport container. This escape results in the brothers being confined to their cabins in the train. Francis and Peter get into a fight over the latter being their father's ""favorite"" and Jack uses pepper spray, trying to stop the fight. The train's Chief Steward (Waris Ahluwalia), whom the three brothers have repeatedly annoyed, throws the three of them off the train with all their luggage. On their way back to civilization, they see three young boys fall into a river while attempting to pull a raft across it. Jack and Francis rescue two of the boys, but Peter fails to save the third, which affects him deeply. In the boys' village, the three brothers are befriended by the villagers and attend the boy's funeral.
In a flashback, the three brothers and Alice are in a car, going to their father's funeral. They stop to pick up their father's Porsche from the repair shop, but the car is not ready so the brothers leave.
Back in the present, the Whitmans get on a bus, which takes them from the village to the airport. However, they rip up their tickets and decide to go visit their mother. The reunion is very emotional (it is learned that Francis's accident was, in fact, a suicide attempt) and the family is reunited for a time. The next morning, the three brothers find that their mother has again left her family and children.
On the way back the three brothers run for a train, and jettison all their baggage on the railway line as they and some porters run after the train. Jack reads his new short story, and gives in, accepting that it is representative of his own life. Francis wants to give the passports back to his brothers, but the brothers decide that the passports are safer with him.","touching,humorous,stylized,clever,bittersweet,offbeat,gloomy",34.jpg,2007-08,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-darjeeling-limited/id274766771?uo=4 ,fY_JQdzoBeM,,,"Action & Adventure,Comedy"

","In Gotham City, The Joker and his accomplices rob a mob-owned bank. The accomplices kill each other off one by one in a sequence masterminded by the Joker, who escapes alone with all the money.
Batman and Lt. Jim Gordon decide to include the new district attorney, Harvey Dent, in their plan to eradicate the mob. Although Dent is dating Rachel Dawes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with his idealism and offers to throw him a fundraiser. Mob bosses Sal Maroni, Gambol, and The Chechen hold a videoconference with Lau, a Chinese accountant who has hidden their funds and fled to Hong Kong. The Joker interrupts the meeting, warning that Batman is unhindered by jurisdiction. He offers to kill Batman for half their money, but the mob bosses refuse, and Gambol puts a bounty on him. The Joker kills Gambol and takes control of his men. Batman captures Lau and delivers him back to Gotham to testify against the Joker and the mob.
The Joker announces that people will die each day unless Batman reveals his identity. He then kills Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb and the judge presiding over the mob trials. He also targets Dent at the fundraiser, but Bruce hides Dent. Gordon foils the Joker's assassination attempt on Mayor Garcia, apparently sacrificing himself in the process. Bruce plans to reveal his identity, but Dent instead names himself as Batman to protect the truth. Dent is taken into protective custody and pursued by the Joker across the city; Batman rushes to Dent's aid. Gordon, who faked his death, helps apprehend the Joker and is promoted to Commissioner.
That night, Dent and Rachel disappear. Batman interrogates the Joker and discovers that Dent and Rachel are held in two separate buildings filled with explosives. The Joker reveals their locations, and Batman goes to Rachel's, only to realize that the Joker has tricked him into finding Dent moments before both buildings explode, killing Rachel and scarring half of Dent's face. The Joker detonates a bomb in the police station and escapes with Lau.
Coleman Reese, an accountant at Wayne Enterprises, deduces Batman's true identity and plans to reveal it. The Joker kills Lau and The Chechen, then threatens to bomb a hospital unless Reese is killed. Gordon and Bruce protect Reese, who changes his mind. The Joker visits Dent in the hospital and convinces him to seek revenge. The Joker then blows up the hospital and escapes with hostages.
Dent starts to go after people responsible for Rachel's death, deciding their fates by flipping a coin. He kills Maroni and a cop who had helped kidnap Rachel. To escalate the chaos, the Joker rigged two ferries with explosives; one ferry is full of citizens, the other full of Arkham Asylum inmates and guards. He then gives the passengers of each ferry the choice to blow the other up before midnight ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ otherwise, both ferries will explode. The passengers ultimately refuse.
Batman asks a reluctant Lucius Fox to use a city-wide tracking prototype device to find the Joker; Fox agrees, but says he will resign immediately afterward. The Joker dresses up hostages as his men, luring Gordon's SWAT team to strike them. Batman fights off the SWAT team and the Joker's men, then rescues the hostages. Batman apprehends the Joker, but the Joker gloats that he has won, as Gotham will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public. The Joker is then taken into custody.
Dent lures Gordon to the building where Rachel died and holds Gordon's family hostage. Batman confronts Dent, who judges the fates of himself, Batman, and Gordon's son with three coin flips. He shoots Batman, spares himself, then flips again to determine the boy's fate. Batman, who is wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building, killing him and saving the boy.[14] Batman then convinces Gordon to frame him for the murders so that Dent will remain a symbol of hope for the city. Gordon destroys the Bat-Signal and launches a manhunt for the Batman. Alfred Pennyworth burns a letter written by Rachel to Bruce announcing her engagement to Dent, and Fox watches the signal tracker self-destruct.","jumping from a rooftop,deck of cards,stylized,criminal mastermind,vigilante,detective,heroism,jujitsu,bleak,tough guy,good versus evil,interrogation,gotham,disguise,martial arts,mass murderer,cards,mass murder,masked vigilante,masked hero,investigation,face paint,clown makeup,playing card,police corruption,action violence,rough,dual identity,exciting,gothic,henchman,clown face,billionaire,love triangle,rocket launcher,action hero,playing cards,secret identity,poison,district attorney,fear,neo noir,mayor,broken leg,dc comics,lamborghini,father figure,criminal,hero,masked superhero,self sacrifice,bat,superhero,scarecrow,warrior,joker,rocket,terrorism,psychological manipulation,clown,gadget,blockbuster,organized crime,evil clown,insanity,conflicted hero,mutilation,tragic hero,trial,laughing,suspenseful,super villain,chaos,kung fu,anti hero,comic hero,mafia boss",2381.jpg,2008-07-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-dark-knight/id290567624?uo=4,GROmJWb-3wU,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
7292,The Dark Knight Rises,"Eight years on, a new evil rises from where the Batman and Commissioner Gordon tried to bury it, causing the Batman to resurface and fight to protect Gotham City... the very city which brands him an enemy.
Despite his tarnished reputation after the events of The Dark Knight, in which he took the rap for Dent's crimes, Batman feels compelled to intervene to assist the city and its police force which is struggling to cope with Bane's plans to destroy the city.

It has been eight years since Batman vanished into the night, turning, in that instant, from hero to fugitive. Assuming the blame for the death of D.A. Harvey Dent, the Dark Knight sacrificed everything for what he and Commissioner Gordon both hoped was the greater good. For a time the lie worked, as criminal activity in Gotham City was crushed under the weight of the anti-crime Dent Act. But everything will change with the arrival of a cunning cat burglar with a mysterious agenda. Far more dangerous, however, is the emergence of Bane, a masked terrorist whose ruthless plans for Gotham drive Bruce out of his self-imposed exile. But even if he dons the cape and cowl again, Batman may be no match for Bane

","Eight years after Harvey Dent's death, the Dent Act grants the Gotham City Police Department powers which nearly eradicate organized crime. Feeling guilty for covering up Dent's crimes, Police Commissioner James Gordon writes a resignation speech confessing the truth, but decides not to use it. Batman has disappeared; Bruce Wayne has become a recluse. Cat burglar Selina Kyle obtains Bruce's fingerprints from his home, kidnaps a congressman, then disappears. Selina hands Bruce's fingerprints to Phillip Stryver, an assistant to Bruce's business rival John Daggett, in hope of having her criminal record erased. Stryver double-crosses Selina, but she uses the congressman's stolen phone to alert the police to their location. Gordon and the police arrive to find the congressman, then pursue Stryver's men into the sewers while Selina flees. A masked man called Bane captures Gordon. Gordon escapes and is found by John Blake, a once-orphaned patrol officer who has deduced Batman's true identity from their similar backgrounds. Gordon promotes Blake to detective, with Blake reporting directly to him.
Wayne Enterprises is unprofitable after Bruce discontinued his fusion reactor project when he learned that the core could be weaponized. Later, Bane attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange, using Bruce's fingerprints in a transaction that bankrupts Wayne. Alfred Pennyworth, concerned that Bruce has not moved on from being Batman, reveals to him that Rachel Dawes had intended to marry Dent before she died, and resigns in an attempt to dissuade him. Fearing that Daggett, Bane's employer, would gain access to the reactor, Bruce asks Wayne Enterprises board member Miranda Tate to take over his company. Bane later kills Daggett. After being promised the software to erase her criminal record, Kyle agrees to take Batman to Bane, but instead leads him into a trap. Bane appears and reveals that he intends to fulfill Ra's al Ghul's mission to destroy Gotham with the League of Shadows remnant. He delivers a crippling blow to Batman's back, then takes him to a foreign, well-like prison where escape is virtually impossible. The inmates tell Bruce the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, born in the prison and cared for by a fellow prisoner before escaping, the only prisoner to have ever done so; Bruce assumes the child to be Bane.
Meanwhile, Bane lures Gotham police underground and collapses the exits. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces an abducted physicist, Dr. Leonid Pavel, to convert the reactor core into a nuclear bomb before killing him. Bane uses the bomb to hold the city hostage and isolate Gotham from the world. Using Gordon's stolen speech, Bane reveals the cover-up of Dent's crimes and releases the prisoners of Blackgate Penitentiary, initiating a revolution. The wealthy and powerful have their property expropriated, are dragged from their homes, and given show trials presided over by Dr. Jonathan Crane, where any sentence means likely death.
After months of recovery and re-training, Bruce escapes from the prison and enlists Kyle, Blake, Tate, Gordon, and Lucius Fox to help stop the bomb's detonation. While the police and Bane's force clash, Batman defeats Bane, but Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself to be Talia al Ghul, Ra's al Ghul's child, who escaped the prison aided by her fellow prisoner, Bane. She plans to complete her father's work by detonating the bomb and destroying Gotham, but Gordon blocks her signal, preventing remote detonation; Talia leaves to find the bomb. Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle kills Bane using the Batpod. Batman pursues Talia with the The Bat, an aircraft developed by Fox, to bring the bomb back to the reactor, where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely destroys the reactor before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses The Bat to haul the bomb over the bay, where it detonates.
In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Bruce also presumed dead, Wayne Manor is left to the city to become an orphanage, and Wayne's remaining estate is left to Alfred. Fox discovers that Bruce had fixed The Bat's autopilot, and Gordon finds the Bat-Signal refurbished. While visiting Florence, Alfred witnesses Bruce and Selina together.

","Matt King (George Clooney) is a Honolulu-based lawyer and the sole trustee of a family trust that controls 25,000 acres of pristine land on the island of Kaua'i. Though he has been able to manage his money, most of Matt's cousins are broke from squandering their share of the inheritance. The trust will expire in seven years because of the rule against perpetuities, so the King family has decided to sell the land to Kaua'i native Don Holitzer for development. Just before family members are ready to formally endorse the deal, a boating accident near Waik∆í¬¥k∆í¬¥ renders Matt's wife, Elizabeth, comatose.
Matt and Elizabeth have two daughters, 10-year-old Scottie (Amara Miller) and 17-year-old Alex (Shailene Woodley). Matt is not very close to his daughters and refers to himself as the ""back-up parent."" With Elizabeth in a coma at Queen's Hospital, he is forced to confront Scottie's inappropriate behavior with other children and Alex's destructive ways.
Matt learns that Elizabeth will never awaken from her coma, which means that under the terms of her living will she must be disconnected shortly from life support. He tells Alex, but not Scottie, that Elizabeth will not recover and must be allowed to die. To Matt's dismay, Alex initially refuses to see her mother. She then reveals to her father that Elizabeth was having an affair at the time of the accident, which caused a major rift between the mother and daughter. Matt confronts two family friends, Kai and Mark. After hearing news of Elizabeth's imminent death, Kai tells Matt that Elizabeth was planning on leaving him for the other man, and learns from Mark that Elizabeth's lover is named Brian Speer (Matthew Lillard).
Matt decides to find Brian and tell him that Elizabeth will soon be dead to give him a chance to visit her while she's still alive. He discovers that Brian is a real estate agent currently vacationing on Kaua'i. After telling the family of Elizabeth's terminal prognosis, Matt, along with the girls and Alex's slacker friend Sid (Nick Krause), travel to Kaua'i to find Brian.
Matt goes jogging on the beach and passes a man that he recognizes as Brian. He trails him and sees him enter a cottage owned by Matt's cousin, Hugh (Beau Bridges). Hugh tells him that Brian is Don Holitzer's brother-in-law, and if Matt and his family sell the land to Holitzer, Brian stands to gain a lot of money from commissions when the land is developed.
Matt goes to the cottage and introduces himself as Elizabeth's husband. He tells Brian that he is there to let him know that Elizabeth will die in a few days and he wants to give Brian a chance to say goodbye. Brian says that while Elizabeth loved him, the affair was only a fling for him, and he loves his wife and family. He tells Matt he is sorry for the pain he caused.
Matt meets with his many cousins to vote on the fate of the family's 25,000 acres. The majority vote is for Don Holitzer, but Matt has second thoughts and decides to keep the land and find a different solution. Shocked, Hugh tells Matt that he and the other cousins may take legal action, but Matt is undeterred.
At Queen's Hospital, Elizabeth is disconnected. Her father Scott (Robert Forster) visits and tells Matt he should have been a more generous and loving husband to Elizabeth, whom he describes as a good and faithful wife. Matt agrees with him, choosing not to disclose the details of Elizabeth's affair to her father. Later, Julie Speer (Judy Greer) arrives, telling Matt she is now aware of the tryst between Elizabeth and her husband. Julie forgives Elizabeth, even though she wants to hate her for destroying her family. Alex and Scottie say their final goodbyes. Finally coming to terms with his wife's act of treachery, Matt tenderly kisses her and tells her goodbye. Later, Matt, Alex, and Scottie scatter Elizabeth's ashes in the ocean off Waikiki.

A young woman who stumbles into the hectic worlds of high fashion and publishing comes to the big screen in this comedy. Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is a bright young woman from the Midwest who has just graduated from college and wants to work as a magazine writer. Andy has applied for a job at ""Runway,"" America's most prestigious fashion journal; though Andy has little to no interest in the garment trade, they are one of the only magazines in New York with a job opening -- second assistant to editor Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep). As Andy quickly learns, Miranda is a diva with plenty of power within the magazine business and she isn't afraid to use it, and though Andy lands the job (primarily by being in the right place at the right time), she soon learns that working for Miranda could test the patience of a saint thanks to her endless demands and refusal to acknowledge the end of a work day. Andy struggles to hold on to the job and her sanity, knowing that a recommendation from Miranda can open nearly any door at any magazine, but can she handle the pressure without losing her mind along the way?

","Andrea ""Andy"" Sachs (Anne Hathaway) is an aspiring journalist fresh out of Northwestern University. Despite ridiculing the shallowness of the fashion industry, she lands the job ""a million girls would kill for"": junior personal assistant to Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), the icy editor-in-chief of Runway fashion magazine. Andy puts up with Miranda's bizarre and humiliating treatment in hopes of getting a job as a reporter or writer somewhere else.
At first, Andy fumbles with her job and fits in poorly with her gossipy, fashion-conscious coworkers, especially Miranda's senior assistant Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt). However, with the help of art director Nigel (Stanley Tucci), she gradually learns her responsibilities and begins to dress more stylishly. She also meets attractive young writer Christian Thompson (Simon Baker), who offers to help her with her career. As she spends increasing amounts of time at Miranda's beck and call, problems arise in her relationships with her college friends and her boyfriend Nate (Adrian Grenier), a chef working his way up the career ladder.
One day, Andy saves Miranda from being embarrassed by Emily at a charity benefit, and Miranda rewards her by offering to take her to the fall fashion shows in Paris instead of Emily. Andy hesitates to take this privilege away from Emily, but she is forced to accept the offer after being told by Miranda that she will lose her job if she declines. Later, Emily is hit by a car and Andy faces the task of having to break the Paris news to her.
When Andrea tells Nate she will be going to Paris, he is angered by her refusal to admit she's become what she once ridiculed, and they break up. Once there, Nigel tells Andy that he has gotten a job as creative director with rising fashion star James Holt (Daniel Sunjata), at Miranda's recommendation. Miranda, without makeup, opens up to Andy about the effect Miranda's impending divorce will have on her daughters. Andy finally succumbs to Christian's charms, and after spending the night with him, Andy learns from him about a plan to replace Miranda with Jacqueline Follet as editor of Runway. Despite the suffering she has endured at her boss's behest, she attempts to warn Miranda.
At a luncheon later that day, however, Miranda announces that it is Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Later, when the two are being driven to a show, she explains to a still-stunned Andy that she was grateful for the warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy she sees some of herself in her. Andy, repulsed, said she could never do to anyone what Miranda did to Nigel, primarily as Nigel mentored Andy. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.
Later, back in New York, she meets Nate for breakfast. He has accepted an offer to work as a sous-chef in a popular Boston restaurant. Andy is disappointed, but her hope is rejuvenated when he says they could work something out. At the film's conclusion, she is interviewing for a newspaper job. The interviewer reveals that Miranda told him she was by far her biggest disappointment, but that he would be an idiot not to hire her. In the last scene, Andy, dressed casually but with a bit more style, sees Miranda getting into her car across the street. They exchange looks and Miranda gives a soft smile once inside the car.","editor,radio city music hall manhattan new york city,female protagonist,devil,dress,cosmo,glamour,new job,vogue, j. k. rowling,fashion industry,eyeliner,anticipation,ambitious woman,vanity fair,fashion model,publisher,new york city,biting,catwalk,coming of age,couture,elle,journalist,fashion,marie claire,joy,magazine,haute couture,witty,paris,times square manhattan new york city,vanity,journalism,handbag,designer,fish out of water,interview,humorous,new york,cosmopolitan,paris france,boston massachusetts,haute couture,job,she devil,magazine editor,fashion,shoes,clever,subway",75.jpg,2006-06-29, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-devil-wears-prada/id288968049?uo=4,hbthtLM5VS4,,,"Comedy,Drama"
2910,The Devil's Double,"A chilling vision of the House of Saddam Hussein comes to life through the eyes of the man who was forced to become the double of Hussein's sadistic son.
Baghdad, the playground for the rich and infamous, where anything can be bought - but for a price. This is Uday Hussein's world and with his depraved lust for debauchery and immorality, he helps himself to whatever turns him on. When army lieutenant Latif Yahia is summoned to Saddam's palace, he is faced with an impossible request - to be Uday's 'fiday' - his body double, or have his family condemned to death. In a world entrenched in betrayal and corruption, knowing who to trust becomes a matter of life or death for Latif, as he battles to escape from his forced existence.

Summoned from the frontline to Saddam Hussein's palace, Iraqi army lieutenant Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper) is thrust into the highest echelons of the ""royal family"" when he's ordered to become the 'fiday' - or body double - to Saddam's son, the notorious ""Black Prince"" Uday Hussein (also Dominic Cooper), a reckless, sadistic party-boy with a rabid hunger for sex and brutality. With his and his family's lives at stake, Latif must surrender his former self forever as he learns to walk, talk and act like Uday. But nothing could have prepared him for the horror of the Black Prince's psychotic, drug-addled life of fast cars, easy women and impulsive violence. -- (C) Lionsgate

Based on a gripping, unbelievable true story of money, power and opulent decadence, the movie takes a white-knuckle ride deep into the lawless playground of excess and violence known as Baghdad, 1987. Summoned from the frontline to Saddam Hussein's palace, Iraqi army lieutenant Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper) is thrust into the highest echelons of the ""royal family"" when he‚Äö√Ñ√¥s ordered to become the body double  to Saddam's son, the notorious ""Black Prince"" Uday Hussein (also Dominic Cooper), a reckless, sadistic party-boy with a rabid hunger for sex and brutality.

","In 1987, Latif Yahia (Dominic Cooper), an Iraqi soldier fighting in the Iran‚Äö√Ñ√¨Iraq War, is called to become a ""fedai"" (""body double"" or political decoy) for Uday Hussein (also played by Cooper), the playboy son of Iraqi president Saddam Hussein (Philip Quast). Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened. Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari and various other exotic cars. Latif tries to resist Uday's exorbitant merrymaking and erratic behavior, at one point fleeing a nightclub in another of Uday's Ferraris to attempt to see his family, who believe he has died in the war. However, he is apprehended by Uday's bodyguards and beaten. After an appearance at a conference with several Kuwaiti leaders, an attempt is made on Uday's (Latif's) life, apparently by a member of a rebel opposition group, possibly a Kurd. The real Uday, though, is more concerned with the Kuwaitis, who he believes have been slant drilling from Iraq's Rumaila oil field. The First Gulf War is launched with Uday proclaiming ""The Age of the Sheikhs is over!""
Uday's increasingly violent, sadistic tendencies are displayed when he kidnaps a 14-year-old school girl and forces her to escort him to a party. At the party, based on an actual 1988 celebration honoring Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's wife Suzanne, Uday becomes enraged with his father's personal bodyguard Kamel Hana Gegeo (Mehmet Ferda). Uday believes Gegeo facilitated an affair between Saddam and Samira Shahbandar, which devastated his mother, Sajida Talfah, and he also expresses jealousy at the trust his father places in Kamel Hana. When Gegeo passes sarcastic comments about Uday's sexual advances towards his young victim, Uday butchers him with an electric carving knife in front of all of the guests. The next morning, Uday's bodyguards are seen dumping the naked, beaten body of the young girl.
Latif, acting as Uday, is later sent to Basra to rally support among Republican Guard soldiers as Coalition forces have taken control of the war. At Basra, another attempt is made on Latif's life. To Uday's great concern, Latif nearly loses a pinky in the assault, which presumably would mean Uday would have to have his amputated to maintain their resemblance, but doctors are able to save Latif's finger. Later, Latif is confronted by the father of the young girl Uday killed. Uday eavesdrops on the conversation and is outraged by the man's pleas for ""justice"" and ""compassion."" Uday orders Latif to kill the man, but Latif refuses and instead slits his own wrists, to Uday's amusement. After Latif recovers, he confronts Uday at his birthday party. The confrontation escalates to a shootout and Latif escapes in Uday's Mercedes with Uday's lover, Sarrab (Ludivine Sagnier). The two escape to Malta, but Sarrab, fearing for her daughter in Iraq, calls Uday begging for the chance to return without being harmed. A would-be assassin sent by Uday just misses shooting Latif almost as soon as they arrive on the island. Uday calls Latif and offers him one final chance to return to Iraq, threatening to kill his father if he refuses. Latif's father encourages him not to return and he is killed.
However, Latif does return to Iraq, not to continue to serve as Uday's double, but rather to kill him, with the help of a man whose bride killed herself after being raped and beaten by Uday on their wedding day. In an adapted version of the attempt on Uday's life made by the 15th Shaaban in 1996, Latif and his partner ambush Uday while he is attempting to lure young girls into his Porsche. They wound him severely, including‚Äö√Ñ√¨consistent with unconfirmed reports of the real-life attack‚Äö√Ñ√¨mangling his genitals with a direct shot. One of Uday's bodyguards catches up to Latif as he flees the scene. The guard, however, is one who Latif could have killed as he fled from Uday's birthday party before leaving the country but spared, and the guard extends him the same courtesy.
The movie ends by stating that Latif has been a very difficult man to find after these events. Uday was permanently handicapped by the attack but survived until his killing by the U.S. forces in 2003.",,2910.jpg,2011-01-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-devils-double/id455958401?uo=4,qhlQOg9abRk,70139562,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Devil_s_Double/70139562,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Oliver Stone's homage to 1960s rock group The Doors also doubles as a biography of the group's late singer, the ""Electric Poet"" Jim Morrison. The movie follows Morrison from his days as a film student in Los Angeles to his death in Paris in 1971, at the age of 27. The movie features a tour-de-force performance by Val Kilmer, who not only looks like Jim Morrison's long-lost twin brother, but also sounds so much like him that he did much of his own singing. It has been written that even the surviving Doors had trouble distinguishing Kilmer's vocals from Morrison's originals.

","Val Kilmer is Jim Morrison in Oliver Stone's hallucinatory bio-pic of the seminal 1960s rock group The Doors. Stone cuts a jagged swath through Morrison's life, starting with a childhood memory where Morrison sees an elderly Indian dying by the roadside. It picks up with Morrison's arrival in California and his assimilation into the Venice Beach culture, followed by his film school days at UCLA; his introduction to his girlfriend Pamela Courson (Meg Ryan); his first encounters with Ray Manzarek (Kyle MacLachlan); and the origin of The Doors -- made up of Manzarek, Robby Kreiger (Frank Whaley), and John Densmore (Kevin Dillon). As the fame of The Doors grows, Morrison's obsession with death increases. The band grows weary of Morrison's missed recording sessions and no-shows at concerts. Morrison, meanwhile, sinks deeper into a drug-induced haze, having mystical sexual encounters with Patricia Kennealy (Kathleen Quinlan), an older rock journalist involved with sadomasochism and witchcraft.

","In northern Iraq, the Reverend Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow), a Roman Catholic priest, is leading an archaeological dig when he discovers a small stone amulet. He discovers that it resembles the statue of Pazuzu, a monstrous creature in the form of a human, bird of prey, scorpion and serpent. Already suffering from a serious, and potentially deadly, heart condition for which he regularly takes nitroglycerin-based medication, Merrin then realises that Pazuzu, whom he had defeated years ago, has returned for revenge‚Äö√Ñ√Æand that their rematch will be a fight to his death.
In Georgetown, Washington, D.C., another priest, named Damien Karras (Jason Miller), apparently loses faith in God after he fails to cure his sick mother who dies in a mental hospital after his uncle John (Titos Vandis) removes her from her apartment in New York City. Elsewhere, movie actress Christine ""Chris"" McNeill (Ellen Burstyn), who is on location in Georgetown, notices that her daughter Regan (Linda Blair) is acting strangely since having played with an ouija board. The symptoms include her using bad language, abnormally high strength, and causing her bed to shake. She is given a few painful tests and x-rays, but they prove negative. Unbeknownst to both Chris and Dr. Klein(Barton Heyman), Regan is now possessed by Pazuzu, whom Regan had called ""Captain Howdy.""
Burke Dennings (Jack McGowran), the director of Chris's film Crash Course, whom she has a crush on, is killed by Regan, and his death is investigated by Detective Lieutenant William F. Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb). He quizzes both Karras and Chris before telling the latter he will see Regan once she is well. Following Klein's advice, Chris gets Karras to see Regan, whose face is now replaced by Pazuzu's.
At first Karras refuses to help, but after hearing the demon's voice talking in reverse and ""Help Me"" in Regan's writing, he decides to perform the exorcism, with Merrin's assistance. Both men try to exorcise the demon but to no avail in the first attempt. After taking a break, Karras is told to leave Regan's room by Merrin after he is unfit to continue. Karras returns, though, and finds Merrin dead. He then wrestles Pazuzu, defying the demon to leave Regan and take him over. The demon possesses him, and tries to destroy Regan again, but Karras, recovering himself long enough to prevent this, instead kills himself by jumping out the window (similar to Dennings's death) and Chris and Regan are reunited.
Days later Chris and Regan leave Washington to return home to Los Angeles, saying goodbye en route to Father Dyer (William O'Malley), an old friend of Karras. (Regan appears to have no memory of either her ordeal or any of the various evil experiences to which it subjected her.) Kinderman returns to the house, but upon learning that the MacNeils have left he then decides to question Dyer as he investigates the deaths of Merrin and Karras.","scary,less...,bleak,more...,suspenseful,tense,stylized,sexual,rough,horror,atmospheric,captivating",3462.jpg,1973-12-26, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-exorcist/id272311369?uo=4,Tlu2w9lX2CA,,,"Classics,Horror"

","Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) is an American welterweight boxer from Lowell, Massachusetts. Managed by his mother, Alice Ward (Melissa Leo), and trained by his older half-brother, Dicky Eklund (Christian Bale), Micky has not had a particularly successful career: He's become a ""stepping stone"" for other boxers to defeat on their way up. Complicating matters, Dicky, a former boxer whose peak of success was knocking Sugar Ray Leonard down in an HBO televised match, has fallen apart since then, becoming addicted to crack cocaine. He is now being filmed for an HBO documentary he believes to be about his ""comeback"".
On the night of an undercard fight in Atlantic City, Micky's scheduled opponent is ill, and a substitute is found who is 20 pounds heavier than Micky. Despite Micky's reservations, his mother and brother agree to the terms so that they can all get the purse. Micky is soundly defeated by the much heavier fighter in an obvious mismatch. Frustrated with his career and embarrassed by his defeat, Micky tries to retreat from the world and forms a relationship with Charlene Fleming (Amy Adams), a former college athlete who dropped out and became a bartender.
After several weeks, Alice arranges another fight for Micky, who, concerned it will turn out the same as before, shows serious hesitation. His mother and seven sisters blame Charlene for his lack of motivation. Micky mentions that he's received an offer to be paid to train in Las Vegas, but Dicky says he will match the offer so he can keep training and working with his family. Dicky then tries to get money by posing his girlfriend as a prostitute and then, once she picks up a client, impersonating a police officer to steal the client's money. This is quickly foiled by the actual police and Dicky is arrested after a chase and a fight with them. Micky intervenes to try to stop the police from beating his brother, and a police officer breaks his hand before arresting him. At their arraignment, Micky is released but Dicky is sent to jail. Finally fed up, Micky washes his hands of Dicky.
On the night of the HBO documentary's airing, Dicky's family, and Dicky himself in prison, are horrified to see it is called High on Crack Street: Lost Lives in Lowell and about how crack addiction ruined Dicky's career and life. Devastated, Dicky begins training and trying to get his life together in prison. Micky is lured back into boxing by his father, who believes Alice and his stepson Dicky are bad influences. The other members of his training team and a new manager, Sal Lanano, convince Micky to return to boxing with the explicit understanding that his mother and brother will no longer be involved. They place Micky in minor fights to help him regain his confidence. He is then offered another major fight against an undefeated up-and-coming boxer. During a prison visit, Dicky advises Micky on how best to work his opponent, but Micky feels his brother is being selfish and trying to restart his own failed career. During the actual match, Micky is nearly overwhelmed at the beginning but then implements his brother's advice and is eventually triumphant; he earns the title shot for which his opponent was being groomed.
Upon his release from prison, Dicky and his mother go to see Micky train. Assuming things are as they were, Dicky prepares to spar with his brother, but Micky informs him that he's no longer allowed per Micky's agreement with his current team. In the ensuing argument, in which Micky chastises both factions of his family, Charlene and his trainer leave in disgust. Micky and Dicky spar until Micky knocks Dicky down. Dicky storms off, presumably to get high again, and Alice chides Micky, only to be sobered when he tells her that she has always favored Dicky. Dicky returns to his crack house, where he says goodbye to his friends and heads to Charlene's apartment. He tells her that Micky needs both of them and they need to work together. After bringing everyone back together, the group goes to London for the title fight. Micky scores another upset victory and the welterweight title. The film jumps a few years ahead, with Dicky, as talkative as ever, crediting his brother as the creator of his own success.","shadow boxing,jab,punched in the face,domineering mother,blue collar worker,winner,documentary filmmaking,loyalty,new hampshire,boxing,loser,crack house,based on true story,boxing trainer,manipulation,hook,1990s,punch,gym,drug addiction,underdog,catfight,ex boxer,cambodian,boxing match,boxing ring,anger,black eye,beating,home movie,redemption,criminal,lowell massachusetts,thinness,press conference,jumping rope,boxer shorts,broken hand,skipping,shame,bandaged hand,training,second chance,better man,interview,drug addict,boxer,boxing gloves,drug withdrawal,pary,documentary crew,drug use",7315.jpg,2011-02-04,,71l-kIhJ5j8,,,"Sports & Fitness,Drama"

A documentary about the punk band The Sex Pistols. The film tries to lit some of the backgrounds of their way through the punk era while telling the story of the band from zero back to zero. Features lots of interviews and comments of folks who were involved.

Although their career lasted a bit less than two years, few rock bands have made a more dramatic impact than the Sex Pistols, who quickly rose to international infamy as the best-known British punk band, then fell apart shortly after their first American tour in a tempest of drugs, ego, and infighting. Manager Malcolm McLaren began making a film about the group while they were at the height of their fame, but by the time McLaren and director Julien Temple completed The Great Rock 'n' Roll Swindle, the group's best-known member, bassist Sid Vicious, was dead, and the remaining Pistols -- vocalist Johnny Rotten (aka John Lydon), guitarist Steve Jones, drummer Paul Cook, and original bassist Glen Matlock were in litigation against McLaren and refused to participate. In 1998, Temple began working with the group's surviving members (who reunited for a brief tour in 1996) for this definitive documentary of the Pistols' career, which combines new interviews with footage of legendary live performances (such as their infamous Jubilee Day show on a ship sailing past the Houses of Parliament), as well as newsreels of the chaos that followed in their wake, including the TV appearance that changed them overnight from a little-known cult band to national pariahs.

When Jason regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in ancient China that is under attack by armored soldiers. The soldiers see his staff and attempt to seize it. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar Lu Yan (Jackie Chan), a supposed ""immortal,"" who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu brings Jason to a teahouse and tells him the story of the rivalry between the Monkey King and the Jade Warlord. The Jade Warlord tricked the Monkey King into setting aside his magic staff Ruyi Jingu Bang and transformed him into a stone statue, but the Monkey King cast his staff far away before the transformation. Being an immortal, the Monkey King did not die, but got captured inside the statue. Lu ends the tale with a prophecy about someone, a ""Seeker"", who will find the staff and free the Monkey King. Just then, they are attacked by the Jade Warlord's men again but manage to escape with the help of Golden Sparrow, a young girl who refers to herself in the third person. She reveals that her family was murdered by the Jade Warlord, against whom she has therefore sworn revenge.
Meanwhile, the Jade Warlord (Collin Chou), upon learning that the staff has been sighted, sends the White-Haired Witch Ni-Chang to help him retrieve it in exchange for the elixir of immortality. Jason, Lu Yan and Golden Sparrow meet a strange man dressed in white, also played by Jet Li, who takes the staff away from them. Lu Yan fights with the man (later revealed to be the Silent Monk) for the staff until the latter realizes that Jason is the prophesied Seeker, and he joins them in their quest to free the Monkey King. As the four travel to Five Elements Mountain, Lu Yan and the Silent Monk teach Jason Kungfu along the way. After crossing a desert, they encounter Ni-Chang and her henchmen and a battle ensues, in which Lu Yan is mortally wounded by Ni-Chang's arrow. The protagonists take refuge in a monastery, where they learn that Lu is actually not an immortal as he failed the test to become one. Only the Jade Warlord's elixir can save his life. In desperation, Jason goes to the Warlord's palace alone to exchange the staff for the elixir.
In the palace, the Jade Warlord asks Jason to fight with Ni-Chang to the death, because he had promised to give the elixir to only one of them. Jason is defeated by Ni-Chang and the Warlord taunts him for his foolishness, and is about to decapitate him when the other protagonists and monks from the monastery arrive to join in the battle. Jason manages to grab the elixir and he tosses it to Lu Yan, who drinks it and recovers. The Silent Monk is wounded by the Jade Warlord's Guan Dao during the fight and he passes the staff to Jason, who uses it to smash the Monkey King's statue. The Monkey King is freed and the Silent Monk is revealed to be actually one of the Monkey's clones. Lu Yan battles Ni-Chang and kills her by throwing her off the cliff hundreds of feet below. After another long battle between the Monkey King and the Jade Warlord, the Warlord is eventually stabbed by Jason and falls into a lava pit to his death. However, Golden Sparrow has been seriously injured by the Warlord and she dies in Jason's arms, thanking him in the first person before dying. By then, the Jade Emperor has returned from his meditation and he praises Jason for fulfilling the prophecy and allows him for one wish, which he asked is to return home.
Jason finds himself back in 21st century Boston after passing through a magical portal at the exact moment and location of his earlier fall. He defeats Lupo easily by using the Kungfu moves he was taught and drives the other hooligans away. He alerts the police and calls an ambulance for Hop, who survives from the gunshot wound and brushes off Jason's concerns, claiming that he is immortal. (hinting that he is actually Lu Yan; a fact which also would have been hinted by the name of the pawn shop as seen in the beginning: ""Lu Yan's Pawn Shop""). Before the film ends, Jason is delighted to see a girl who resembles Golden Sparrow and speaks to her briefly, before she heads back to her shop, called ""Golden Sparrow Chinese Merchandise"". The final scene shows Jason on a rooftop at night practicing his staffwork and continuing to hone his kung fu skills.","exciting,stylized",392.jpg,2008-04-04, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-forbidden-kingdom/id281889636?uo=4,6t8_jG56mEo,,,Action & Adventure
3028,The French Connection,"A pair of NYC cops in the Narcotics Bureau stumble onto a drug smuggling job with a French connection.
William Friedkin's gritty police drama portrays two tough New York City cops trying to intercept a huge heroin shipment coming from France. An interesting contrast is established between 'Popeye' Doyle, a short-tempered alcoholic bigot who is nevertheless a hard-working and dedicated police officer, and his nemesis Alain Charnier, a suave and urbane gentleman who is nevertheless a criminal and one of the largest drug suppliers of pure heroin to North America. During the surveillance and eventual bust, Friedkin provides one of the most gripping and memorable car chase sequences ever filmed.

The French Connection is William Friedkin's gritty, Oscar winning police drama where two tough New York City cops try to intercept a huge heroin shipment coming from France. Police partners Popeye Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy Russo (Roy Scheider) put a candy store under surveillance based on a hunch that something fishy was going on. Eventually it turns out that the proprietors are involved in one of the biggest narcotics smuggling rings on either side of the Atlantic, and the cops go to work. Popeye Doyle is a short-tempered alcoholic bigot, but he is nevertheless a hard-working and dedicated police officer. Doyle's nemesis is Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a suave and urbane gentleman who is a criminal, and one of the largest suppliers of pure heroin to North America. As money troubles begin for the hoods they decide to kill Popeye and Buddy to give them enough room to bring in the heroin.

","The film revolves around the smuggling of narcotics between Marseilles, France and New York City. In Marseilles a policeman is staking out Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a French criminal who is smuggling heroin from France to the United States. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's henchman, Pierre Nicoli (Marcel Bozzuffi).
In New York, detectives James ""Popeye"" Doyle (Gene Hackman) and Buddy ""Cloudy"" Russo (Roy Scheider) are conducting an undercover stakeout in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. After seeing a drug transaction take place in a bar, Russo goes in to make an arrest and the suspect makes a break for it. After catching up with their suspect and delivering a severe beating after the suspect cuts Russo on the arm with a knife, the detectives aggressively interrogate the man, forcing him to reveal where his connection is based.
After Russo's injury is treated, Doyle convinces him to go out for a drink. At the Copacabana, Doyle becomes interested in Salvatore ""Sal"" Boca (Tony Lo Bianco) and his young wife, Angie (Arlene Farber), who are entertaining Mob members involved in narcotics. Doyle persuades his partner to tail the couple; although the Bocas run a modest newsstand luncheonette, they have criminal records: Sal is said to have held up Tiffany and also killed ""a guy named DeMarco"" while Angie drew a suspended sentence for shoplifting and Sal's brother Lou served jail time for assault and robbery. They make nearly nightly trips to several nightclubs, as well as drive several new cars, which indicate they may be involved in criminal activity. A link is established between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock (Harold Gray), who is rumored to have connections in the narcotics underworld; Doyle and Russo allude to a drug shipment from Mexico bankrolled by Weinstock.
Doyle and Russo roust a bar in their precinct, where the majority of the black patrons are in possession of marijuana and other minor drugs. The rousting is a stunt for Doyle to connect with an informant, whom he questions about an apparent shortage of hard drugs on the street; Doyle is told that a major shipment of heroin is on its way. The detectives convince their supervisor, Walt Simonson (Eddie Egan), to wiretap the Bocas' phones and use several ruses to try to obtain more information.
The film centers on three main points: the criminals' efforts to smuggle drugs into the United States, which is made easier when Charnier dupes his friend, a French actor named Henri Devereaux (Fr‚àö¬©d‚àö¬©ric de Pasquale), into importing an automobile (unbeknownst to Devereaux, the drugs are concealed within the vehicle) and the sale of the drugs to Weinstock and Sal Boca; the efforts of Doyle and Russo to shadow Boca and Charnier; and the conflicts the detectives have with Simonson and a federal agent named Mulderig (Bill Hickman), assigned to the case due to the wiretap. Doyle and Mulderig dislike each other; Russo and Doyle feel they can handle the bust without the government's help, and Mulderig criticizes Doyle on items ranging from trivialities like Doyle's appearance to an incident where a policeman was killed and Mulderig holds Doyle responsible. Doyle comes to blows with Mulderig.
Weinstock's chemist (Pat McDermott) tests a sample of the heroin and declares it the purest he has ever seen, establishing that the shipment could make as much as $32 million on a half-million dollar investment. Boca is impatient to make the purchase (reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible), while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.
Charnier soon ""makes"" Doyle and realizes he has been observed since his arrival in New York. Nicoli offers to kill Doyle; Charnier objects, knowing killing one policeman will not amount to anything, but Nicoli says they will be in France before they can be detained. Nicoli attempts to assassinate Doyle, but botches the job, leading to a car chase scene that culminates with Nicoli's hijacking an elevated train.
Nicoli, after killing a policeman who was pursuing him, holds the driver at gunpoint. Near the end of the line Nicoli is confronted by passengers and the motorman passes out. The train reaches the end of the line and is halted by a safety mechanism on the tracks. Nicoli escapes the train and Doyle shoots him when he attempts to escape. The car containing the drugs is impounded when some thieves try to strip it of its valuables. Doyle and Russo take the car apart searching for drugs. When Russo notes the vehicle is 120 pounds over its listed weight, they realize the drugs must still be in the car. The mechanic tells them he did not remove the car's rocker panels; when he does, the drugs are discovered. The police later return the car to Devereaux, seemingly untouched.
It seems as though the drug deal has been a major success; Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Using a car that Sal Boca's brother Lou (Benny Marino) picked out, the criminals conceal the money. The car is to be imported into France, where Charnier will retrieve the money. Charnier and Sal Boca drive off, but run into a roadblock consisting of a large force of police led by Doyle. The police chase Charnier and Sal Boca to an old factory. Sal is killed during a shootout with the police and almost all of the others surrender.
Charnier escapes into the warehouse and Doyle hunts for him. Russo joins in the search. Doyle, trigger-happy and high on adrenaline, sees a shadowy figure in the distance and empties his revolver at it a split-second after shouting a warning. The man Doyle kills is not Charnier, but Mulderig. Doyle seems unfazed and vows to capture Charnier, reloading his gun and running into another room. The last sound heard in the film is a single gunshot. (In the TV version that ran in the late 1970s, Doyle says of getting Charnier, I'm going to get that son of a bitch if it takes me the rest of my life!!)
Title cards before the closing credits note that Joel Weinstock and Angie Boca got away without prison time while Lou Boca got a reduced sentence and Devereaux served four years. Charnier was never caught. Both Doyle and Russo were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.","exciting,bleak,suspenseful,tense,clever,rough,atmospheric,captivating",3028.jpg,1971-10-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-french-connection/id403440312?uo=4,3400,,,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Drama"
1628,The Front Line,"A drama centered on the Korean War's final battle that will determine the border between north and south.

Toward the end of the Korean War, an uneasy ceasefire is ordered, but out on the Eastern front line of the Aerok Hills, in an expanse of land called the Aero.K, fierce fighting continues. A race to capture this strategic point to determine a new border between the two Koreas is the ultimate prize. At the Eastern border stands the ""Alligator Company,"" known to be the best soliders on the front line. They are the only unit to have survived the worst battle of the war at Pohang. When a South Korean bullet is found in the dead body of a company commander, Lieutenant of Defense Security Command Kang Eun-Pyo (Shin Ha-Kyun) is ordered to investigate Alligator Company for the murder. Upon arrival, Kang Eun-Pyo is immediately shocked at the state of the soldiers, the conditions on the front, and the presence of Kim Soo-Hyuk, a former friend he believed to be dead. With a truce promised for years but no end in sight, one man struggles to make sense of a crime in the face of countless lives sacrificed for war.

","Early in the Korean War, as the North is rolling through South Korea, Eun-pyo and Soo-hyeok are captured during a battle and brought to North Korean captain Jung-yoon. Jung-yoon declaims to the prisoners that the war will be over in a week and that he knows exactly why they are fighting this devastating war, brother against brother. Afterwards he lets the prisoners go free, so that they can help reconstruct the nation after the war.
Two years later, despite ceasefire negotiations, the fighting continues around the Aerok Hills on the eastern front, as that would help determine the future dividing line between the North and the South. The hills continue to change hands, so that even the ceasefire negotiators don't always know who controls them.
Amidst the fighting, the South Korean officer commanding Alligator Company, who are fighting for Aerok Hill, is found dead by a Southern bullet. First Lieutenant Kang Eun-pyo of the Defense Security Command is sent to investigate the murder and also an apparent mole who had mailed a letter from a Northern soldier to his family in the South.
Eun-pyo arrives at the front lines accompanied with Captain Jae-oh, the new commanding officer of Alligator Company, and a raw recruit. Eun-pyo's perceptions change quickly upon arriving at the eastern front. The acting commander, Captain Young-il, is addicted to morphine, some of the men are wearing Northern uniforms to keep warm and refer to their fallen friends as ""comrades"", war orphans live among the soldiers, and Eun-pyo's old friend Kim Soo-hyeok is not only alive but has moved up in rank. He has also transformed from a scared and useless soldier to a ruthless killer and tactician. Also, the entire unit seems to be attempting to suppress their memories about something unspoken that happened in Pohang, earlier in the war.
It turns out that Jeong-yoon is commanding the North Korean forces against them, and after the North has again retaken the hill, the South take it back and Eun-pyo joins them in battle. When the fighting is finished he sees that the new recruit is drunk. As alcohol was not distributed to troops, his suspicion leads him to discover Soo-hyeok, Young-il, and a few other soldiers enjoying the contents of a secret communication box buried within the hills in a cave that acts as a mail system and gift exchange from one side to the other. It had originally been used to trade insults between the sides, but evolved into exchanging letters and presents. The North would leave rice wine, and the South would leave American made cigarettes and chocolate.
Winter turns to summer and the land continues to change sides. Secrets are held not only by Soo-hyeok but among the seasoned fighters on both sides. Near the end of the war, Chinese troops are deployed in human wave tactics to attack the hill, and the North Koreans are positioned to cut off the retreat route of the South Koreans. During the battle, Jae-oh errs by committing his men to the front line despite the pleas of his lieutenants to fall back to a more defensible position. Eventually, the hill is overrun, and Jae-oh is murdered by Soo-hyeok after refusing to retreat. Soo-hyeok in turn is killed by a North Korean sniper nicknamed 'Two Seconds'.
After the battle, news of an armistice agreement reaches both sides, and celebrations start. A group of North and South Korean soldiers encounter each other washing up in a mountain valley stream, but after a tense early moment, send each other off with goodbyes. However, the armistice is not yet in effect for another 12 hours. Both sides are told by their superiors to fight for the most strategically important pieces of land. As a result, there is a final climactic battle in which Eun-pyo kills 'Two Seconds', who turns out to be a woman. Captain Young-il's arm and leg are blown off by an explosion and then is shot and killed by Jung-yoon. Eventually, everyone on both sides is killed except for the North Korean commander Jung-yoon and Eun-pyo.
Eun-pyo finds Jung-yoon in the cave with the gift box. He asks him why exactly they are fighting. Jung-yoon replies that he knew once, but has now forgotten. They share a smoke, and Jung-yoon dies shortly after.
The movie ends with a shot of Eun-pyo walking down the hill among the corpses of all the fallen soldiers, leaving the fate of Aerok Hill unknown.",,1628.jpg, ,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-front-line/id521436560?uo=4 ,,,,Drama

","Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford), a surgeon in Chicago, arrives home one night to find his wife, Helen (Ward), fatally wounded by a one-armed man. Although Kimble makes an effort to subdue the killer, the man escapes. The lack of evidence of a break-in, his being the beneficiary of Helen's lucrative life insurance, and a misunderstood 9-1-1 call, result in his conviction of first degree murder in a court of law. On his way to death row aboard a bus, his fellow prisoners attempt an escape. The pandemonium results in a wounded guard and a dead driver, causing the bus to fall down a ravine and into the path of an oncoming train. Kimble escapes the destructive collision and flees the scene. Deputy U.S. Marshal Samuel Gerard (Jones), and his colleagues Renfro (Pantoliano), Biggs (Roebuck), Newman (Wood) and Poole (Caldwell), arrive at the crash site and formulate a search plan to apprehend the escaped convicts. Kimble sneaks into a hospital to treat his wounds and change his appearance; he later makes a getaway in an ambulance.


Chicago, Illinois, where the provincial story took place.
Kimble returns to Chicago to hunt for the murderer and secretly acquires some money from his friend and associate, Dr. Charles Nichols (Krabb‚àö¬©). Posing as a janitor, Kimble enters Cook County Hospital's prosthetic department to obtain a list of people who had their prosthetic arm repaired shortly after his wife's murder. Gerard realizes that Kimble must be looking for the one-armed man. He begins a similar search to anticipate Kimble's next move. Later, Kimble breaks into the residence of a former police officer named Frederick Sykes (Katsulas), confirming that the man is the murderer and discovering that he is employed by a pharmaceutical company which is working on a new drug called Provasic. Kimble had investigated the drug in the past and revealed that it caused liver damage, which in turn would have prevented it from being approved by the FDA. He also deduces that Nichols, who is leading the drug's development, arranged a cover-up, and ordered Sykes to kill him; his wife's death was incidental. Gerard follows Kimble's lead to Sykes' home and draws the same conclusion.
As Kimble takes an elevated train to confront Nichols at the drug's presentation in a hotel, Sykes appears and attacks him. In the ensuing struggle, Sykes shoots a transit cop before being subdued and handcuffed to a pole by Kimble. Kimble arrives at the pharmacon conference and interrupts Nichols's speech, accusing him of falsifying his medical research and orchestrating his wife's consequent murder. They begin to fight while being chased by the marshals and police. During the related confrontation, Kimble, Nichols, Renfro and Gerard find themselves in the hotel's laundry room. Gerard calls out that he's aware of the conspiracy fabricated by Nichols. Hearing that, Nichols injures Renfro and confiscates his gun. Nichols then attempts to shoot Gerard, but Kimble attacks him from behind, rendering him unconscious. Kimble is later exonerated and driven away from the crime scene by Gerard.","rough,exciting,suspenseful",3514.jpg,1993-08-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-fugitive/id282551004?uo=4,GoyqZJWjOjU,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

Stars:
 William Atherton, Blythe Auffarth, Blanche Baker","Set in 1958, the film follows the story of two adolescent girls, Meg (Blythe Auffarth) and Susan (Madeline Taylor) who, upon losing their parents in an accident, are sent to live with their Aunt Ruth Chandler (Blanche Baker), a sadistic psychopath, and their three cousins, Willie (Graham Patrick Martin), Ralphie (Austin Williams) and Donny (Benjamin Ross Kaplan).
David, a young boy living in 1950's Indiana, is neighbor to the Chandlers. When Meg arrives, he is instantly infatuated, attracted by her innocence. Aunt Ruth allows the children of the neighborhood to travel freely in and out of her house, offering them beer and cigarettes. Meg quickly becomes a target to Ruth, who belittles her, making suggestions that she is a whore, and starves her. One day David arrives at the house to find Meg's cousins tickling her. She knocks Ralphie to the floor, wanting him to back off, and runs from the room. Ruth punishes Susan for Meg's actions, as Meg's cousins hold her back. Ruth then takes the ring that Meg wears around her neck, which belonged to her mother.
A few days later, Meg stops a policeman and tells him what happened. As punishment, Ruth, her children and their friends tie Meg in the cellar with her hands over her head. They play a bizarre game of ""confession,"" and when Meg has nothing to confess, she is stripped naked. They gag her and leave her there. That night, the boys sneak back downstairs, giving her water. They agree to loosen her bindings, but only if she lets them touch her. She refuses, but David loosens them anyway.
A while later, Meg is untied but refuses to eat, claiming that her mouth is too dry from dehydration to swallow it without choking. Ruth again punishes Susan for Meg's disobedience. The kids of the town treat her like a play thing, beating, cutting and burning her. David tries to tell his parents, but can't. Police Officer Jennings (Kevin Chamberlin) eventually arrives at the house, having had their suspicions raised after a local boy talked to them. However, they leave finding nothing. David decides that it is time for Meg to escape, and unties her, promising her he will leave her money in the forest for her to run away with.
The next day, David descends into the cellar to find Meg tied to the bed, being raped by Willie. David tries to leave but Donny stops him. Donny steps forward, wanting to rape Meg as well, but Ruth does not want him to, considering it to be incest to have sex with her so soon after his brother. Ruth instead offers Eddie or David to take a turn with her. When David declines, Ruth heats a needle and carves a message on Meg's stomach, telling her that now she will never be able to be with a man. Ruth then decides that they should make Meg 'perfect' by giving her a clitorectomy, thus ""destroying her desire for men forever."" At this, David runs for the door, planning to escape and tell somebody. Several of the boys chase him, stopping him on the stairs. As one holds a knife to his neck, Ruth tells the boys to tie him up and says they'll ""do something about him later"" and one of the boys kicks him in the groin before turning their attention back to Meg. Bound on the floor, he can only watch helplessly as Meg is mutilated with a blowtorch.
The next morning David awakes still on the cellar floor. He frees himself from his bindings, and finds Susan sitting with an unconscious Meg. Susan tells David that Meg did not escape the night that he untied her because she was caught trying to take Susan with her. Although David's plan was to come back for Susan after Meg escaped, Susan had told Meg that Ruth has been touching her on a regular basis to the extent of making her bleed, so Meg didn't want to leave her behind. Susan then tearfully insists that Meg should have just gone without her and saved herself while she could, but David tells Susan everything was going to be alright.
David is afraid that Meg won't survive much longer without help, so he lights a fire in the cellar. As the smoke rises, Ruth enters the room and is beaten to death by David with Susan's crutch. Jennings arrives, taking Susan from the room and going for help. David retrieves Meg's mother's ring from Ruth, and gives it to her before she finally dies, her body finally succumbing to its wounds.
As an adult, David reflects on how his past still haunts him to his present day, though as Meg taught him, ""It's what you do last that really counts.""",,3476.jpg,2007-10-03, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-girl-next-door/id374228442?uo=4,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=typY725pjZ4,,,"Drama,Horror"

Blomkvist's daughter visits him and notes that the numbers from the notebook are Bible references. Blomkvist tells Vanger's lawyer Dirch Frode (Steven Berkoff) that he needs help with his research, and Frode recommends Salander based on the work she did researching Blomkvist himself. Blomkvist hires Salander to further investigate the notebook's content. She uncovers a connection to a series of murders of young women that occurred from 1947 through 1967, with the women either being Jewish or having Biblical names; many of the Vangers are known antisemites. During the investigation, Salander and Blomkvist become lovers. Henrik's brother Harald (Per Myrberg) identifies Martin (Stellan Skarsg‚àö‚Ä¢rd), Harriet's brother and operational head of the Vanger empire, as a possible suspect. Salander's research uncovers evidence that Martin and his deceased father, Gottfried, had committed the murders.
Blomkvist breaks into Martin's house to look for more clues, but Martin catches him and prepares to kill him. Martin brags about having killed women for decades, but denies killing Harriet. Salander arrives, subdues Martin and saves Blomkvist. While Salander tends to Blomkvist, Martin flees. Salander, on her motorcycle, pursues Martin in his SUV. He loses control of his vehicle on an icy road and dies when it catches fire. Salander nurses Blomkvist back to health, and tells him that she tried to kill her father when she was 12. After recovering, Blomkvist deduces that Harriet is still alive and her cousin Anita (Joely Richardson) likely knows where she is. He and Salander monitor Anita, waiting for her to contact Harriet. When nothing happens, Blomkvist confronts her, correctly deducing that Anita is Harriet herself. She explains that her father and brother had sexually abused her for years, and that Martin saw her kill their father in self-defense. Her cousin Anita smuggled her out of the island and let her live under her identity. Finally free of her brother, she returns to Sweden and tearfully reunites with Henrik.
As promised, Henrik gives Blomkvist the information on Wennerstr‚àö‚àÇm, but it proves to be worthless. Salander hacks into Wennerstr‚àö‚àÇm's computer and presents Blomkvist with damning evidence of Wennerstr‚àö‚àÇm's crimes. Blomkvist publishes an article which ruins Wennerstr‚àö‚àÇm, who flees the country. Salander hacks into Wennerstr‚àö‚àÇm's bank accounts and, travelling to Switzerland in disguise, transfers two billion euros to various accounts. Wennerstr‚àö‚àÇm is soon found murdered. Salander reveals to her former guardian that she is in love with Blomkvist. On her way to give Blomkvist a Christmas present, however, Salander sees him and his longtime lover and business partner Erika Berger (Robin Wright) walking together happily. Dismayed, she discards the gift and rides away.",,7298.jpg,2011-12-26,,1KBPru-Pu5Q,,,Horror
3139,The God Who Wasn't There,This provocative documentary explores the case that Jesus Christ never existed.,"Jesus myth hypothesis
Most of the film is a presentation of the argument for the Jesus myth hypothesis. Flemming and those he interviews in the film make these claims:
The history of Christianity, especially the doctrine of the earliest Christians, is consistent with Jesus having been a mythical character, with historical details only added on later.
The Epistles of Paul, which were written before the Gospels, show no awareness on the part of the author that Jesus was supposed to have been a human being who recently lived. Paul mentions only the crucifixion, the resurrection and the ascension and presents them as having occurred in a mythic realm rather than an earthly one.
The death-resurrection-ascension sequence was common in previous mythologies and religions, making it more likely that the Jesus character was inspired by his similar forebears than that he actually lived on Earth.
Other details of the Jesus biography offered in the Gospels also have precedent in previous mythologies and religions, especially Judaism. For example, the ""Massacre of the Innocents"" scene appears to be directly inspired by a nearly identical story in Exodus.",,3139.jpg,2005-05-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-god-who-wasnt-there/id472462690?uo=4,,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"
558,The Good Shepherd,"Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie and Robert De Niro star in this powerful thriller about the birth of the CIA. Edward Wilson (Damon) believes in America, and will sacrifice everything he loves to protect it. But as one of the covert founders of the CIA, Edward's youthful idealism is slowly eroded by his growing suspicion of the people around him. Everybody has secrets... but will Edward's destroy him? With an all-star cast including Alec Baldwin, Billy Crudup, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton and John Turturro, it's the gripping story David Ansen of Newsweek hails as ""spellbinding.""","The tumultuous early history of the Central Intelligence Agency is viewed through the prism of one man's life.
Laconic and self-contained, Edward Wilson heads CIA covert operations during the Bay of Pigs. The agency suspects that Castro was tipped, so Wilson looks for the leak. As he investigates, he recalls, in a series of flashbacks, his father's death, student days at Yale (poetry; Skull and Bones), recruitment into the fledgling OSS, truncated affairs, a shotgun marriage, cutting his teeth on spy craft in London, distance from his son, the emergence of the Cold War, and relationships with agency, British, and Soviet counterparts. We watch his idealism give way to something else: disclosing the nature of that something else is at the heart of the film's narration as he closes in on the leak.

3541,The Goonies,"A group of kids embark on a wild adventure after finding a pirate treasure map.
Mikey Walsh and Brandon Walsh are brothers whose family is preparing to move because developers want to build a golf course in the place of their neighborhood -- unless enough money is raised to stop the construction of the golf course, and that's quite doubtful. But when Mikey stumbles upon a treasure map of the famed ""One-Eyed"" Willy's hidden fortune, Mikey, Brandon, and their friends Lawrence ""Chunk"" Cohen, Clark ""Mouth"" Devereaux, Andrea ""Andy"" Carmichael, Stefanie ""Stef"" Steinbrenner, and Richard ""Data"" Wang, calling themselves The Goonies, set out on a quest to find the treasure in hopes of saving their neighborhood. The treasure is in a cavern, but the entrance to the cavern is under the house of evil thief Mama Fratelli and her sons Jake Fratelli, Francis Fratelli, and the severely disfigured Lotney ""Sloth"" Fratelli. Sloth befriends the Goonies and decides to help them.

","The Goonies, a group of friends living in the ""Goon Docks"" neighborhood of Astoria, Oregon, face foreclosure on their families' homes from the expanding Astoria Country Club. On one of their last days their morale sinks particularly low due to Mikey's older brother having failed his driver's license exam, thwarting their plans to ""cruise the coast in style"" during their ""last Goonies weekend."" While rummaging through the Walshes' attic, they find an old newspaper clipping, a Spanish map, and an artifact relating to a rumor of a lost but not forgotten pirate treasure somewhere in the area. Hearing the call of adventure, Mikey tries to persuade his friends to join him in search for the treasure hoarded by a pirate named One-Eyed Willie. Initially reluctant, the group eventually decides to evade the authority of Mikey's older brother, Brandon, and escape for one last ""Goonie adventure.""
They then head down the coast and stumble upon a derelict seaside restaurant that seems to match coordinates set by the map and an old doubloon, unaware that the Fratellis, a family of fugitives, are using the restaurant as their hideout. After first encountering the family, the Goonies come back after the Fratellis have left and discover their criminal intents, and send Chunk, the group's clumsy, heavy-set dreamer and teller of tall tales, to get help. However, the Fratellis return before they can leave, forcing the Goonies to use a cavern underneath the restaurant to escape. The Fratellis capture Chunk and interrogate him, learning nothing until a pack of bats burst out of the cavern beneath the restaurant. Chunk is placed in the same room with the forsaken and deformed Fratelli brother, Sloth, while the rest of the Fratellis enter the cavern and follow the Goonies' trail.
As the Goonies traverse the cavern, Mikey discovers that it matches up with the map and convinces the rest of the group to continue to follow it to find the treasure. They overcome many deadly traps set by One-Eyed Willie, and eventually arrive at a large underground cavern and a lagoon where Willie's ship, the Inferno, lies waiting. While others begin to fill their pockets with the riches on the ship, Mikey finds Willie's skeleton, and reverently acknowledges him as the ""first Goonie"", leaving part of the treasure with him as tribute. However, as the Goonies exit the hold, they are caught by the Fratellis, who take their treasure and force the kids to walk the plank. The Goonies are saved by the timely arrival of Chunk and Sloth, now close friends, who help the rest of the group to shore. With the children no longer a threat, the Fratellis ransack the rest of the ship, including the share of the treasure Mikey left for Willie. This sets off a final booby trap, causing the cave to begin collapsing. The Goonies flee through a hole in the cave, finding themselves on a beach. Two passing policemen spot them and call in for help.
The Goonies are soon reunited with their parents while the Fratellis are arrested and Chunk offers to take Sloth into his home. As the Astoria Country Club calls upon Mikey's father to sign over the deed to his property, Rosalita, the Walshes' maid, discovers that Mikey's marble bag contains a large handful of jewels taken from the ship. Mikey's father quickly estimates that its value is more than enough to save everyone's homes. As the families celebrate, they spot the unmanned Inferno, now free of the cave, sailing away.","exciting,excitement,adventure,sentimental,treasure,friendship,feel good,humorous,anticipation",3541.jpg,1985-06-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-goonies/id285883012?uo=4,pPZ229husSM,,,"Action & Adventure,Comedy,Kids & Family"
2854,The Graduate,"'The Graduate' tells the story of a college graduate (Hoffman) who has an affair with an older woman, but then falls in love with her extremely attractive daughter.
Recent college graduate Benjamin Braddock is trapped into an affair with Mrs. Robinson, who happens to be the wife of his father's business partner and then finds himself falling in love with her daughter, Elaine.
Ben has recently graduated college, with his parents now expecting great things from him. At his ""Homecoming"" party, Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's business partner, has Ben drive her home, which leads to an affair between the two.

","""Are you here for an affair?"" These lines and others became cultural touchstones, as 1960s youth rebellion seeped into the California upper middle-class in Mike Nichols' landmark hit. Mentally adrift the summer after graduating from college, suburbanite Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman) would rather float in his parents' pool than follow adult advice about his future. But the exhortation of family friend Mr. Robinson (Murray Hamilton) to seize every possible opportunity inspires Ben to accept an offer of sex from icily feline Mrs. Robinson (Anne Bancroft). The affair and the pool are all well and good until Ben is pushed to go out with the Robinsons' daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross) and he falls in love with her. Mrs. Robinson sabotages the relationship and an understandably disgusted Elaine runs back to college. Determined not to let Elaine get away, Ben follows her to school and then disrupts her family-sanctioned wedding. None too happy about her pre-determined destiny, Elaine flees with Ben -- but to what? Directing his second feature film after Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, Nichols matched the story's satire of suffocating middle-class shallowness with an anti-Hollywood style influenced by the then-voguish French New Wave. Using odd angles, jittery editing, and evocative widescreen photography, Nichols welded a hip New Wave style and a generation-gap theme to a fairly traditional screwball comedy script by Buck Henry and Calder Willingham from Charles Webb's novel. Adding to the European art film sensibility, the movie offers an unsettling and ambiguous ending with no firm closure. And rather than Robert Redford, Nichols opted for a less glamorous unknown for the pivotal role of Ben, turning Hoffman into a star and opening the door for unconventional leading men throughout the 1970s. With a pop-song score written by Paul Simon and performed by Simon & Garfunkel bolstering its contemporary appeal.","biting,cynical,witty,humorous,stylized,sexual,offbeat,captivating",2854.jpg,1967-12-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-graduate/id306021701?uo=4,CVw_-PF3PFs,,,"Classics,Comedy,Drama,Romance"
674,The Great Dictator,"Dictator Adenoid Hynkel has a doppelganger, a poor but kind Jewish barber living in the slums, who one day is mistaken for Hynkel.
Twenty years after the end of WWI in which the nation of Tomainia was on the losing side, Adenoid Hynkel has risen to power as the ruthless dictator of the country. He believes in a pure Aryan state, and the decimation of the Jews. This situation is unknown to a simple Jewish-Tomainian barber who has since been hospitalized the result of a WWI battle. Upon his release, the barber, who had been suffering from memory loss about the war, is shown the new persecuted life of the Jews by many living in the Jewish ghetto, including a washerwoman named Hannah, with whom he begins a relationship. The barber is ultimately spared such persecution by Commander Schultz, who he saved in that WWI battle. The lives of all Jews in Tomainia are eventually spared with a policy shift by Hynkel himself, who is doing so for ulterior motives. But those motives include a want for world domination, starting with the invasion of neighboring Osterlich, which may be threatened by Benzino Napaloni, the dictator of neighboring Bacteria. Ultimately Schultz, who has turned traitor against Hynkel's regime, and the barber, may be able to join forces to take control of the situation, they using Schultz's inside knowledge of the workings of the regime and the barber's uncanny resemblance to one of those in power. 

In his controversial masterpiece, Charlie Chaplin offers both a cutting caricature of Adolf Hitler and a sly tweaking of his own comic persona. Chaplin, in his first pure talkie, brings his sublime physicality to two roles: the cruel yet clownish ‚Äö√Ñ√∂Tomainian dictator and the kindly Jewish barber who is mistaken for him. Featuring Jack Oakie and Paulette Goddard in stellar supporting turns The Great Dictator, boldly going after the fascist leader before the U.S‚Äö√Ñ√¥s official entry into World War II, is an audacious amalgam of politics and slapstick that culminates in Chaplin‚Äö√Ñ√¥s famously impassioned speech.

","""This is the story of the period between two world wars--an interim during which insanity cut loose, liberty took a nose dive, and humanity was kicked around somewhat."" With this pithy opening title, Charles Chaplin begins his first all-talking feature film, The Great Dictator. During World War I, a Jewish barber (Chaplin) in the army of Tomania saves the life of high-ranking officer Schultz (Reginald Gardiner). While Schultz survives the conflict unscathed, the barber is stricken with amnesia and bundled off to a hospital. Twenty years pass: Tomania has been taken over by dictator Adenoid Hynkel (Chaplin again) and his stooges Garbitsch (Henry Daniell) and Herring (Billy Gilbert). Hynkel despises all Jews and regularly wreaks havoc on the Tomanian Jewish ghetto, where feisty Hannah (Paulette Goddard) lives. Meanwhile, the little barber escapes from the hospital and instinctively heads back to his cobweb-laden ghetto barber shop. Unaware of Hynkel's policy towards Jews (in fact, he's unaware of Hynkel), the barber gets into a slapstick confrontation with a gang of Aryan storm troopers. He is rescued by his old friend Schultz, now one of Hynkel's most loyal officers. Thanks to Schultz's protection, the ghetto receives a brief respite from Hynkel's persecution. The barber sets up shop again, developing a warm platonic relationship with the lovely Hannah. But things take a sorry turn when Hynkel, angered that a Jewish banker has refused to finance his impending war with Austerlitz, begins bearing down again on the Ghetto. Near the end of the film, when the dictator is expected to make another one of his hate-filled, war-mongering speeches, the barber steps up to the microphones...and Charles Chaplin drops character and becomes ""himself,"" delivering an impassioned plea for peace, tolerance, and humanity.","witty,humorous,biting,sentimental",674.jpg,1940-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-great-dictator/id481843688?uo=4,k8bVG8XC-4I,,,"Classics,Comedy,Drama"

","John Dahl directed this war drama based on the true story of one of the most daring military actions of World War II. In the waning days of World War II, General Douglas MacArthur chose to make good on a pledge that he made in 1942 -- that he would return to the Philippines after he and his troops were forced to retreat. However, MacArthur's determination was more than a matter of pride. Over 500 American soldiers were being held in Cabanatuan, a notoriously brutal prisoner of war camp in the Philippines operated by the Japanese army, and MacArthur wanted to see to it that they made it home. MacArthur chose Lt. Col. Henry Mucci (Benjamin Bratt) to lead the Sixth Ranger Battalion on a mission 30 miles behind enemy lines to infiltrate Cabanatuan and liberate the American prisoners. With the help of Capt. Prince (James Franco), Mucci leads his men on a life-or-death raid against forces known for their savagery. The Great Raid was based on William B.

3455,The Green Mile,"The lives of guards on Death Row are affected by one of their charges: a black man accused of child murder and rape, yet who has a mysterious gift.

Oscar nominated best picture adaptation of a Stephen King novel about a gentle giant of a prisoner with supernatural powers, who brings a sense of spirit and humanity to his guards and fellow inmates. Oscar award winning actor Tom Hanks heads the cast in this emotionally riveting story.

Based on a Stephen King novel set in a prison. In 1935, inmates at the Cold Mountain Correctional Facility call Death Row ""The Green Mile"" because of the dark green linoleum that tiles the floor. Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) is the head guard on the Green Mile when a new inmate is brought into his custody: John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), convicted of the sadistic murder of two young girls. Despite his size and the fearsome crimes for which he's serving time, Coffey seems to be a kind and well-mannered person who behaves more like an innocent child than a hardened criminal. Soon Edgecomb and two of his fellow guards, Howell (David Morse) and Stanton Barry Pepper), notice something odd about Coffey: he's able to perform what seem to be miracles of healing among his fellow inmates, leading them to wonder just what sort of person he could be, and if he could have committed the crimes with which he was charged. The Green Mile also stars James Cromwell as the warden; Michael Jeter, Sam Rockwell, and Graham Greene as inmates awaiting dates with the electric chair; and Harry Dean Stanton as a clever trustee.

","In a Louisiana nursing home in 1999, Paul Edgecomb (Greer) begins to cry while watching the film Top Hat. His elderly friend Elaine (Brent) shows concern for him, and Paul tells her that the film reminded him of when he was a corrections officer in charge of death row inmates at Cold Mountain Penitentiary during the summer of 1935. The scene shifts to 1935, where Paul (Hanks) works with fellow guards Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (Morse), Harry Terwilliger (DeMunn), and Dean Stanton (Pepper).
One day, John Coffey (Duncan), a giant black man convicted of raping and killing two young white girls, arrives on death row. However, he is shy, soft-spoken, and emotional. John reveals extraordinary powers by healing Paul's urinary tract infection and resurrecting a mouse. Later, he heals the terminally ill wife (Clarkson) of Warden Hal Moores (Cromwell). When John is asked to explain his power, he merely says that he ""took it back.""
Percy Wetmore (Hutchison), a sadist with a fierce temper, has recently begun working on the mile; his fellow guards dislike him, but cannot get rid of him because of his family connections to the governor. He demands to manage the execution of Eduard Delacroix (Jeter), promising that afterward, he will transfer to an administrative post at a mental hospital. An agreement is made, but Percy then deliberately sabotages the execution: Instead of wetting the sponge used to conduct electricity and make executions quick and effective, he leaves it dry, causing the execution to malfunction dramatically.
Meanwhile, a violent prisoner named ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Rockwell) has arrived, to be executed for multiple murders committed during a robbery. At one point he seizes John's arm, and John psychically senses that Wharton is also responsible for the crime for which John was convicted and sentenced to death. John ""takes back"" the sickness in Hal's wife and regurgitates it into Percy, who then shoots Wharton to death and falls into a state of permanent catatonia. Percy is then admitted to Briar Ridge Mental Hospital as a patient rather than an administrator. In the wake of these events, Paul interrogates John, who says he ""punished them bad men"" and offers to show Paul what he saw. John takes Paul's hand and says he has to give Paul ""a part of himself"" in order for Paul to see what really happened to the girls.
Paul asks John what he should do, if he should open the door and let John walk away. John tells him that there is too much pain in the world, to which he is sensitive, and says he is ""rightly tired of the pain"" and is ready to rest. For his last request on the night before his execution, John watches the film Top Hat. When John is put in the electric chair, he asks Paul not to put the traditional black hood over his head because he is afraid of the dark. Paul agrees, shakes his hand, and John is executed.
As an elderly Paul finishes his story, he notes that he requested a transfer to a youth detention center, where he spent the remainder of his career. Elaine questions his statement that he had a fully grown son at the time, and Paul explains that he was 44 years old at the time of John's execution and that he is now 108. This is apparently a side effect of John giving a ""part of himself"" to Paul. Mr. Jingles, Del's mouse resurrected by John, is also still alive ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ but Paul believes his outliving all of his relatives and friends (including Elaine, who is shown to have died at the end of the movie) to be a punishment from God for having John executed, and wonders how long it will be before his own death.","supernatural power,prison guard,sadism,barbecue,three piece suit,psychic power,urinary tract infection,capital punishment,wrongful conviction,strait jacket,esp,gun,miracles,killer,spirituality,pray,louisiana,child murder,sparks,prison,intolerance,social injustice,racial injustice,southern u.s.,electric,death row,healer,prisoner,bladder infection,cure,electrical storm,monologue,electric chair,baton,astaire and rogers,stomp,healing,execution,riveting,humanity,miracle,toilet,redemption,warden,big guy,criminal,nursing home,1930s,surprise,prison life,poetic justice,convict,death penalty,fire extinguisher,flashback,wetting pants,tall,offbeat,staircase,murder,racism,suspenders,miracle,sentimental,urination,extrasensory perception,faith,trust,corn bread,wee,jail,compassion,electric chair,tragic hero,chair,crucifix,spiritual healing,supernatural,coward,christianity,emotional,touching,contemplative,god,pee,spirit,mouse,racism",3455.jpg,1999-12-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-green-mile/id283270111?uo=4,ctRK-4Vt7dA,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
2258,The Grey,"After their plane crashes in Alaska, six oil workers are led by a skilled huntsman to survival, but a pack of merciless wolves haunts their every step.
In The Grey, Liam Neeson leads an unruly group of oil-rig roughnecks when their plane crashes into the remote Alaskan wilderness. Battling mortal injuries and merciless weather, the survivors have only a few days to escape the icy elements - and a vicious pack of rogue wolves on the hunt - before their time runs out.

Liam Neeson stars as the unlikely hero Ottway in this undeniably suspenseful and powerful survival adventure. After their plane crashes into the remote Alaskan wilderness, a roughneck group of oil drillers is forced to find a way back to civilization. As Ottway leads the injured survivors through the brutal snow and ice, they are relentlessly tracked by a vicious pack of rogue wolves that will do anything to defend their territory. Adrenaline-fueled, action-packed and loaded with some of the most intense and brutally realistic attack scenes ever filmed, The Grey is being hailed as a thriller you can sink your teeth into!

","John Ralph Ottway (Liam Neeson) works in Alaska killing wolves that threaten an oil drilling team. On his last day on the job, Ottway writes a letter to his wife Ana (Anne Openshaw) in which he explains his plans to commit suicide. While holding the barrel of a rifle in his mouth, Ottway hears the howl of a wolf and does not pull the trigger. Upon completing the job, the team and Ottway head home on a plane that crashes during a blizzard. Ottway then sees a vision of his wife urging him not to feel afraid, a motif that recurs throughout the film. When Ottway awakens he finds one of the team members, Lewenden (James Badge Dale), mortally wounded: Ottway calms him, letting him know that he is going to die, and then Lewenden dies peacefully.
Ottway sets the survivors to task collecting material for a fire. He sees a woman in apparent need of help, but discovers that what he thought were her cries actually were the noises of a grey wolf which is eating her, and he is attacked by it. He is rescued by the others and explains that they are most likely in the wolves' territory. After lighting a fire, the survivors take turns keeping watch. While urinating, Hernandez (Ben Bray) is killed by two wolves. The remaining survivors find his body in the morning and Ottway suggests they leave the crash site because there they are likely to get attacked. Diaz (Frank Grillo) questions Ottway's leadership and begins defying his orders. Before they leave, Ottway and the others remove the wallets from many of the bodies with the intention of returning them to surviving family members. Diaz finds an emergency wrist watch containing a wire antenna that he says should attract any nearby planes. Hendrick (Dallas Roberts) says a prayer and thanks God for allowing them to survive the crash and then they leave the site.
While hiking through the snow, Flannery (Joe Anderson) falls and is killed by three wolves. The remaining survivors continue on and set camp in the woods. While walking, one of the members notices a pack of wolves running towards them. The group runs for the trees and begins to light a fire to keep the wolves off. The tension between Ottway and Diaz comes to a head as the survivors create makeshift weaponry. Diaz threatens Ottway with his knife, but is disarmed by him. The survivors meet the alpha wolf, which sends an omega to test Diaz. However, the survivors are able to kill the wolf and eat it. Diaz cuts off its head and throws it back as a symbol of defiance. The others see this as an unwise move as one of them notes that besides humans, wolves are the only creatures known to take revenge.
The group stops to build a campfire at night and they start a conversation. Diaz tells the group how in his opinion the men who died are not in heaven and there is no god; Talget (Dermot Mulroney) states that he believes in God, while Ottway says that he too is an atheist, but that he wishes he could believe. Burke (Nonso Anozie) awakens and begins to hallucinate from hypoxia. He goes back to sleep in front of the campfire. The group bonds over personal stories and Ottway tells them about a poem that is hung above his father's desk, a poem that contributes to the film's major theme. He recites it:
""Once more into the fray...
Into the last good fight I'll ever know.
Live and die on this day...
Live and die on this day...""

A blizzard approaches and the group tries to preserve the fire to prevent hypothermia. Ottway finds Burke's frozen lifeless body in the morning. Further in their travels, the survivors come across a high canyon wall within which, screened by trees, they are able to spot a river. Hendrick jumps to the trees, securing a line as a means of traverse. Diaz and Ottway make it across the line to join Hendrick, but Talget, who is afraid of heights, loses his glasses and is initially frozen with fear. He reluctantly continues across, but soon finds that his injured hand has begun bleeding and gets caught up in the makeshift rope. Talget struggles to untangle himself, but the line breaks and he crashes through the trees to the ground. Wounded, Talget sees a vision of his daughter as he is dragged away by the wolves. While attempting to save Talget, Diaz falls from the tree and injures his knee.
The three remaining survivors continue their trek and make it to the river, but an exhausted Diaz can make it no further, preferring to stay and die than go on. Diaz understands that if Ottway and Henrick dragged him along, they would be more likely to get attacked. Thus, he decides to come to terms with his own death. Hendrick tries to convince Diaz to carry on, but Ottway tells him it is futile. They say their final goodbyes, with Ottway and Hendrick leaving Diaz on the riverside, as the crackling of branches caused by wolves is heard. Ottway and Hendrick continue, but are soon chased by wolves again. Fleeing, Hendrick falls into the river and gets his foot stuck between underwater rocks. Ottway jumps into the river attempting save him, but Hendrick drowns. Freezing and alone, Ottway then curses God and asks for His help to no avail. Ottway continues on without his wet coat but he eventually starts developing hypothermia and hallucinates.
Ottway then stops and pulls out each wallet collected from the dead team members, examining the mementos that they contain. He places them on the snow in the shape of a cross, to which he adds his own. Suddenly the pack of wolves surrounds him, leading Ottway to discover that he has walked right into their den. He is soon spotted by the alpha wolf and the other pack members back off. Ottway sees another vision of his wife, revealing that she told him not to be afraid while she died on a hospital bed. Deciding to make a final stand, he puts on the emergency wristwatch using the wire antenna as a garrot, tapes miniature alcohol bottles to his fist and breaks them on a nearby rock as a makeshift weapon and also tapes the knife to his other hand. He quietly recites his father's poem, then charges the alpha wolf before the screen goes black.
In a brief post-credits scene, the back of Ottway's head is seen lying on top of a still-breathing wolf's stomach. It is unknown whether or not he survived, but it appears that the wolf breathes his dying breath, similar to the wolf shot by Ottway at camp earlier in the film.","dead is dead,fucked,sniper,death,fight,fear,man against animal,survival,petroleum,once more into the fray ,seat belt,isolation,prove yourself,man against nature,cursed,let it be,airplane crash,mauling,into the last good fight i'll ever know,don't be afraid,stranded,hope,fate didn't give a fuck,wolf,poem,no survivors,howling,frostbite,motherfucker,machismo,sniper rifle,live and die on this day,good fight,kick ass,sick wife,wolfman,bad luck,male camaraderie,gun in mouth,characters killed one by one,wilderness,wallet,alaska,live and die,letter,fray",2258.jpg,2012-01-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-grey/id509441682?uo=4,"Hfb0-U0ydj8,gqP2o62sZMs",,,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

Sergeant Gerry Boyle is an eccentric small-town Irish cop with a confrontational and crass personality and a subversive sense of humor, a dying mother, a fondness for prostitutes, and absolutely no interest whatsoever in the international cocaine-smuggling ring that has brought straight-laced FBI agent Wendell Everett to his door.

","Celebrating his impending marriage to Tracy Garner, Doug Billings and his friends Phil Wenneck, Stu Price, and Tracy's brother Alan travel to Las Vegas for a bachelor party, staying at Caesars Palace.
The next morning, Phil, Stu and Alan awaken to find they have no memory of the previous night and Doug is nowhere to be found. Stu is missing a tooth, their hotel suite is in disarray, a tiger is in their bathroom, and a baby is in the closet. They find Doug's mattress impaled on a statue outside of their hotel and when they ask for their Mercedes, the valet delivers a police cruiser.
Following clues to their steps, the trio travel to a hospital where they discover they were drugged with rohypnol, causing their memory loss, and that they came to the hospital from a chapel. At the chapel they learn that Stu married a stripper, Jade, despite having a long-term relationship with his mean-spirited girlfriend, Melissa. Outside the chapel, the trio are attacked by gangsters saying they are looking for someone. They flee and visit Jade, discovering that she is the mother of the baby, before being arrested by the police.
Having been told that the Mercedes has been impounded, the trio is released when they volunteer to be targets for a taser demonstration. While driving the Mercedes, they discover a naked man in the trunk who attacks them and flees. Alan confesses that he drugged their drinks to ensure they had a good night, thinking the drug to be ecstasy.
Returning to their villa, they find Mike Tyson, who orders the trio to return the tiger to his mansion immediately. Stu drugs the tiger with the remaining rohypnol and they drive towards Tyson's home in the Mercedes, but the tiger attacks them and damages the car's interior. After pushing the car the rest of the way to avoid the tiger, Tyson shows the trio footage of them stealing the tiger to help them locate Doug. While driving, their car is struck by another vehicle intentionally; the passengers are revealed to be the gangsters from the chapel and their boss, Leslie Chow ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the naked man from their trunk ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ who accuses the trio of stealing $80,000 of his money and kidnapping him. Chow says he has their friend, and threatens to kill him if his money is not returned. Unaware of the location of Chow's $80,000, Alan, with help from Stu and Jade, uses his knowledge of card counting to win $82,400 playing Blackjack. They meet with Chow and exchange the money, only to find that ""Doug"" is the drug dealer who inadvertently sold Alan the roofies.
With the wedding occurring in hours, Phil tells Tracy they cannot find Doug. Following a conversation with ""Black Doug"", Stu realizes where Doug is. The trio travel back to their hotel where they find Doug on the roof, moved there on his mattress while he was asleep, as a practical joke by Stu, Phil and Alan. Before leaving, Stu makes arrangements to go on a date with Jade the following week. With less than four hours before the wedding and with no flights available, the foursome race home, with Doug revealing he has possession of Chow's original $80,000. Despite their late arrival, Doug and Tracy are married and Stu breaks up with Melissa after having grown tired of her controlling his life. As the reception ends, Alan finds Stu's digital camera detailing the events they cannot remember and the four agree to look at the pictures together before deleting the evidence of their exploits.","insecurity,snorricam,mistaken identity,wedding,misadventure,tiger,wedding reception,bride and groom,memory loss,fiancée,drunkenness,toast,beer,partying,sunburn,poker chip,memory loss,interrogation,hangover,amnesia,handcuffs,rectal exam,hotel suite,drink,caesar's palace las vegas,mercedes convertible,party,knocked out,wedding chapel,road trip,jagermeister,mike tyson,drug dealer,used condom,morning after,lost weekend,las vegas nevada,binge drinking,bachelor party,hedonism,stripper,drugged,thong,the belagio,abandoned baby,monster energy drink,camaraderie,prostitute,drunk,taser,stupidity,groom,escort,motel,gangster,infant,kidnapping,las vegas wedding,migraine,wedding picture,tooth pulling,inflatable toy,heirloom,drinking,dentist,marriage,hangover,humorous,stun gun,milf,told in flashback,mercedes,missing tooth,las vegas wedding chapel,womanizer,gambling,farce,headache,card counting,mercedes benz,engagement ring",367.jpg,2009-06-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-hangover/id323818693?uo=4,jj6wcUes1no,,,Comedy

7300,The Help,"An aspiring author during the civil rights movement of the 1960s decides to write a book detailing the African-American maids' point of view on the white families for which they work, and the hardships they go through on a daily basis.
Set in Mississippi during the 1960s, Skeeter (Stone) is a southern society girl who returns from college determined to become a writer, but turns her friends' lives -- and a Mississippi town -- upside down when she decides to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent southern families. Aibileen (Davis), Skeeter's best friend's housekeeper, is the first to open up -- to the dismay of her friends in the tight-knit black community. Despite Skeeter's life-long friendships hanging in the balance, she and Aibileen continue their collaboration and soon more women come forward to tell their stories -- and as it turns out, they have a lot to say. Along the way, unlikely friendships are forged and a new sisterhood emerges, but not before everyone in town has a thing or two to say themselves when they become unwittingly -- and unwillingly -- caught up in the changing times.

","The Movie: A proper, ""they don't make 'em like they used to"" melodrama about a journalist (Emma Stone) who decides to write a book about the experience of black servants in racist Mississippi.

A rare case of an Oscar-bait adaptation of a bestselling novel that works. Don't be surprised if Viola Davis walks away with a golden statuette next year.The tensions of the segregated South have been explored more darkly and deftly in better tomes and films. But Kathryn Stockett's bestseller was embraced by millions charmed by the female dynamics at work amid the Jim Crow laws.

This deft addressing of difficult subjects was ripe for a movie and top marks to Disney for lining up a talented cast to play the inhabitants of 1963 Jackson, Mississippi. In their hands, what could be mushy becomes genuinely stirring. 

Emma Stone leads as Skeeter, whose journalistic ambitions and anger over the racism she witnesses prompt her to seek out black maids to tell their stories. 

Stoic Aibileen (Viola Davis) spills first, then feisty Minny (Octavia Spencer) until a whole town bear witness to the daily cruelty they face. Could this group of oven-stooped women become revolution in its own right? Yes, ma'am.

Evocatively directed by Southern-bred Tate Taylor, The Help is Cool-Whip light, sweet as pie in places and as flimsy as one of Miss Aibileen's meringues. But what you'll want second helpings of is Spencer's sassy comic timing, Davis' humility, Stone's innate likeability, Bryce Dallas Howard's queenbee bitchery, Jessica Chastain's wounded flooziness and Allison Janney's brilliant brand of crazy.

Make no mistake, this is ladies' night, with top role models, spot-on performances and a palpable sense of women being able to change the world in a time when not only ethnic minorities struggled to be heard. No mean feat, and no doubt the girl-power ticket to Oscar nods.

A faithful, heart-warming adaptation that will satisfy fans of the book, divert the uninitiated and tickle the Academy's fancy. You'll never look at a chocolate pie the same way again.

7284,The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,,"On his 111th birthday, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins decides to write down the full story of the adventure he had 60 years earlier, for the benefit of his nephew Frodo.
Long before Bilbo's involvement, the Dwarf Thr‚àö‚â•r becomes King of the Lonely Mountain and brings an era of prosperity to his kin until the arrival of Smaug the Dragon. Smaug destroys the nearby town of Dale before driving the Dwarves out of the mountain and taking their hoard of gold. Thr‚àö‚â•r's grandson Thorin sees King Thranduil and his Wood-elves on a nearby hillside and is dismayed when they take their leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorin's everlasting hatred of Elves.
In the Shire, young Bilbo is tricked by the wizard Gandalf the Grey into hosting a party for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: Balin, Dwalin, F‚àö‚â†li, K‚àö‚â†li, Dori, Nori, Ori, ‚àö√¨in, Gl‚àö‚â•in, Bifur, Bofur and Bombur. Gandalf's aim is to recruit Bilbo as the Dwarves' ""burglar"" to help them steal their treasure back from Smaug. Bilbo reluctantly joins the company on their journey to the Lonely Mountain. Traveling onward, the company gets captured by Trolls. Bilbo stalls them from eating the company until dawn, when Gandalf exposes the Trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. They search the Trolls' cave and find treasure and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade‚Äö√Ñ√ÆOrcrist and Glamdring, respectively‚Äö√Ñ√Æwith the latter finding an Elven shortsword, which he gives to Bilbo.
The company encounters Radagast the Brown, a wizard who lives in Greenwood. He tells them of an encounter at Dol Guldur with a Necromancer who has been corrupting the forest with dark magic. The company is chased by Orcs on Wargs, with Radagast covering their escape. Gandalf leads the company through a stone passage to Rivendell as the Wargs and Orcs are slain by Elven riders led by Lord Elrond. Elrond reads Thorin's map and discloses that the Lonely Mountain has a secret door which will be visible only on Durin's Day. Gandalf talks with the White Council consisting of Elrond, Galadriel and Saruman the White. He tells them about his involvement with the Dwarves, presenting a Morgul-blade Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to the Witch-king of Angmar and may attempt to use Smaug. Saruman is skeptical, not believing the Necromancer to be a true threat.
Without Gandalf, the company journeys into the Misty Mountains, where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between Stone Giants. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by Goblins, who take them to their leader, the Great Goblin. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a cave where he encounters Gollum, who accidentally drops a mysterious ring while killing a stray Goblin to eat. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins and eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Realizing that he lost the ring, Gollum suspects that Bilbo possesses it and attacks the hobbit. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility and evades a furious Gollum, following him to an exit. Bilbo considers killing Gollum, but spares him out of pity and escapes.
Meanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that Azog, an Orc war-chief who beheaded Thr‚àö‚â•r and lost his forearm to Thorin in battle outside the Dwarven kingdom of Moria, has placed a bounty on Thorin's head. Gandalf arrives and saves the Dwarves from the Goblins, killing the Great Goblin during their escape. Bilbo rejoins the group, keeping the ring he found secret. Ambushed by Azog and his hunting party, the company take refuge in trees. Thorin charges Azog, but is defeated and knocked to the ground. Bilbo saves Thorin from the Orcs before the company is rescued by the Eagles who fly them to the safety of the Carrock. Gandalf heals the unconscious Thorin who acknowledges Bilbo's bravery. In the distance, the company sees the Lonely Mountain. The company also see a thrush flying about, which then heads to the Lonely mountain. There, the thrush catches a snail and knocks its shell against the mountainside, awakening the sleeping Smaug, who is lying beneath a golden hoard.","wilhelm scream,troll,test,wizard,dwarf,giant,ogre,king,unexpected guests,fate,goblin,hide,fight,fire,invisibility,good versus evil,bow and arrow,necromancer,monster,map,journey,journey,quest,prequel,fire breathing dragon,magical ring,surprise,ancient,courage,ring,sword,witty,uninvited guest,elf,leaving home,orc,axe,riddle,my precious,flashback,warrior,unexpected visitor,hobbit,writing a letter,quick wit,invisible,treasure,emaciation,quest,sword fight,climbing a tree,buried treasure,middle earth,sword and sorcery,dragon,mountain",7284.jpg,2012-12-14,,SDnYMbYB-nU,,,"Science Fiction & Fantasy,Action & Adventure"

Part entertainment, part brutal retribution for a past rebellion, the televised games are broadcast throughout Panem. The 24 participants are forced to eliminate their competitors while the citizens of Panem are required to watch. When 16-year-old Katniss's young sister, Prim, is selected as District 12's female representative, Katniss volunteers to take her place. She and her male counterpart Peeta, are pitted against bigger, stronger representatives, some of whom have trained for this their whole lives. 

Every year in the ruins of what was once North America, the evil Capitol of the nation of Panem forces each of its twelve districts to send a teenage boy and girl to compete in the Hunger Games. A twisted punishment for a past uprising and an ongoing government intimidation tactic, The Hunger Games are a nationally televised event in which ""Tributes"" must fight with one another until one survivor remains. Pitted against highly-trained Tributes who have prepared for these Games their entire lives, Katniss is forced to rely upon her sharp instincts as well as the mentorship of drunken former victor Haymitch Abernathy. If she's ever to return home to District 12, Katniss must make impossible choices in the arena that weigh survival against humanity and life against love. -- (C) Lionsgate

","Bourdin, who turned out to have a long record of impersonating various different children, real or imaginary, embellished his claim to be Nicholas by alleging that he had been kidnapped for purposes of sexual abuse by Mexican, European, and U.S. military personnel and transported from Texas to Spain. His impersonation fooled several officials in Spain and the U.S., and he was apparently accepted by many of Nicholas' family members, even though he was seven years older than Nicholas, spoke with a strange accent, and had brown eyes and dark hair rather than Nicholas' blue eyes and blond hair. The impersonation was eventually unearthed as a result of the suspicions of a private investigator, Charles (Charlie) Parker, and an FBI agent, Nancy Fisher. Bourdin subsequently made a full confession, and in the movie he elaborates on the various stages in his impersonation.
The film raises, but does not resolve, the question of how the family came so readily to accept the impersonation. Parker, Fisher and Bourdin himself suggest, but cannot provide conclusive evidence for, the possibility that some in the family may have known more than they revealed about (or even been directly implicated in) Nicholas' disappearance, in which case his purported ""reappearance"" could have proved convenient from their point of view.
Because many of the events depicted in the film were not filmed when they happened, the film re-creates some of them with actors.","disappearance,french accent,private investigator,impersonating children,impostor,spain,evidence,sexual abuse,fbi agent,imaginary,texas,reappearance,kidnap,impersonating,missing child,torture victim,conclusive evidence,mythomania,police investigation,identity theft,stolen identity,san antonio texas,reenactment,frenchman",7296.jpg,2012-08-24,,auG_IuMHGZo,,,Documentary
3469,The Incredible Hulk,"Academy Award nominee Edward Norton stars as scientist Bruce Banner, a man who has been living in shadows, scouring the planet for an antidote to the unbridled force of rage within him: the Hulk. But when the military masterminds who dream of exploiting his powers force him back to civilization, he finds himself coming face to face with his most formidable foe: the Abomination a nightmarish beast of pure aggression whose powers match the Hulk‚Äö√Ñ√¥s own! Also starring Liv Tyler, Oscar nominee Tim Roth, and Oscar winner William Hurt, The Incredible Hulk is steeped in action and spectacular special effects (Claudia Puig, USA TODAY) and delivers a mind-blowing final showdown that can only be summed up with one word...INCREDIBLE!","t Culver University in Virginia, General Thaddeus ""Thunderbolt"" Ross (William Hurt) meets with Dr. Bruce Banner (Edward Norton), the colleague and lover of his daughter Betty (Liv Tyler), regarding an experiment which is meant, as Ross claims, to make humans immune to gamma radiation. The experiment‚Äö√Ñ√Æwhich is part of an operation Ross hopes will restart Dr. Abraham Erskine's failed ""super soldier"" program (that created Captain America)‚Äö√Ñ√Æfails and exposes Banner to huge amounts of gamma radiation. This has the effect of transforming Banner into the Hulk whenever Banner becomes angry. As the Hulk, he destroys the lab and injures Betty. Afterwards, he flees the scene. Banner, realizing what he had done, leaves the U.S, becoming a fugitive from the U.S. military on orders by Ross.
Five years later, Banner works at a bottling factory in Rocinha, Rio de Janeiro, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the Internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as ""Mr. Blue"", and to whom he is ""Mr. Green"". He is also learning meditative breathing techniques from a martial arts expert (Rickson Gracie) to help keep control, and has not transformed in record 158 days. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by a consumer (Stan Lee) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, creating medical complications. Using the bottle to triangulate Banner's location, Ross sends a team, led by British Royal Marine Emil Blonsky (Tim Roth) to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a serum developed as part of the same operation, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility and healing, but after time it begins to deform his skeleton.
Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, who is dating psychiatrist Leonard Samson (Ty Burrell). Banner is attacked by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson. The Hulk dispatches Ross and Blonsky's team and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run. Banner makes contact with Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. He turns out to be cellular biologist Dr. Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, though he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation, Sterns reveals he has synthesized Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its ""limitless potential"" to medicine. Appalled and fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner attempts to convince Sterns to destroy the blood supply. Ross' forces attack and take Banner into custody with Betty.
Blonsky forces Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns warns that the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an ""abomination"". Unconcerned, Blonsky forces Sterns to administer the blood and a gamma charge. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with strength surpassing that of the Hulk. Abomination then attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood into a cut on his forehead causing it to bulge and mutate him. Abomination then rampages through Harlem. The basic problem is that, unlike Hulk, Abomination cannot revert back to normal Blonsky state.
Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Abomination, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Abomination by choking him with a huge chain, relenting only after Betty's plea to spare him. After having a small, peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees from the scene, and Banner escapes from New York.
A month later, Banner is in Bella Coola, British Columbia. Instead of trying to suppress his transformation, he is attempting to transform in a controlled manner. As his eyes turn green, a grin appears on his face.
In a local bar, General Ross is approached by Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), who reveals that a ""team"" is being formed.","opening action scene,mr. hyde,hand to hand combat,new clothes,change,science experiment,angry,stylized,bare chest,mass,beast,destruction,monster versus monster,ripped clothes,fight,experiment,on the run,body building,too big,monster,rough,morph,exciting,cure,huge,green,experiment gone wrong,antidote,dr. jekyll,bare foot,hulk,mercenary,hero,scientist,military,fugitive,bicep,wrestling,hulk,enormous,muscle,smash,bulk,violence,rugby,ripped,one man army,massive,suspenseful,american football,super villain,strangulation,vomit,gamma ray,sumo,pissed off,furious,gloomy",3469.jpg,2008-06-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-incredible-hulk/id284829497?uo=4,"l0i0RNk8wow,eny_pHgl4kM",,,"Action & Adventure,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
468,The Incredibles,"From the Academy Award winning creators of Toy Story, Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo, comes this hilarious action-packed computer-animated adventure about superheroes.  Bob Paar (Craig T. Nelson) used to be one of the world's greatest superheroes (known to all as ""Mr. Incredible""), saving lives and fighting evil on a daily basis, but now he's a clock-punching insurance claims adjuster fighting boredom and a bulging waistline.  When an unfortunate string of mishaps and frivolous law suits forced all of the legendary crime fighters to hang up their super suits fifteen years ago, Bob and his wife Helen (Holly Hunter), a famous former superhero in her own right, adopted civilian identities and retreated to the suburbs to live normal lives with their three kids.  Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secret assignment.  When he discovers the evil genius Syndrome (Jason Lee) bent on diabolical revenge is behind the mystery, his family flies to the rescue for an extraordinary battle of wits and superpowers.  Pixar Animation Studios makes technological advances in portraying human characters and stretches the boundaries of the art form with this stylish and entertaining film.","""Supers""‚Äö√Ñ√Æhumans gifted with superpowers‚Äö√Ñ√Æwere once seen as heroes, but collateral damage from their various good deeds and with countless lawsuits filed against them led the government to create a ""Supers Relocation Program"", forcing the Supers to fit in among the civilians and not use their superpowers. Bob and Helen Parr, who are Supers, have married and now have three children, Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack in the suburbs of Metroville‚Äö√Ñ√Æa Metropolitan area. Violet and Dash have innate superpowers, but the toddler Jack-Jack has yet to show any. Bob, stuck in a white-collar job at an insurance agency, reminisces of his former days as Mr. Incredible, and sneaks out on Wednesday nights with his Super friend, Lucius Best (a.k.a. Frozone) to fight street crime.
One day, Bob loses his temper with his boss who refuses to let Bob help a mugging victim just outside the building, which results in Bob revealing his super strength and losing his job. While trying to figure out what to tell Helen, he finds a message from a woman named ""Mirage"", who asks for Mr. Incredible's help to stop a rogue robot on a distant island called Nomanisan for a lucrative reward. Bob, claiming to Helen that he is going on a business trip, takes up Mirage's offer, and successfully defeats the powerful Omnidroid (v x8). On his return to Metroville, Bob spends his days working out and getting back into shape. He takes his super suit, torn in the battle with the Omnidroid, to Edna Mode, the fashion designer to the Supers, and asks her to repair it. She does so, and also insists on creating a new, better super suit for him. She refuses his request to add a cape, though, highlighting how this accessory has doomed several other Supers before him by getting caught on things.
Mirage soon contacts Bob with another job on the same island. When Bob goes to the meeting room, Mirage was supposed to be there, he instead finds the Omnidroid (v x9), rebuilt and reprogrammed to be stronger than before. While trapped by the robot, he meets its creator, the technology-savvy villain Syndrome. Bob recognizes him as a young fan, Buddy Pine, who as a teenager wanted to be Mr. Incredible's sidekick IncrediBoy but was turned down, due to Bob preferring to work alone 15 years ago. Syndrome has vowed revenge for this shunning, and sets the Omnidroid to kill Bob. Bob fakes his death and hides from the robot, discovering the body of a former Super, Gazerbeam. His curiosity piqued, he breaks into Syndrome's base and finds a computer, which outlines Syndrome's obsessive work in tracking down former Supers to lure them into fighting the Omnidroid, and using the results of those fatal battles to improve each incarnation of the machine. Bob is relieved to discover that Helen and his children are not yet identified in Syndrome's database, and learns that a final design of the Omnidroid (v x10) will be launched toward Metroville, seemingly to destroy it.
Meanwhile, Helen has become suspicious of Bob having an affair. After discovering Bob's repaired super-suit, she talks to Edna and learns she created new suits for the entire Parr family, each outfitted with a tracking device. Helen triggers Bob's, identifying the remote island but inadvertently revealing Bob's presence to Syndrome's headquarters. After a failed attempt to escape, Bob is captured. Helen borrows a private jet from an old friend and travels to Nomanisan. Midway she learns that Violet and Dash have stowed away while leaving Jack-Jack at home with a babysitter. As they near Nomanisan, Syndrome shoots down the jet, but Helen and the children safely make it ashore. Though Helen rescues Bob and regroups with Violet and Dash as they outrun Syndrome's guards, they are soon captured by Syndrome, who identifies all of them as a family of Supers. With the Parrs contained, Syndrome explains that he will launch the newly perfected Omnidroid to Metroville, sending the city into chaos, upon which he will appear and, using a control band, ""subdue"" the robot and become the city's hero. Syndrome launches the Omnidroid on a rocket and follows in his aircraft. After his departure, Violet escapes and helps to free the rest of the family, and with Mirage's help, they board a second rocket bound for the city.
In Metroville, the Omnidroid starts a path of destruction, and Syndrome enacts his plan, stopping the robot resulting in the people's cheers. The Omnidroid observes the remote-control band and fires it off Syndrome's arm, sending the villain scurrying away while the robot continues to wreck the city. The combined abilities of the Parrs and Lucius are able to best and destroy the robot, and the city welcomes them back as heroes. As they are driven back to their home, Helen anxiously calls the babysitter and learns that Syndrome has abducted Jack-Jack. When they arrive at home, Syndrome is taking the toddler to his jet, planning to raise the boy to fight against the Supers in the future. As Bob and Helen launch a rescue attempt, Jack-Jack reveals his powers of transformation and fire-creation, forcing Syndrome to drop him into Helen's waiting arms. Syndrome tries to escape, but due to Bob's intervening, his cape is caught in the suction of his aircraft's engine, which kills him. The ruined plane crashes into the Parrs' home, but Violet is able to protect the family from harm using her powers of force-field.
Three months later, the Parrs have re-adjusted to normal life, but when a new villain, the Underminer, appears, the Parrs put on their masks, ready to battle the new foe.","transformation,heroine,boring job,obsessed fan,laser,secret life,lawsuit,stylized,subterranean fortress,evil plot,villain,bomb,invisibility,family,forcefield,employer employee relationship,ice,cape,jealousy,husband wife relationship,fat,trap,sucked into jet engine,monorail,fun,mask,fired from the job,secret,exciting,self destruction,superhero team,evil genius,giant robot,electric shock,insurance agent,parenthood,action hero,elastic,elasticity,secret identity,sidekick,super-heroes,superheroine,witty,overweight,witness protection,hilarious,mother daughter relationship,hero,flashback,superhero,cgi film,running on water,murder,cubicle,dysfunctional family,teenage girl,incredible,pixar,speed,superhuman speed,father daughter relationship,humorous,superpower,superhero couple,insurance,rescue,action heroine,idle,strength,1950s,touching,midlife crisis,super power,crime fighter,superhero costume,feel good,tragic villain,invention",468.jpg,2004-10-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-incredibles/id188702939?uo=4,rMfrFG_69zM,,,"Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family"
3696,The Informant!,"What was Mark Whitacre thinking? A rising star at agri-industry giant Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Whitacre (Matt Damon) suddenly turns whistleblower. Even as he exposes his company's multi-national price-fixing conspiracy to the FBI, Whitacre envisions himself being hailed as a hero of the common man and handed a promotion. But before all that can happen, the FBI needs evidence, so Whitacre eagerly agrees to wear a wire and carry a hidden tape recorder in his briefcase, imagining himself as a kind of de facto secret agent. Unfortunately for the FBI, their lead witness hasn't been quite so forthcoming about helping himself to the corporate coffers. Whitacre's ever-changing account frustrates the agents (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) and threatens the case against ADM as it becomes almost impossible to decipher what is real and what is the product of Whitacre's active imagination.","Mark Whitacre, a rising star at Decatur, Illinois based Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) in the early 1990s, blows the whistle on the company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s price-fixing tactics at the urging of his wife Ginger.
One night in November 1992, Whitacre confesses to FBI special agent Brian Shepard that ADM executives ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ including Whitacre himself ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ had routinely met with competitors to fix the price of lysine, an additive used in the commercial livestock industry. Whitacre secretly gathers hundreds of hours of video and audio over several years to present to the FBI. He assists in gathering evidence by clandestinely taping the company‚Äö√Ñ√¥s activity in business meetings at various locations around the globe such as Tokyo, Paris, Mexico City, and Hong Kong, eventually collecting enough evidence of collaboration and conspiracy to warrant a raid of ADM.
Whitacre‚Äö√Ñ√¥s good deed dovetails with his own major infractions and his internal, secret struggle with bipolar disorder seems to take over his exploits.The bulk of the film focuses on Whitacre's meltdown resulting from the pressures of wearing a wire and organizing surveillance for the FBI for three years, instigated by Whitacre's reaction, in increasingly manic overlays, to various trivial magazine articles he reads. In a stunning turn of events immediately following the covert portion of the case, headlines around the world report that Whitacre had embezzled $9 million from his own company at the same period of time he was secretly working with/ for the FBI and taping his co-workers, while simultaneously aiming to be elected as ADM CEO following the arrest and conviction of the remaining upper management members. In the ensuing chaos, Whitacre appears to shift his trust and randomly destabilize his relationships with Agent Shepard, his partner Agent Herndon and numerous attorneys in the process.
Authorities at ADM began investigating, in an attempt to cover tracks, the mounted papertrail with forged names and specs that Whitacre had built to cover his own subversive deeds. After being confronted with evidence of his fraud, Whitacre's reasoning and defensive claims begin to spiral out of control, including an accusation of assault and battery against Agent Shepard and the FBI, which had made a substantial move to distance their case from Whitacre entirely. Because of this major infraction and Whitacre‚Äö√Ñ√¥s bizarre behavior, he was sentenced to a prison term three times as long as that meted out to the white-collar criminals he helped to catch. In the epilogue of Whitacre's case, Agent Herndon visits inmate Whitacre in prison as he videotapes a futile appeal to seek a presidential pardon. Overweight, balding and psychologically beaten after his years long ordeal, Mark Whitacre is eventually released from prison with his wife Ginger, waiting to greet him.

2622,The Interpreter,"Political intrigue and deception unfold inside the United Nations, where a US Secret Service agent is assigned to investigate an interpreter who overhears an assassination plot.
Escalating events begin when U.N. interpreter Silvia Broome alleges that she has overheard a death threat against an African head of state, spoken in a rare dialect few people other than Silvia can understand. With the words ""The Teacher will never leave this room alive,"" in an instant, Silvia's life is turned upside down as she becomes a hunted target of the killers. Placed under the protection of federal agent Tobin Keller, Silvia's world only grows more nightmarish. As Keller digs deeper into his eyewitnesses' past and her secretive world of global connections, the more suspicious he becomes that she herself might be involved in the conspiracy. With every step of the way, he finds more reasons to mistrust her. Is Sylvia a victim? A suspect? Or something else entirely? And can Tobin, coping with his own personal heartache, keep her safe? Though they must depend on one another, Silvia and Tobin couldn't be more different. Silvia's strengths are words, diplomacy and the subtleties of meaning, while Tobin is all about instinct, action and reading into the most primal human behaviors. Now, as the danger of a major assassination on U.S. soil grows and Silvia's life hangs in the balance, Silvia and Tobin play out a gripping dance of evasion and revelation that keeps them both guessing as they race to stop a terrifying international crisis before it's too late.

","Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter working at the United Nations in New York City. She was raised in the Republic of Matobo, a fictional African country, but has dual citizenship.
The U.N. is considering indicting Edmond Zuwanie (Earl Cameron), Matobo's president, to stand trial in the International Criminal Court. Initially a liberator, over the past 20 years he has become as corrupt and tyrannical as the government he overthrew, and is now responsible for ethnic cleansing and other atrocities within Matobo. Zuwanie is soon to visit the U.N. and put forward his own case to the General Assembly, in an attempt to avoid the indictment.
A security scare forces the evacuation of the U.N. building, and Silvia returns at night to reclaim some personal belongings. At that time, she overhears discussion of an assassination plot, and runs scared from the building when those discussing the plot become aware of her presence. The next day, Silvia recognizes words in a meeting where she is interpreting from phrases she overheard the night before, and reports the incident to U.N. security; the plot's target appears to be Zuwanie himself. They, in turn, call in the U.S. Secret Service, who assign Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) and Dot Woods (Catherine Keener) to investigate, as well as protect Zuwanie when he arrives. Keller learns that Silvia has, in the past, been involved in a Matoban guerrilla group, that her parents and sister were killed by land mines laid by Zuwanie's men, and that she has dated one of Zuwanie's political opponents. Although Keller is suspicious of Silvia's story, the two grow close and Keller ends up protecting her from attacks on her person. Silvia later finds that her brother Simon and her lover Xola were killed (as shown in the opening scene). The purported assassin is discovered while Zuwanie is in the middle of his address to the General Assembly, and security personnel rush Zuwanie to a safe room for his protection. Silvia, anticipating this, has been hiding in the safe room, and confronts Zuwanie and intends to kill him herself. Keller determines that the assassination plot is a false flag operation created by Zuwanie to gain credibility that his rivals are terrorists and to deter potential supporters of his removal. Keller rushes to the safe room and arrives just in time to prevent Silvia from murdering Zuwanie. Zuwanie is indicted, and Silvia is expelled from the U.S., returning home to Matobo soon afterwards.","suspenseful,mind bending,tense",2622.jpg,2005-04-04, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-interpreter/id299460722?uo=4,a7O8mPlNlRY,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this is an intimate journey into the stubborn persistence of violence in our cities.

From acclaimed director Steve James and bestselling author Alex Kotlowitz, this film is an unusually intimate journey into the stubborn, persistence of violence in our cities. Shot over the course of a year out of Kartemquin Films, The Interrupters captures a period in Chicago when it became a national symbol for the violence in our cities. During that period, the city was besieged by high-profile incidents, most notably the brutal beating of Derrion Albert, a Chicago High School student, whose death was caught on videotape. The film's main subjects work for an innovative organization, CeaseFire, which believes that the spread of violence mimics the spread of infectious diseases, and so the treatment should be similar: go after the most infected, and stop the infection at its source. The singular mission of the ""Violence Interrupters"" - who have credibility on the streets because of their own personal histories -- is to intervene in conflicts before they explode into violence. In The Interrupters, Ameena Matthews, whose father is Jeff Fort, one of the city's most notorious gang leaders, was herself a drug ring enforcer. But having children and finding solace in her Muslim faith pulled her off the streets and grounded her. In the wake of Derrion Albert's death, Ameena becomes a close confidante to his mother, and helps her through her grieving. Ameena, who is known among her colleagues for her fearlessness, befriends a feisty teenaged girl who reminds her of herself at that age. The film follows that friendship over the course of many months, as Ameena tries to nudge the troubled girl in the right direction. Cobe Williams, scarred by his father's murder, was in and out of prison, until he had had enough. His family - particularly a young son - helped him find his footing. Cobe disarms others with his humor and his general good nature. His most challenging moment comes when he has to confront a man so bent on revenge that Cobe has to pat him down to make sure he's put away his gun. Like Ameena, he gets deeply involved in the lives of those he encounters, including a teenaged boy just out of prison and a young man from his old neighborhood who's squatting in a foreclosed home. Eddie Bocanegra is haunted by a murder he committed when he was seventeen. His CeaseFire work is a part of his repentance for what he did. Eddie is most deeply disturbed by the aftereffects of the violence on children, and so he spends much of his time working with younger kids in an effort to both keep them off the streets and to get support to those who need it - including a 16-year-old girl whose brother died in her arms. Soulful and empathic, Eddie, who learned to paint in prison, teaches art to children, trying to warn them of the debilitating trauma experienced by those touched by the violence. The Interrupters follows Ameena, Cobe and Eddie as they go about their work, and while doing so reveals their own inspired journeys of hope and redemption. The film attempts to make sense of what CeaseFire's Tio Hardiman calls, simply, ""the madness"".","sincere,captivating",1185.jpg,2011-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-interrupters/id505735063?uo=4,wS5Hjhy1RhM,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"
3440,The Invention of Lying,"From Ricky Gervais, the award-winning creator and star of the original BBC series ""The Office"" and HBO's ""Extras,"" comes a new romantic comedy. ""The Invention of Lying"" takes place in an alternate reality in which lying--even the concept of a lie--does not exist. Everyone--from politicians to advertisers to the man and woman on the street--speaks the truth and nothing but the truth with no thought of the consequences. But when a down-on-his-luck loser named Mark (Gervais) suddenly develops the ability to lie, he finds that dishonesty has its rewards. In a world where every word is assumed to be the absolute truth, Mark easily lies his way to fame and fortune. But lies have a way of spreading, and Mark begins to realize that things are getting a little out of control when some of his tallest tales are being taken as, well, gospel. With the entire world now hanging on his every word, there is only one thing Mark has not been able to lie his way into: the heart of the woman he loves.","The film features a narrative set in an alternative reality in which there is no such thing as lying and everything said is the absolute truth. In this world people make blunt, often cruel statements, including those that in our world people would normally keep to themselves. There is a lack of religious belief. The absence of fiction results in a movie industry limited to lecture-style historical readings and advertisements as bluntly truthful as the people are.
Mark Bellison (Ricky Gervais) is an unsuccessful lecture-film writer who is assigned to write about the 1300s, a ""very boring"" era. One night he goes out on a date with the beautiful, charming and wealthy Anna McDoogles (Jennifer Garner). She tells Mark she is not attracted to him, because of his looks and unsuccessful financial situation, but is going out with him to satisfy her extremely prejudiced mother and as a favour to Mark's friend Greg Kleinschmidt (Louis C.K.).
The next day Mark is fired from his job because of the lack of interest in his films, and his landlord evicts him for not paying his rent. Depressed, he goes to the bank to close his account. The teller informs him that the computers are down, and asks him how much money he has in his account. Mark is about to tell her when a strange reaction occurs in his brain, as he remembers how much money his landlord said he owed ($800). He has an epiphany that enables him to tell the world's first lie, to the effect that he has $800 in his account. The computer comes back online and shows his balance is $300 but the teller gives him the full $800 anyway, assuming that the computer has made a mistake.
Mark then lies in a variety of other circumstances, including telling an attractive woman that the world will end unless they have sex, preventing a police officer (Edward Norton in a cameo) from arresting his friend Greg for drunk driving, getting money from a casino, and stopping his neighbour Frank Fawcett (Jonah Hill) from committing suicide. He realises that lying can be used for better purposes that just for personal gain by doing this. He then writes a screenplay about the world being invaded by aliens in the 14th century, in which it is claimed that the memories of all humans were erased. He becomes wealthy from the success of the film which he names The Black Plague.
Mark convinces Anna to go out with him again, hoping she will see past his looks now that he is financially secure. On their date Anna congratulates Mark for his success and admits that he would be a good husband and father. She is still not attracted to him, saying that, if they ever have children, Mark would contribute half of the heredity to their children, resulting in ""fat kids with snub noses"". Mark then gets a call that his mother has had a heart attack and rushes to the hospital. There, the doctor (Jason Bateman) tells him that his mother is going to die. She is terrified of death, believing that it will bring an eternity of nothingness. Mark, through tears, tells her that death instead brings a joyful afterlife, introducing the concept of a Heaven to her, and she dies happy while the doctors and nurses appear awed by what he says.
Mark soon receives worldwide attention for his supposed new information about death. Under pressure from Anna, he tells them, through ""ten rules"", that he talks to a ""Man In The Sky"" who controls everything and promises great rewards in the good place after you die, as long as you do no more than three ""bad things"". Some time later Anna and Mark are together in a park and Anna asks him, if they marry, would his now being rich and famous make their children more physically attractive? Mark wants to lie but does not because of his feelings for Anna.
Meanwhile Mark's rival Brad Kessler (Rob Lowe) pursues Anna romantically, motivated by Mark's success. However, Brad's blunt, rude manner makes Anna uncomfortable, though she continues dating him; they become engaged. Anna invites Mark to the wedding. Mark tries to dissuade her from marrying Brad, but fails. Anna goes to the park she first went to with Mark and sees a slightly overweight child with an ice cream being bullied by thinner children. She yells at them and they run away. She runs up to the boy and wipes away his tears while asking his name. He replies 'Short Fat Brian' to which she tells him: 'You are so much more than just that.'
Before the wedding Mark's friend Greg shows up and tries to convince him that he has not missed his chance with Anna. Mark reluctantly attends Anna and Brad's wedding, where he objects to the marriage, but the officiant informs him that only the Man in the Sky can stop the wedding. Brad and Anna both ask Mark to ask the Man in the Sky what Anna should do but Mark refuses to say anything and leaves, wanting Anna to choose for herself. Anna walks out and Mark confesses his ability to lie and tells her that the Man In The Sky was made up. Anna struggles to comprehend the concept and asks why he did not lie to convince her to marry him; Mark states that it ""wouldn't count"". Anna confesses that she loves him.
Some time later, the now-pregnant Anna and Mark are shown married with a son, who, it is implied, has inherited his father's ability to lie.","white lie,replacement,liar,history filmmaking,anxiety,seduction,lie,playing god,end of the world,blind date,sexual arousal,life after death,heaven,theft,date,nothingness,tv commercial,anticipation,thief,cheating,belief in heaven,depression,diarrhea,cynical,drugs,family dinner,jealousy,hazing,religion,brain,loser,remote control,worrying,success,fired from the job,secret,sadness,hopelessness,lightbulb,belief in the afterlife,fiction,eternity,writing,misery,love triangle,alternate reality,self worth,church,love,death,idea,integrity,fear,belief in god,pain killer,joy,witty,happiness,ten commandments,friendship,lying,luck,truth,misinterpret,flash forward,offbeat,eyeglasses,atheist,screenwriter,truth,money,bank,fabrication,storytelling,atheism,humorous,make it up,anger,scriptwriter,writer,guess,dating,deception,assumption,apology,wealth,god,honesty,clever,invention",3440.jpg,2009-09-14, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-invention-of-lying/id336891382?uo=4,a-H2dNfx-Uw,,,Comedy
3817,The Invincible Iron Man,"Past and present collide in this epic adventure that reveals the origin of Iron Man. While raising the ruins of a long buried Chinese kingdom, billionaire inventor Tony Stark digs up far more than he bargained for. He unleashes an age-old prophecy that foretells the resurrection of the Mandarin, the emperor of China's darkest and most violent dynasty. In order to confront the destructive force, Tony creates an armored suit infused with high-tech weaponry. To stop the evil that he himself has raised form the earth, Tony must become his greatest invention ever - Iron Man! The newly born champion must travel to the four corners of the earth to battle the Mandarin's henchmen, the Elementals - four magical warriors who harness the power of the elements - earth, water, wind, and fire - with deadly chemistry. But is the Iron Knight, as he his known in the prophecy, strong enough to defy fate and turn back the malevolent forces hell-bent on earth's destruction?","While attempting to unearth an ancient Chinese city using his company's resources - while also diverting money into a project that will put Stark Enterprises on the cutting edge of technology - Tony Stark's ambitions are thwarted when the Jade Dragons attack the excavation site, killing almost everyone and kidnapping his friend James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes. Traveling to the site to investigate, Tony is captured and injured by the Jade Dragons, his life saved by a Chinese shaman and Rhodes' skills as an army medic after a piece of shrapnel damages his heart.
The shaman tells Tony that the Dragons seek to prevent the return of the Mandarin, an evil ruler of great power who ruled China three thousand years ago, and who the city commemorates. Should four rings created by the Mandarin - their purpose being to grant him power over death - be brought together after the city rises, the Mandarin will awaken. The Dragons force Tony to construct, within a week, a weapon to sink the city or he will face execution. To show they are serious they kill the shaman. Befriending Li Mei, a member of the group, Tony learns that she has a duty that has been passed down her family from father to son - she had no brothers - but she will not reveal what it is. Meanwhile, four elemental spirits are released when the city is raised, and they find two of the Mandarin's four rings.
When the weapon that Stark and Rhodes created is revealed to be a fake, the Dragons leader is about to shoot Rhodes, but Li Mei shoots the leader from behind. Tony subsequently emerges in their true project; a suit of armor. Rescuing Rhodes, Tony flees the temple and return home, but Li Mei refuses his offer to take her with him. Studying a painting of the prophecy, Li Mei realizes that Tony is the 'Iron Knight' who it was foretold would battle the Mandarin, but this brings her no comfort, as the prophecy only states that one of the two shall die without specifying who. To spare Tony this fate, she leads the Jade Dragons in attempting to destroy the city, but the rest of the Dragons are killed and she is confronted by a shadowy dragon-like creature.
After returning to America, Tony and Rhodes are shocked to discover that they are wanted by S.H.I.E.L.D. for selling weapons to the Jade Dragons; Howard Stark, Tony's father, sent Rhodes weapons to provide enhanced security for the site against Tony's wishes, and, with the Dragons having stolen the shipment, he has apparently used Tony as a scapegoat to maintain his position.
Having escaped the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and sneaked into his office with the aid of his secretary Virginia ""Pepper"" Potts, Tony reveals his secret project to Rhodes; multiple suits of armor, each one designed for tasks that human beings could not possibly accomplish alone. Taking an underwater suit of armor to the third temple at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean (the temples' locations provided on a map from the shaman) - Tony manages to defeat the Fire Elemental by throwing it into the water, but the other three escape with the ring.
Following a brief confrontation with his father over Howard framing Tony for arms dealing (during which it is revealed that the two men have long been at odds over their opinion regarding weapons, a division that has only worsened since the death of Tony's mother), Tony dons another armor and flies to recover the last ring, located in an active volcano, Pepper and Rhodes allowing themselves to be arrested to buy Tony time. Although he defeats the Air and Water Elementals - he tricks the Water Elemental into freezing the Air Elemental before throwing the Water Elemental into the molten lava - and escapes with the ring, Tony's armor is badly damaged by the Earth Elemental's assault, forcing him to abandon the armor and make his own way home.
Having returned to New York, Tony is confronted by Li Mei, who begs him to give her the ring to prevent the Earth Elemental from attacking Tony. Deciding to try and destroy the temple, but unable to reach his more advanced armors due to the S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel in the building, Tony and Li Mei return to China using the armor Tony developed while being held prisoner, which remains on the plane he and Rhodes used to return home.
Arriving at the city just as the Earth Elemental raises an army from the ground, Tony clashes with the Elemental, destroying his adversary with a final desperate mid-air collision. However, as he prepares to search for the last Ring, Li Mei reveals that her bracelet is the final ring; her family seeks to ensure the resurrection of the Mandarin rather than his defeat, and, as the last descendant of the Mandarin, only Li Mei can hold the Mandarin's spirit, and only she can become the vessel he will need to walk the Earth again. Admitting that she was the one who gave S.H.I.E.L.D. the documents incriminating Tony for arms dealing in an attempt to protect him, Li Mei begs Tony to leave while he still can, but when he refuses, the army activates, forcing Tony to fight the soldiers as Li Mei advances towards the Mandarin's tomb.
Although Tony vanquishes the soldiers, he is subsequently forced to fight a vast dragon as Li Mei makes contact with the Mandarin's spirit. Despite his damaged armour, Tony manages to defeat the dragon by forcing a vat of liquid metal to expand and solidify inside it, but when he enters the temple, he finds Li Mei under the control of the Mandarin. As his armor is torn even further apart by the assault, Tony begs Li Mei to remember who she is, managing to convince Li Mei to turn against the Mandarin. As she removes the rings from her hand, the Mandarin's connection to the real world is broken, triggering a brief explosion before his spirit vanishes,but with his last breath, he unleashes an energy which blasts Li Mei. After thanking Tony for saving her with a kiss, Li Mei dies in his arms, leaving Tony alone in the temple to mourn her death.
Returning to the U.S, Tony is cleared of all charges by the Chinese government and S.H.I.E.L.D., subsequently buying up all available shares in Stark Enterprises, bringing the company under his complete control. However, he has only two actions to take: promoting Rhodes to the position of Chief Engineer for Advanced Technologies, and handing control of the company over to his father. Saying that he's always regarded the company as a father/son enterprise, Howard and Tony shake hands, Howard subsequently firing the board of directors to free him and Tony from the bureaucracy that nearly tore them apart.",,3817.jpg,2007-01-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-invincible-iron-man/id281523000?uo=4,,,,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
232,The Iron Giant,"Something humongous is among us! government agent wants to destroy. 
He rescues a huge robot which has rocketed to earth from space - and tries to protect the genial giant from a nosy government agent and the military. 
This is the story of a nine-year-old boy named Hogarth Hughes who makes friends with an innocent alien giant robot that came from outer space. Meanwhile, a paranoid U.S. Government agent named Kent Mansley arrives in town, determined to destroy the giant at all costs.

","In 1957, a large alien robot crashes from orbit near the coast of Rockwell, Maine with no memory. Shortly after, the Iron Giant wanders off into the mainland. Nine-year-old Hogarth Hughes follows a trail of the forest's destruction and frees the robot, who is stuck in the power cables of an electrical substation. After being rescued by and befriended by Hogarth, the Giant follows him back to his house, where he lives with his widowed mother Annie. Upon their return, the robot attempts to eat the iron off the nearby railroad tracks. Alarmed at the sound of an incoming train, Hogarth tells the giant to repair the tracks. The robot attempts this, but takes too long, causing the train to collide with his head. Hogarth hides the damaged robot in their barn where he discovers the robot is self repairing.
Later that night, Hogarth returns to the barn with a stack of comic books to read to the Giant. The robot is impressed with Superman, but distressed when he discovers a comic about an evil robot; Hogarth tells the robot that it can be who he chooses to be. Investigating the destroyed substation, U.S. government agent Kent Mansley discovers evidence of the robot and decides to continue his inquiries in nearby Rockwell. Finding a BB gun Hogarth left near the substation the night he found the Giant, Mansley takes up a room for rent at Hogarth's home and trails the boy to learn more. He is paranoid about an alien invasion and alerts the U.S. Army to the possible presence of the robot. Worried that they will get caught, Hogarth evades Mansley and takes the robot to beatnik artist Dean McCoppin who passes off the robot as one of his works of art when Mansley and Lieutenant General Rogard investigate. Hogarth pretends to attack the robot with a toy gun, and inadvertently causes the robot to activate a weapons system in retaliation. Dean saves Hogarth; they command the robot to leave, but soon realize that it cannot control its self-defense reaction. They chase after it before reaching town.
In Rockwell, the robot saves two boys, but Mansley, having seen it, orders an attack to stop it. The robot flees with Hogarth until he is shot down by a missile fired from an F-86. After crash landing, the robot believes Hogarth to be dead; enraged, it activates its weapons and attacks the Army, who are no match for the advanced firepower. Mansley lies to Rogard that the robot killed Hogarth, before telling him to lure the robot out to sea so they can destroy it with a nuclear ballistic missile from the USS Nautilus. Hogarth (alive the whole time) wakes up and calms the robot down, causing it to deactivate its weapons. Dean tells Rogard and his men to stand down. Rogard, realizing that Mansley lied to him, is about to tell the Nautilus to stand down, but Mansley snatches the walkie-talkie and orders the Nautilus to launch the missile. Realizing the deadly mistake, Rogard lambastes Mansley and informs him that not only the robot, but everyone in Rockwell, will be destroyed when the missile hits. Mansley tries to escape Rockwell in order to save himself, but the robot stops him and he is arrested by the Army. When Hogarth tells the robot about Rockwell's fate, the robot flies off to intercept the missile, as a hero, not a weapon. The robot and missile seem to collide, causing a massive explosion high up in the atmosphere. The people of the town recognize the giant as a hero, but everyone, especially Hogarth, is deeply saddened by the robot's sacrifice.
Some time later, Annie and Dean have a romantic relationship and Dean has created a statue honoring the robot. Hogarth receives a package from Rogard, containing the only piece of the robot they found, a small jaw bolt. That night, Hogarth awakens to a familiar beeping coming from the bolt, which is trying to get out his window. He knows the robot is repairing itself somewhere and he opens it to let the bolt out. On the Langj‚àö‚àÇkull glacier in Iceland various parts of the robot approach the snowdrift where the head rests, eyes glowing, as the robot wakes up and smiles.","exciting,sentimental,suspenseful,joy,touching,humorous,feel good,bittersweet",232.jpg,1999-07-31, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-iron-giant/id284447916?uo=4,OTnu-cGP17w,,,"Animation,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
667,The Iron Lady,"An elderly Margaret Thatcher talks to the imagined presence of her recently deceased husband as she struggles to come to terms with his death while scenes from her past life, from girlhood to British prime minister, intervene.
Aa virtual prisoner in her own home due to her concerned staff and daughter Carol, Margaret Thatcher, Britain's first woman prime minister, looks back on her life as she clears out her late husband Denis's clothes for the Oxfam shop. Denis is seen as being her rock as she first enters parliament and then runs for the leadership of the Conservative Party, culminating in her eventual premiereship. Now his ghost joins her to comment on her successes and failures, sometimes to her annoyance, generally to her comfort until ultimately, as the clothes are sent to the charity shop, Denis departs from Margret's life forever.
The Iron Lady is a surprising and intimate portrait of Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep), the first and only female Prime Minister of The United Kingdom. One of the 20th century's most famous and influential women, Thatcher came from nowhere to smash through barriers of gender and class to be heard in a male dominated world.

","The film begins circa 2008 (opening against the backdrop of news of the Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing) with an elderly Lady Thatcher buying milk unrecognized by other customers and walking back from the shop alone. Over the course of three days we see her struggle with dementia and with the lack of power that comes with old age, while looking back on defining moments of her personal and professional life, on which she reminisces with her (now dead) husband, Denis Thatcher. She is shown as having difficulty distinguishing between the past and present. A theme throughout the film is the personal price that Thatcher has paid for power. Denis is portrayed as somewhat ambivalent about his wife's rise to power, her son Mark lives in South Africa and is shown as having little contact with his mother, and it is implied that Thatcher's relationship with her daughter Carol is at times strained.
In flashback we are shown Thatcher's youth, working in the family grocery store in Grantham, listening to the political speeches of her father, whom she idolised - it is also hinted that she had a poor relationship with her mother, a housewife - and announcing that she has won a place at the University of Oxford. She remembers her struggle, as a young lower-middle class woman, to break into a snobbish male-dominated Tory party and find a seat in the House of Commons, along with businessman Denis Thatcher's marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a ""Lady Member"" of the House, and as Education Secretary in Edward Heath's cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with Airey Neave (later assassinated by the Irish National Liberation Army), her decision to stand for Leader of the Conservative Party, and her voice coaching and image change.
Further flashbacks examine historical events during her time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget (over the misgivings of ""wet"" members of her Cabinet ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Ian Gilmour, Francis Pym, Michael Heseltine and Jim Prior), the Brixton Riots of 1981, the miners' strike of 1984‚Äö√Ñ√¨5, and the bombing of the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Conservative Party Conference, when she and Denis were almost killed. We also see (slightly out of chronological sequence) her decision to retake the Falkland Islands following the islands' invasion by Argentina in 1982, the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano and Britain's subsequent victory in the Falklands War, her friendship with Ronald Reagan and emergence as a world figure, and the economic boom of the late 1980s.
By 1990 Thatcher is shown as an imperious but aging figure, ranting aggressively at her Cabinet, refusing to accept that the Community Charge (the ""Poll Tax"") is regarded as unjust, and fiercely opposed to European Integration. Her deputy Geoffrey Howe resigns after being humiliated by her in a Cabinet meeting, Michael Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership and her loss of support from her Cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but to resign as Prime Minister, about which she is shown as still disheartened about twenty years later.
Eventually, Thatcher is shown packing up her late husband's belongings, and telling him it's time for him to go. Denis's ghost leaves her fully dressed but without his shoes - in spite of her cries that she is not yet ready to lose him, and she is left alone washing up a teacup.","thought provoking,stylized,sincere,touching",667.jpg,2011-12-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-iron-lady/id496291011?uo=4,cSiXVVdw0Yc,,,"Art House & International,Drama"

 Adrien Brody, Keira Knightley, Daniel Craig","After miraculously recovering from a bullet wound to the head, Gulf War veteran Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) returns to Vermont in 1992, suffering from periods of amnesia. While walking, he sees a young girl, Jackie (Laura Marano), and her alcoholic mother (Kelly Lynch) in despair beside their broken-down truck. Starks and Jackie quickly form a certain affinity; she asks him to give her his dogtags and he does so. He gets the truck started for them and continues on his way. Shortly after, a man driving along the same highway gives Jack a ride and they get pulled over by a policeman. The scene changes: Starks is found lying on the deserted roadside near the dead policeman, with a slug from the policeman's gun in his body. The murder weapon is on the ground nearby. Although he testifies there was someone else at the scene, he is not believed because of his amnesia. Starks is found not guilty by reason of insanity and is incarcerated in a mental institution.
Starks is placed in the care of Dr. Thomas Becker (Kris Kristofferson), a psychiatrist, and his staff. In December 1992 Starks is forced to undergo an unauthorized treatment designed by Becker: he is injected with experimental drugs, bound in a straitjacket and then placed inside a morgue drawer as a form of sensory deprivation. While in this condition, he is somehow able to travel 15 years into the future and stay there for a short time. He meets an older version of Jackie (Keira Knightley) at a roadside diner where she works. He suspects this happens because it is the only memory he can ever fully hold on to. Seeing him standing forlornly, she takes pity on him and offers him shelter, just for the night. While in her apartment, Starks comes across his own dogtags and confronts her. Jackie tells him that Jack Starks died on New Year's Day in 1993, and so he cannot possibly be who he says he is. She becomes upset and asks him to leave. Subsequently, Starks is transported back to the future on several occasions in the course of his treatment and, after earning Jackie's trust, they try to figure out how to make use of the time-travelling so as to remove Jack from the hospital and save his life.
Early on 1 January 1993, knowing his time is fast running out, Starks slips out of the hospital and travels to the home of Jackie and her mother. He gives the mother a letter he has written, which outlines Jackie's bleak future and warns the mother that she is fated to orphan Jackie when she falls asleep with a cigarette and is burned to death. When he returns to the hospital, Starks slips on ice and hits his head; bleeding profusely, he convinces two of the more sympathetic doctors to put him into the jacket one last time.
Starks returns to 2007, where he finds that his letter has made all the difference. Jackie now has a better life than in the previous version of 2007 - no longer a waitress, she's dressed in a nurse's uniform and has a noticeably more cheerful outlook. They reprise their first 2007 meeting: she sees Starks standing in the snow and initially drives past him, but backs up when she notices his head wound. She stops and offers to take him to the hospital where she works. While they are in the car, Jackie receives a call from her mother ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ still alive and well. They drive on, the screen fades to white, and a voice-over reveals that the link to the ""previous"" future is not lost when Jackie says ""How much time do we have?"", a question she has asked him before. As the credits start to roll, the answer to the question is given by the words of the song: ""We have all the time in the world"".","mind bending,stylized,bleak,atmospheric,offbeat",2072.jpg,2005-01-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-jacket/id408240955?uo=4,rCxQ83Pg1Ko,,,"Drama,Horror,Mystery & Suspense"
897,The Karate Kid,"A fatherless teenager faces his moment of truth in THE KARATE KID. Daniel (Ralph Macchio) arrives in Los Angeles from the east coast and faces the difficult task of making new friends. However, he becomes the object of bullying by the Cobras, a menacing gang of karate students, when he strikes up a relationship with Ali (Elisabeth Shue), the Cobra leader's ex-girlfriend. Eager to fight back and impress his new girlfriend but afraid to confront the dangerous gang, Daniel asks his handyman Miyagi (Noriyuki 'Pat' Morita), whom he learns is a master of the martial arts, to teach him karate. Miyagi teaches Daniel that karate is a mastery over the self, mind, and body and that fighting is always the last answer to a problem. Under Miyagi's guidance, Daniel develops not only physical skills but also the faith and self-confidence to compete despite tremendous odds as he encounters the fight of his life in the exciting finale to this entertaining film.","Daniel LaRusso (Ralph Macchio), a high school senior, moves with his mother (Randee Heller) from Newark, New Jersey to Reseda, a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. Their apartment's handyman is an eccentric but kindly and humble Okinawan immigrant named Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki ""Pat"" Morita).
Daniel befriends Ali Mills (Elisabeth Shue), an attractive high school cheerleader, at the same time angering her arrogant ex-boyfriend, Johnny Lawrence (William Zabka). Johnny is the best student at the Cobra Kai dojo, where he is taught an unethical, vicious form of martial arts. Daniel knows a little karate from books and a few classes at the YMCA, but Johnny easily defeats him in their first encounter. Thereafter, Johnny and his gang of Cobra Kai students torment Daniel at every opportunity.
When Mr. Miyagi sees the gang giving Daniel a savage beating, he intervenes and single-handedly defeats five attackers with ease. Awed, Daniel asks Mr. Miyagi to be his teacher. Mr. Miyagi refuses, but agrees to go with Daniel to the Cobra Kai dojo in order to resolve the conflict. They meet with the sensei, John Kreese (Martin Kove), an ex-Special Forces Vietnam Veteran who sneers at the concepts of mercy and restraint. Kreese and Mr. Miyagi agree to a match between Johnny and Daniel in two months' time at the ""All Valley Karate Tournament,"" where the Cobra Kai students can fight Daniel on equal terms. Mr. Miyagi also requests that the bullying stop while Daniel trains. Kreese orders his students to leave Daniel alone, but under the condition that if Daniel does not show up for the tournament, the harassment will resume and Miyagi himself will also become a target.
Mr. Miyagi becomes Daniel's teacher and, slowly, a surrogate father figure. He begins Daniel's training by having him perform menial tasks such as waxing cars, sanding a wooden floor, and painting a fence and Mr. Miyagi's house. Each chore is accompanied with specific movements involving clockwise/counter-clockwise and up-and-down hand motions. Daniel fails to see any connection to his training and these chores and eventually feels frustrated, believing he has learned nothing of karate. When he expresses his frustration, Mr. Miyagi shows how while doing these chores Daniel has been learning defensive blocks through muscle memory.
As Daniel's training continues more overtly, his bond with Mr. Miyagi becomes closer. He learns that Mr. Miyagi lost his wife and son in childbirth at Manzanar internment camp while he was serving overseas with the United States Army during World War II. The loss of his family and Daniel's loss of his father further strengthen the father-son surrogacy. Daniel also discovers that the outwardly peaceful and serene Miyagi received the Medal of Honor for valor against German forces in Europe. Through Mr. Miyagi's teaching, Daniel learns not only karate but also important life lessons such as the importance of personal balance, reflected in the belief that martial arts training is as much about training the spirit as the body. Daniel applies the life lessons that Mr. Miyagi has taught him to strengthen his relationship with Ali.
At the tournament, Daniel surprises everyone by reaching the semi-finals. Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against a highly skilled opponent. Kreese instructs Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to disable Daniel with an illegal attack to the knee. Bobby reluctantly does so, severely injuring Daniel and getting disqualified in the process. As Daniel writhes in pain on the ground, Bobby profusely apologizes before he is pulled away. Daniel is taken to the locker room and checked out, with the physician determining that he cannot continue. Although Mr. Miyagi assures him he has already proven himself, Daniel believes that if he does not continue, his tormentors will have gotten the best of him. He gets Miyagi to use a pain suppression technique to allow him to finish the tournament. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Daniel hobbles into the ring. The championship final is a seesaw battle, as neither Johnny nor Daniel is able to break through the other's defenses.
Daniel successfully uses a scissor leg technique, tripping Johnny and delivering a blow to the back of the head, giving Johnny a nose bleed. The match is paused for Johnny to be looked at by Kreese. Kreese directs Johnny to sweep Daniel's injured leg, an unethical move. Johnny looks horrified at the order but reluctantly agrees after Kreese's intimidation. Despite the moves, Daniel gets up each time.
Eventually, Daniel and Johnny are tied, with the next point deciding victory. Daniel tries to kick Johnny with his injured leg but Johnny grabs it and delivers illegal contact to Daniel's injured knee. Daniel, barely able to stand, assumes the ""Crane"" stance, a technique he observed Mr. Miyagi performing on the beach during his training. After the referee signals to begin, Johnny lunges in. Daniel jumps in the air and delivers a front kick to Johnny's chin, winning the tournament.
Johnny, having gained newfound respect for his adversary, takes Daniel's trophy from the Master of Ceremonies and presents it to Daniel himself, sincerely proclaiming ""You're all right, LaRusso! Good match!"" Mr. Miyagi, Ali, and Daniel's mother look on admiringly as Daniel celebrates his victory.","feel good,sentimental,captivating,uplifting,touching",897.jpg,1984-06-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-karate-kid/id270980948?uo=4,FOUGf_s4hy4,,,"Drama,Kids & Family"

522,The Killing,"Crooks plan and execute a daring racetrack robbery. With fascinating detail, Stanley Kubrick lays bare the intricate inner-planning of a racetrack heist by a deadly mastermind (Sterling Hayden) and his crew.  
After getting out of prison, Johnny Clay masterminds a complex race-track heist, but his scheme is complicated by the intervention of the wife of a teller (George Peatty) in on the scheme, the boyfriend of the wife, airport regulations, and a small dog.

","Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to rob two million dollars from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to give access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer).
George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he made her at the time of their marriage, and George hopes that telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, she enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates.
The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying.
Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly), and he and Fay go to the airport. At the airport however, they are told that they aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead have to check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane, they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart, breaks open and the loose banknotes are swept away by the wind. They leave the airport but are unsuccessful at finding a cab. Fay urges Johnny to flee but he refuses, stating that there is no use trying to escape. The film ends with two officers coming to arrest him.","stylized,clever,suspenseful,atmospheric,tense",522.jpg,1956-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-killing/id281010640?uo=4,FiDUFG56wT4,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

7314,The King's Speech,"The story of King George VI of Britain, his impromptu ascension to the throne and the speech therapist who helped the unsure monarch become worthy of it.
Tells the story of the man who became King George VI, the father of Queen Elizabeth II. After his brother abdicates, George ('Bertie') reluctantly assumes the throne. Plagued by a dreaded stammer and considered unfit to be king, Bertie engages the help of an unorthodox speech therapist named Lionel Logue. Through a set of unexpected techniques, and as a result of an unlikely friendship, Bertie is able to find his voice and boldly lead the country through war.

","Prince Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth), the second son of King George V, stammers through his speech closing the 1925 British Empire Exhibition at Wembley Stadium. The Duke has given up hope of a cure, but his wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) persuades him to see Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian speech therapist in London. During their first session, Logue breaches royal etiquette and insists on calling his patient ""Bertie,"" a name used only within the Duke's family. When Albert decides Logue's methods and manner are unsuitable, the Australian bets a shilling that the Duke can recite Hamlet's ""To be, or not to be"" soliloquy without trouble while listening to The Marriage of Figaro played out loud on headphones. Logue records his performance on a gramophone record; convinced he has stammered throughout, Albert leaves in a huff, declaring his condition ""hopeless"" and dismissing Logue. Logue offers him the recording as a keepsake.


1934 photograph of George V delivering the Royal Christmas Message; an image recreated in the film
After King George V (Michael Gambon) makes his 1934 Christmas radio address, he explains to Albert the importance of broadcasting to a modern monarchy. He declares that ""David"" (Edward, Prince of Wales, played by Guy Pearce), Albert's older brother, will bring ruin to himself, the family, and the country when he accedes to the throne, leaving Chancellor Hitler and Premier Stalin to sort out matters in Europe. King George demands that Albert train himself, starting with a reading of his father's speech. He makes an agonising attempt to do so.
Later, Albert plays Logue's recording and hears himself unhesitatingly reciting Shakespeare. He returns to Logue, but he and his wife insist that Logue stop delving into his private life and merely work on the physical aspects. Logue teaches his patient muscle relaxation and breath control techniques, but continues to probe gently at the psychological roots of the stutter. The Duke eventually reveals some of the pressures of his childhood: his tense relationship with his unloving and strict father, the repression of his natural left-handedness, painful childhood metal splints to correct his knock-knees, long term physical abuse by his nanny, and the early death of his beloved epileptic younger brother, John. The two men become friends.
In January 1936, George V dies, and David ascends the throne as King Edward VIII, but causes a monumental crisis with his determination to marry Mrs Wallis Simpson (Eve Best), an American socialite who is still legally married to her second husband. At Christmas in Balmoral Castle, Albert points out that Edward, as head of the Church of England, cannot marry Mrs Simpson, even if she receives a divorce; Edward accuses his brother of wanting to usurp his place, citing his elocution lessons as preparation, and resurrects his childhood taunt of ""B-B-B-Bertie"".


Firth and Bonham Carter as the Duke and Duchess of York
At his next session, Albert expresses his frustration that his speech has improved while talking to most people‚Äö√Ñ√Æexcept his own brother. Albert reveals the extent of Edward VIII's folly with Mrs Simpson. When Logue insists that Albert could be a good king instead of his brother, the latter labels such a suggestion as treason, mocks Logue's failed acting aspirations and humble origins, and dismisses him. When King Edward VIII abdicates to marry Mrs Simpson, Albert becomes King George VI. The new King and Queen visit Logue at his home to apologise, startling Logue's wife (who had been kept in the dark about the patient's identity).
During preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey, George VI learns that Logue has no formal qualifications. Logue explains that, as an elocution teacher, he was asked to help shell-shocked Australian soldiers returning from the First World War, and thereby found his calling. When George VI remains unconvinced of his unfitness to be king, Logue sits in King Edward's Chair and dismisses the underlying Stone of Scone as a trifle. Goaded by Logue's seeming disrespect, the King surprises himself with his own sudden outraged eloquence.
Upon the declaration of war with Nazi Germany in September 1939, George VI summons Logue to Buckingham Palace to prepare for his upcoming radio address to millions of listeners in Britain and the Empire. The King is left alone with Logue in the room with the microphone. He delivers his speech competently, as if to Logue alone, who guides him silently throughout. By the end of his speech, George VI is speaking freely with little to no guidance from Logue. Afterwards, the King and his family step onto the balcony of the palace to be viewed and applauded by the thousands who have gathered.
A title card explains that Logue was always present at King George VI's speeches during the war, and that they remained friends for the rest of their lives.","queen,duke of windsor,f word,flow,top hat,london england,king,inspiration,stammering,archbishop of canterbury,doctor patient relationship,family relationships,protocol,unlikely friendship,male bonding,radio broadcast,underdog,speech therapy,husband wife relationship,brother brother relationship,practicing a speech,stutter,monarchy,speech,australian,microphone,phonograph,christmas tree,british royal family,stuttering,on air,speech,mother son relationship,death,montage,prime minister,priggishness,projection,abdication,prince,england,disability,live broadcast,speech therapist,corgi,mother daughter relationship,decorum,king george vi,1930s,speech impediment,pronounciation,empowerment,father son relationship,radio,go for it,britain,year 1939,therapist client relationship,eccentric,scenario which perverts facts,death of king,father daughter relationship,marriage,confidence,house of windsor,compassion,royalty,cigarette smoking,bromance,self confidence,stutter,cigar smoking,radio speech,voice recording,year 1934,declaration of war",7314.jpg,2011-01-07,,pzI4D6dyp_o,,,Drama
2163,The Kingdom,"Oscar winners Jamie Foxx (Collateral) and Chris Cooper (Breach) and Golden Globe winners Jennifer Garner (Daredevil) and Jason Bateman (Smokin' Aces) ignite the screen in this high-intensity thriller about a team of elite FBI agents sent to Saudi Arabia to solve a brutal mass murder and find a killer before he strikes again. Out of their element and under heavy fire, the team must join forces with their Saudi counterparts. As these unlikely allies begin to unlock the secrets of the crime scene, the team is led into a heart-stopping, do-or-die confrontation.","The opening scene of the film explains the origins of U.S.-Saudi diplomatic relations and how the discovery of energy resources has transformed the Middle East through a timeline sequence. It portrays the conflicts that have risen since the late 1940s for the rightful ownership of the oil industry. This includes the Persian Gulf War in Iraq and al-Qaeda's growing network of terrorism. Eventually, it explains the 9/11 terrorist attacks and how the majority of the hijackers were Saudis. This raises serious questions on the relationship between Saudi Arabia and the United States. The plot begins with the current struggle of Saudi Arabia and the kingdom's efforts to stand control of their country against terrorist extremists.
During a softball game at an American oil company housing compound in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, al-Qaeda terrorists set off a bomb, killing many Americans and Saudis in the process. The terrorists impersonate members of the Saudi State Police. While one team hijacks a car and shoots at the residents of the area, another runs out onto the softball diamond, pretending to aid the Americans, but then reveals that he is a suicide bomber and blows himself up, killing everyone near him. Sergeant Haytham (Ali Suliman) of the Saudi state police, disables the stolen Saudi Police vehicle and kills the terrorists. A short time later, the FBI Legal Attach‚àö¬© in Saudi Arabia, Special Agent Francis Manner (Kyle Chandler), calls up his colleague Special Agent Ronald Fleury (Jamie Foxx) to tell him about the attack. Shortly afterwards, a second bomb explodes in the compound killing Manner and more people.
At FBI Headquarters in Washington, D.C., Fleury briefs his rapid deployment team on the attack and casualties. During the briefing, Special Agent Janet Mayes (Jennifer Garner), a forensic examiner, breaks down in tears upon hearing of Francis' death. Fleury whispers something into her ear which causes her to control her emotions. While the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. State Department hinder FBI efforts to investigate the attack, Fleury blackmails the Saudi ambassador into allowing an FBI investigative team into Saudi Arabia. Departing from Andrews Air Force Base, Fleury and his team of Mayes, Adam Leavitt (Jason Bateman), an intelligence analyst and Special Agent Grant Sykes (Chris Cooper), a bomb technician, go to Saudi Arabia. Arriving at Prince Sultan Air Base, they are met by Colonel Faris al-Ghazi (Ashraf Barhom), the commander of the Saudi State Police Force providing security at the compound. Fleury soon realizes that Colonel al-Ghazi is not in charge of running the investigation. In actuality, the investigation is being run by General Al Abdulmalik (Mahmoud Said) of the Saudi National Guard, who does not give Fleury and his team permission to investigate. Rather, they are to observe the Saudi investigation.
When the FBI team is invited to the palace of Saudi Prince Ahmed bin Khaled (Omar Berdouni) for a dinner, Mayes is excluded because of her sex. While at the palace, Fleury persuades the Prince that Colonel al-Ghazi is a natural detective and should be allowed to lead the investigation. With this new change in leadership, the Americans are allowed a more hands-on approach to the crime scene. While searching for evidence, Sergeant Haytham and Sykes discover that the second bomb was detonated in an ambulance, using marbles as projectiles. Fleury learns that the brother of one of the dead terrorists had access to ambulances and police uniforms. Colonel al-Ghazi orders a SWAT team to raid the house, managing to kill a few heavily armed terrorists. Following the raid, the team discovers valuable intelligence, including multiple photos of the U.S. and other Western embassies in Riyadh. Soon afterwards, Fleury and his team are notified by the U.S. Embassy Deputy Chief of Mission Damon Schmidt (Jeremy Piven) that they have been ordered to return to the United States. However, Fleury and al-Ghazi both believed that the men that they had just killed were just amateur fighters and were not the real planners behind the attacks.
On their way to King Khalid International Airport, Fleury notices a youth watching their convoy from an overpass, and then looks behind him and notices the last of 4 black Chevy SUVS in their convoy has slowed down, falling far behind. He then notices a speeding car coming towards them and grabs the wheel from Sergeant Haytham, which allows them to partially evade the collision that occurs when the speeding car runs into the first SUV of their convoy, setting off a trunk full of explosives. Their SUV, the third one in their convoy, hits the first SUV, killing the men inside. The fourth SUV finally drives up and the men inside pull out Leavitt, throwing him into the back and driving away while a second car drives by to shoot the surviving Americans. Fleury manages to wound one attacker, and al-Ghazi commandeers a civilian vehicle to chase the fourth SUV and the other car into the dangerous Al-Suwaidi neighborhood of Riyadh. As they pull up, a gunman launches rocket-propelled grenades at them and a fierce firefight starts. Inside the complex, Leavitt is tied up and gagged while his attackers prepare to film a tape of them executing him by beheading.
After having killed their attackers, al-Ghazi decides that three of them must enter and find Leavitt and two must stay behind and cover the entrance. While Sykes and Haytham watch the entrance, al-Ghazi, Fleury and Mayes enter the building, following a blood trail and manage to finish off many other gunmen inside. Mayes, separate from the other two, scares a little girl in an apartment, and she enters to find a family with little children, their mother and grandfather. She yells at them to stay put and goes across the hall to another apartment to find Leavitt and his attackers. She kills the remaining insurgents, and al-Ghazi and the team start to leave. However, Mayes feels unsettled about the little girl, and walks in to give the girl a lollipop. In return, the girl gives her a marble, matching the ones pieced together earlier from the bomb scene. Fleury then realises that there is a trail of blood leading to the back of the apartment, and al-Ghazi sees the grandfather, suspects something and asks to help him up in order to inspect his hand. When the old man gives him his hand, al-Ghazi sees that the man is missing the fingers that Abu Hamza al-Masri[3] is missing in the terrorist group's many videos and confirms his idea that the grandfather is the terrorist leader. Abu Hamza's teenage grandson walks out of the bedroom and manages to shoot al-Ghazi in the neck twice with a pistol before it jams, then he begins to point his gun at Mayes, prompting Fleury to kill him. Abu Hamza then feebly pulls out an assault rifle and Haytham puts three shots in his chest. As Abu Hamza dies, another grandson hugs him and Abu Hamza whispers something into his ear to calm the child down. Al-Ghazi dies in Fleury's arms.
At Al-Ghazi's house, Fleury and Haytham meet his family. Fleury tells his son that al-Ghazi was his good friend, mirroring a similar scene earlier in the movie where he comforted Special Agent Manner's son. Fleury and his team return to the U.S., where they are commended by FBI Director James Grace (Richard Jenkins) for their outstanding work. Afterwards, Leavitt asks Fleury what he had whispered to Mayes (earlier in the film) to calm her down. The scene cuts to Abu Hamza's daughter asking her own son what his grandfather whispered to him as he was dying. Fleury recalls saying, ""We're gonna kill them all,"" while the grandson tells her mother, ""Don't fear them, my child. We are going to kill them all."", implying a never-ending, vicious cycle resulted from the war.","exploding body,rocket propelled grenade,shootout,george bush,loss of wife,bomb making,explosion,government agent,bullet hole,arab,assault rifle,ronald reagan,severed finger,interrogation,attempted murder,sheikh,mass killing,stabbed in the crotch,iraq war,saudi arabia,shooting baskets,shrapnel,mohammed,fbi agent,prince,u.s. attorney general,camel,kidnapping,flash bang,falcon,shot through a wall,washington d.c.,machine gun,police officer killed,speaking arabic,violence,royalty,usa,hand grenade,gymnasium,suspenseful,praying,bound and gagged,political manipulation,rpg,theocracy,compound,car wreck,federal bureau of investigation,saddam hussein,factionalism,oil,gun,political correctness,shot in the neck,revenge,basketball,safe room,investigation,convoy,islam,suicide bomber,attempted coverup,rough,hostage,uniform,fingerprints,exciting,torture,prayer,black american hero,rocket launcher,scapegoat,al qaeda,palace,george s. patton,pistol,urban combat,suv,ambassador,chase,flack vest,evil arab,ambush,general westmoreland,witness,terrorism,bloody body of a child,fish out of water,richard nixon,beheading,osama bin laden,war on terrorism,blood,fbi,grenade,overturning car,deception,impersonating a police officer,evidence",2163.jpg,2007-08-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-kingdom/id276439134?uo=4,T7xGu-SnWUk,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

1241,The Lake House,"A lonely doctor (Sandra Bullock) who once occupied an unusual lakeside home begins exchanging love letters with its newest resident, a frustrated architect (Keanu Reeves). When they discover that they're actually living two years apart, they must try to unravel the mystery behind their extraordinary romance before it's too late.","In 2006, Dr. Kate Forster is leaving a lake house that she has been renting in suburban Wisconsin to move to Chicago. Kate leaves a note in the mailbox for the next tenant to forward her letters should some slip through the system, further adding that the paint-embedded pawprints on the walkway leading into the house were already there when she arrived.
Two years earlier, in 2004, Alex Wyler, an architect, arrives at the lake house and finds Kate's letter in the mailbox. The house is neglected, with no sign of pawprints anywhere. As Alex restores the house, a dog runs through his paint and leaves fresh pawprints right where Kate said they would be. Both Alex and Kate continue passing messages to each other via the mailbox, and each watch its flag go up and down as the message leaves and the reply arrives, which takes place as they wait at the mailbox. They cautiously look around each time the flag changes, hoping to somehow spot the other, but in vain they do not, as they are alone at the mailbox.
Baffled, Alex writes back, asking how Kate knew about the pawprints since the house was unoccupied before he arrived. An equally perplexed Kate writes back, and she and Alex discover that they are living exactly two years apart. Their correspondence takes them through several events, including Alex finding a book, Persuasion, at a train station where Kate said she had lost it, and Alex taking Kate on a walking tour of his favorite places in Chicago via an annotated map that he leaves in the mailbox. Alex and Kate eventually meet at a party, but he doesn't mention their letter relationship to her.
As Alex and Kate continue to write each other, they decide to try to meet again. Alex makes a reservation at Il Mare (Italian for ""The Sea""), a restaurant whose name is a homage to the original Korean motion picture, for around March 2007 ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ two years in Alex's future, but only a day away for Kate. Kate goes to the restaurant but Alex fails to show. Heartbroken, Kate asks Alex not to write her again, recounting a tragedy a year ago before, on Valentine's Day 2006, when she witnessed a traffic accident near Daley Plaza and held a man who died in her arms. Both Alex and Kate leave the lake house, continuing on with their separate lives.
A year later, on Valentine's Day 2006 for Alex, Valentine's Day 2008 for Kate, Alex returns to the lake house after something about the day triggers his memory. Meanwhile, Kate goes to an architect to review renovation plans for a house she wants to buy. She notices a drawing of the lake house on the conference room wall and learns that Alex Wyler ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ the same person with whom she'd been corresponding ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ had drawn it. She also learns that Alex was killed in a traffic accident exactly two years ago to the day and realizes why he never showed up for their date; he was the man who died in Daley Plaza.
Rushing to the lake house, Kate writes a letter telling Alex she loves him, but begs him not to try to find her if he loves her back. Wait two years, she says, and come to the lake house instead. Meanwhile Alex has gone to Daley Plaza to find Kate.
At the lake house, Kate sobs, clutching onto the mailbox stand, sure she was too late, but then the mailbox flag lowers; Alex has picked up her note. Soon, she sees a vehicle arriving and then a figure walking toward her. It is Alex. They walk toward each other. Kate says, ""You waited!""

1543,The Last Stand,"The leader of a drug cartel busts out of a courthouse and speeds to the Mexican border, where the only thing in his path is a sheriff and his inexperienced staff.
Sheriff Owens is a man who has resigned himself to a life of fighting what little crime takes place in sleepy border town Sommerton Junction after leaving his LAPD post following a bungled operation that left him wracked with failure and defeat after his partner was crippled. After a spectacular escape from an FBI prisoner convoy, the most notorious, wanted drug kingpin in the hemisphere is hurtling toward the border at 200 mph in a specially outfitted car with a hostage and a fierce army of gang members. He is headed, it turns out, straight for Summerton Junction, where the whole of U.S. law enforcement will have their last opportunity to make a stand and intercept him before he slips across the border forever. At first reluctant to become involved, and then counted out because of the perceived ineptitude of his small town force, Owens ultimately accepts responsibility for the face off.

","Sheriff Ray Owens (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a man who has resigned himself to a life of fighting what little crime takes place in sleepy border town Sommerton Junction, Arizona, after leaving his LAPD post following a bungled operation that left him wracked with failure and defeat after his partner was crippled and his team decimated. The range of crimes experienced in Sommerton range from the Mayor parking his Camaro in the fire lane and vintage arms collector Lewis Dinkum (Johnny Knoxville) firing off guns at slabs of meat with the deputies. One night, international drug lord Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega) makes a daring escape from FBI custody in Las Vegas and speeds off in a modified Chevrolet Corvette C6 ZR1, taking Agent Ellen Richards (G‚àö¬©nesis Rodr‚àö‚â†guez) as his hostage as he races southbound toward Mexico at speeds over 200 mph. Agent John Bannister (Forest Whitaker) has a blockade set up in Bullhead City, Arizona, but Cortez's men mow down the police officers on site and clear the road for him to continue his getaway. Cortez also uses his extraordinary driving skills to immobilize two SWAT vehicles headed toward Summerton Junction. Before flying to Arizona, Agent Bannister has his team do a financial background check on all agents involved to find out how Cortez managed to escape so easily.
Sometime past 4:00 in the morning, Owens dispatches deputies Jerry Bailey (Zach Gilford) and Sarah Torrance (Jaimie Alexander) to visit the residence of the local farmer Parsons (Harry Dean Stanton), who has suddenly missed his usual milk delivery at the diner. After discovering that Parsons has been murdered, the deputies follow a trail of tire tracks that lead them to Cortez's henchman Thomas Burrell (Peter Stormare) and his mercenary cutthroats, who are planting a mobile assault bridge across the canyon that marks the U.S./Mexico border. Bailey is fatally shot in the middle of a shootout between the deputies and the thugs before Owens rushes in to bring his officers back to his precinct. Shortly after being notified by Agent Bannister of Cortez's presence, Owens gathers Torrance and senior Deputy Mike ""Figgy"" Figuerola (Luis Guzm‚àö¬∞n). He also deputizes jailed local Frank Martinez (Rodrigo Santoro), a former Marine with PTSD who developed a streak of never finishing what he started. Because Bailey was his friend, Martinez insists that he will not falter. Finally, Owens recruits Dinkum to protect their town. Dinkum agrees only if he becomes a deputy and if he keeps the gun he used at the beginning of the movie (having gotten in trouble for it previously).
At 7:10 AM, Owens and his deputies have the town's main road barricaded with cars when Burrell and his men arrive, prompting a lengthy shootout. Armed only with a Tommy Gun, Figuerola holds off the thugs before being injured by a sniper. Owens and Dinkum mow down a majority of the thugs with a Vickers machine gun mounted on the back of a school bus, while Torrance snipes several gunmen on the rooftops. After Owens kills Burrell, Cortez's Corvette eventually arrives in town, veering past the barricade as Owens and the deputies shoot at it. Cortez ejects Agent Richards from the car before speeding through a corn field. Suddenly, he encounters the Mayor's red Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 commandeered by Owens before both cars collide with a tractor. A dazed Cortez continues his escape on foot, but Owens meets him at the bridge. Owens ignores Cortez's bribe offers before both men wrestle each other. Despite sustaining slashes and stab wounds from Cortez's push dagger, Owens defeats the drug lord and handcuffs him before dragging him back into town with the battered Camaro. Agent Bannister arrives to take Cortez back into custody and arrests Agent Richards for taking the drug lord's bribe and aiding in his escape. Deputies Figuerola and Dinkum are taken to the hospital to be treated for their wounds. Martinez turns in the deputy's badge, Bailey's badge, that Owens had given him earlier. Owens tells him to keep it, as he's earned it. As the Mayor sees what is left of his Camaro, Owens warns him about parking in the fire lane before he, Torrance and Martinez walk into the diner.","county sheriff,old woman with a gun,calm before the storm,small town,shotgun,insider,amateur,bridge,fbi agent,in the way,drug lord,sheriff,fictional town,unpredictable,school bus,escape,never give up,villan,fugitive,convoy,sniper,double agent,machine gun,under estimate,deputy sheriff,jackass,informant,prisoner,deputy,zip line,quiet town,checkpoint,hostage,car chase,good die young,chevrolet corvette,better late than never,fbi,underestimate,medievel,race car",1543.jpg,2013-01-18,,oc0x-jiewTE,,,Drama
3376,The Last Temptation of Christ,"The life of Jesus Christ, his journey through life as he faces the temptations that all humans face during their lives, and his final temptation upon the cross.
The carpenter Jesus of Nazareth, tormented by the temptations of demons, the guilt of making crosses for the Romans, pity for men and the world, and the constant call of God, sets out to find what God wills for him. But as his mission nears fulfillment, he must face the greatest temptation: the normal life of a good man. Based, not on the Gospels, but on Nikos Kazantzakis' novel of the same name.

","The film begins with a man whispering in despair, ""The feeling begins. Very tender, very loving. Then the pain starts. Claws slip underneath the skin and tear their way up. Just before they reach my eyes, they dig in. And I remember. First I fasted for three months. I even whipped myself before I went to sleep. At first it worked. Then the pain came back. And the voices. They call me by the name: Jesus."" Jesus of Nazareth (Willem Dafoe) is a carpenter in Roman-occupied Judea, torn between his own desires and his knowledge that God has a plan for him. This conflict results in self-loathing, and he collaborates with the Romans to crucify Jewish revolutionaries.
Judas Iscariot (Harvey Keitel), originally sent to kill Jesus for collaboration,[1] instead suspects that Jesus is the Messiah and asks him to lead a revolution against the Romans. Jesus replies that his message is love of mankind; whereupon Judas joins Jesus in his ministry, but threatens to kill him if he strays from the purpose of a revolutionary. Jesus also has an undisclosed prior relationship with Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey), a Jewish prostitute, who asks Jesus to stay with her, a request that he considers before leaving for a monastic community. Jesus later saves Mary from a mob gathered to stone her for prostitution and working on the sabbath. Jesus compels the mob to spare her life, instructing ""Which one of you people has never sinned? Whoever that is, come up here and throw these"", with Jesus offering two stones.[2] (As explained in the DVD commentary track, Scorsese deliberately avoided the overly familiar statement, ""He who is without sin cast the first stone."") Later, Jesus preaches to the crowd using many of the parables from the Sermon on the Mount.
Jesus acquires disciples, but remains uncertain of his role. He visits John the Baptist, who baptizes Jesus, and that night the two discuss their differing theologies and political views. John believes that one must first gain freedom from the Romans to achieve their end, while Jesus maintains that love is more important and people should tend to matters of the spirit. Jesus then goes into the desert to test God's connection to himself, where he is tempted by Satan as a cobra, a lion, and a pillar of flame (voiced by Barbara Hershey, Harvey Keitel, and Leo Marks), but resists each of these and instead envisions himself with an axe, being instructed by John the Baptist in answer to Jesus' dilemma of whether to choose the path of love (symbolized by the heart) or the path of violence (represented by the axe). Jesus returns from the desert to the home of Martha and Mary of Bethany (both sisters of Lazarus), who restore him to health and attempt to persuade him that the way to please God is to have a home, a marriage, and children. Jesus then appears to his waiting disciples to tear out his own heart and invites them to follow him. With newfound confidence he restores sight to a blind man, changes water into wine, and raises Lazarus (Tomas Arana) from the dead.
Eventually his ministry reaches Jerusalem, where Jesus performs the Cleansing of the Temple and leads a small army to capture the temple by force, but halts on the steps to await a sign from God for what he must do next. He begins bleeding from his hands, which he recognizes as a sign that he must die on the cross to bring salvation to mankind. Confiding in Judas, he persuades the latter to give him to the Romans, despite Judas' inclination otherwise. Jesus convenes his disciples for Passover seder, later known as the Last Supper; whereupon Judas leads a contingent of soldiers to arrest Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, identifying him with a kiss. In the struggle to defend his master, Peter (Victor Argo) cuts off the ear of Malchus; whereupon Jesus reattaches it and turns himself over to the soldiers. Pontius Pilate (David Bowie) confronts Jesus and tells him that he must be put to death because he represents a threat to the Roman Empire. Jesus is subsequently flogged and a crown of thorns is placed on his head. He is then crucified.
While on the cross, Jesus converses with a young girl who claims to be his guardian angel (played by Juliette Caton). She tells him that he is neither the Son of God nor the Messiah, but that God loves him, is pleased with him, and wants him to be happy. She brings him down off the cross and, invisible to others, takes him to Mary Magdalene, whom he then marries. They are soon expecting a child and living an idyllic life; but Mary abruptly dies, and Jesus is consoled by his angel; wherefore he takes Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, for his wives. He starts a family with them, having many children, and lives his life in peace. Jesus is next seen as an older man who encounters the apostle Paul preaching about the Messiah and tries to tell Paul that he is the man about whom Paul has been preaching. Paul (who in this film has slain the resurrected Lazarus) repudiates him, saying that even if Jesus had not died on the cross, his message was the truth, and nothing would stop him from proclaiming that. Jesus debates him, claiming that salvation cannot be founded on lies.
Near the end of his life, an elderly Jesus calls upon his former disciples to his deathbed. Peter, Nathaniel, and a scarred John visit their master as Jerusalem is in the throes of rebellion; whereupon Judas comes last and reveals that the youthful angel who released Jesus from the crucifixion is in fact Satan. Crawling back through the burning city of Jerusalem, Jesus reaches the site of his crucifixion and begs God to let him fulfill his purpose and to ""let him be God's son.""
Jesus then finds himself once more on the cross, having overcome the ""last temptation"" of escaping death, being married and raising a family, and the ensuing disaster that would have consequently encompassed mankind. Naked and bloody, Jesus cries out in ecstasy as he dies, ""It is accomplished!"", and the screen flickers to white.","thought provoking,atmospheric,sincere,gloomy,contemplative,tense",3376.jpg,1988-08-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-last-temptation-of-christ/id506301810?uo=4,ihrMTU0lozs,,,Drama

191,The Lion King,"A lion prince, Simba, is born in Africa and the animals of the Pride Lands pay tribute. Later Simba is told by his father, King Mufasa, that when Mufasa dies, Simba will become King of the Pride Lands. Simba's Uncle Scar would have been king after Mufasa had Mufasa not had a child. Fuelled by rage, Scar plots to kill Mufasa and Simba so he is able to take over the throne. He uses the hyenas to cause a stampede through the canyon where Mufasa and Simba are, and personally ensures Mufasa falls to his death. Simba survives so Scar implies that the stampede was Simba's fault and that the pride will blame him. Simba flees the Pride Lands meaning never to return home. Simba is found, collapsed with exhaustion, by Timon the Meerkat, and Pumbaa the Warthog, and the trio become fast friends. Simba stays with them well into adulthood until his childhood friend, Nala, hunting beyond the Pride Lands that herds had deserted under Scar's mismanagement stumbles upon Simba's new home. Astonished to find him alive, she begs him to return to the Pride Lands, where Scar has reigned as King for years, and ruined everything. All of the animals will starve if Simba does not return. Simba eventually agrees to fight for his kingdom. Simba battles Scar, and learns his father's death was Scar's fault, not his own. Simba prevails and takes his fathers place as rightful king, mirroring ""The Circle of Life.""","In the Pride Lands of Africa, a lion king rules over the other animals, who celebrate the birth of future king Simba, son of King Mufasa and Queen Sarabi. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, doesn't attend the ceremony, due to his jealousy of not being King. Scar tells Mufasa he used to be next in line until Simba was born. A few years later, Simba grows into a curious lion cub, Mufasa gives him a tour of the Pride Lands, teaching him the responsibilities of being a king and warning him about the shadowy place beyond the borders. Later that day, Scar tells him that the shadowy place is an elephant graveyard. Simba's curiosity is piqued, and he convinces his best friend Nala, a female lion cub, to come with him. At the graveyard, the cubs are attacked by three spotted hyenas, Shenzi, Banzai and Ed, before Mufasa rescues them and willingly forgives Simba for disobeying him. The hyenas are friends of Scar, who then plot with them to take over the Pride Lands.
On Scar's orders, the hyenas stampede a large herd of wildebeest into a gorge where Simba is. Mufasa rescues Simba, but as Mufasa tries to climb up the gorge's walls, Scar throws him back into the stampede, killing him. After Simba finds Mufasa's body in the gorge, Scar tricks him into thinking that Mufasa's death is his fault and advises him to run away forever. As Simba leaves, Scar orders the hyenas to go after Simba, but the cub escapes. Scar then announces to the other animals that both Mufasa and Simba were killed and steps forward as the new king, allowing a swarm of hyenas to live in the Pride Lands.
Simba, now far from home, collapses in a desert from exhaustion, but is found by Timon and Pumbaa, a meerkat and a warthog who nurse him back to health. Timon and Pumbaa then take Simba in, and the lion lives a carefree life under the motto ""hakuna matata"". Years later, Simba, now an adult, rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. The two reconcile and fall in love. Nala tries to get Simba to come back home by saying that because of Scar allowing the hyenas to live in the Pride Lands, it has become a wasteland with not enough food and water. Still feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off.
Wise mandrill Rafiki tracks Simba down, telling him that Mufasa is still ""alive"" and taking him to a pond where he is visited by the specter of Mufasa, who tells him that he has forgotten who he is and thus must take his rightful place as the true king of Pride Rock. Simba then realizes that he can no longer run from his past and goes back home. Nala, Timon and Pumbaa follow him, and agree to help him fight.
At the Pride Lands, Simba confronts Scar on Pride Rock after he attacks his mother Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba, who still feels guilt over his father's death, but after pushing him over the edge of Pride Rock, Scar reveals that he killed Mufasa. The enraged Simba jumps back up and forces Scar to reveal the truth to the other lions. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki and the lionesses fight off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs Simba for mercy, saying he is family and places the blame on the hyenas. Simba says he does not believe Scar anymore, but spares his life and tells him to run away and never return. Scar meekly walks past him, but then attacks his nephew. After a fierce battle, Simba triumphs and throws Scar off Pride Rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them.
With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba descends from the top of Pride Rock where he is acknowledged by the pride as the rain falls again. Sometime later, Pride Rock is restored to its former glory and Simba looks down happily at his kingdom with Nala, Timon, and Pumbaa by his side; Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the inhabitants of the Pride Lands and the circle of life continues.","feel good,sentimental,joy,touching",191.jpg,1994-06-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-lion-king/id442123718?uo=4,4sj1MT05lAA,,,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Drama,Kids & Family,Musical & Performing Arts"

659,The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,"In the first part of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, a shy young hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood), inherits a simple gold ring. He knows the ring has power, but not that he alone holds the secret to the survival - or enslavement - of the entire world. Frodo, accompanied by a wizard, an elf, a dwarf, two men and three loyal hobbit friends, must now become the greatest hero the world has ever known to save the land and the people he loves. Also starring Academy Award and Golden Globe-winner Cate Blanchett, Academy Award-nominee and Golden Globe-winner Ian McKellan, Academy Award-nominee Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Liv Tyler. Winner of four Academy Awards including Best Cinematography, Best Original Score, Best Visual Effects and Best Makeup.","In the Second Age, the Dark Lord Sauron attempts to conquer Middle-earth using his One Ring. In battle against Sauron, Prince Isildur cuts the Ring from Sauron's hand, destroying his physical form. However, Sauron's life force is bound to the Ring, allowing him to survive while the Ring also survives. Isildur, corrupted by the Ring's power, refuses to destroy it. When Isildur is killed by Orcs, the Ring is lost in a river for 2,500 years. The Ring is found by Gollum, who possesses it for five hundred years until it is found by the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins.
Sixty years later, Bilbo leaves the Ring to his nephew, Frodo Baggins. Upon learning the Ring belonged to Sauron, the Wizard Gandalf the Grey warns Frodo that Sauron's forces will come for him, and has Frodo leave the shire accompanied by his friend Samwise Gamgee. Gandalf rides to Isengard to meet with the head of his order, Saruman the White, who reveals that Sauron's servants, the Nazg‚àö¬™l, have been sent to capture the Ring. Saruman reveals himself to be in service to Sauron and imprisons Gandalf atop his tower. Saruman commands Sauron's Orcs to construct weapons of war and produce a new breed of Orc fighters: the Uruk-hai.
While travelling to Bree to meet with Gandalf, Frodo and Sam are joined by Merry and Pippin and are nearly captured by the Nazg‚àö¬™l. The four reach Bree and meet the mysterious ranger Aragorn, who hides them from their pursuers and agrees to lead them to Rivendell since Gandalf hasn't arrived. The group rests at Weathertop where they are attacked by the Nazg‚àö¬™l, and Frodo is wounded by a Morgul blade, but Aragorn arrives and scares off the Nazg‚àö¬™l. Frodo is saved by the Elf Arwen, who uses her magic to summon a surge of water that sweeps away the pursuing Nazg‚àö¬™l. Arwen takes Frodo to Rivendell where her father, Elrond, heals him.
Gandalf escapes Saruman's tower with the aid of Gwaihir the eagle and travels to Rivendell. Elrond calls a council of the races still loyal to Middle-earth to decide what should be done with the Ring. He reveals that the Ring can only be destroyed by throwing it into the fires of Mount Doom in Mordor, where it was forged. Frodo volunteers to take the Ring to Mordor, accompanied by Sam, Merry, Pippin, Gandalf, and Aragorn. They are joined by the Elf Legolas, the Dwarf Gimli, and Boromir, a man of Gondor, to form the Fellowship of the Ring.
Hindered by Saruman's magic, the Fellowship are forced to travel through the abandoned Dwarf city of Moria. Inside, the Fellowship is attacked by Orcs and a Balrog, an ancient demon of fire and shadow. Gandalf confronts the Balrog, allowing the others to escape, but both Gandalf and the Balrog fall into an abyss. Mourning Gandalf's apparent death, the group flees to the forest of Lothl‚àö‚â•rien, where they are sheltered by its rulers, the Elves Galadriel and Celeborn. That night, Galadriel informs Frodo that it is his destiny to destroy the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman assembles a force of Uruk-hai to hunt the Fellowship.
After arriving at Parth Galen, Boromir, after hinting that the ring should be used to fight against Mordor, eventually gives in to the Ring's corruption and tries to take it from Frodo, believing it is the only way to save the people of Gondor. Heeding Galadriel's warning that the Ring will eventually corrupt the other members of the Fellowship, Frodo escapes by the Ring's power of invisibility and decides to continue his journey alone. The Uruk-hai arrive, and Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli attempt to hold them off while Frodo escapes. Merry, Pippin, and a remorseful Boromir lead the Orcs away from Frodo. Boromir is shot fatally by the Uruk-hai's leader, Lurtz, while Merry and Pippin are captured by the rest of the Uruk-hai. Aragorn slays Lurtz, and Boromir dies with Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas by his side. The three set out to rescue Merry and Pippin, while Frodo lets Sam join him to Mordor.","exciting,epic,suspenseful,trust,joy,stylized,my precious,atmospheric,anticipation,fear",659.jpg,2001-12-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/lord-rings-fellowship-ring/id319646018?uo=4,GgF5QTsonn8,,,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Drama,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
204,The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"""One ring to rule them all. One ring to find them. One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them."" -- J.R.R. Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings -- In the conclusion of J.R.R. Tolkien's epic masterpiece, The Lord of the Rings, as armies mass for a final battle that will decide the fate of the world -- and powerful, ancient forces of Light and Dark compete to determine the outcome -- one member of the Fellowship of the Ring is revealed as the noble heir to the throne of the Kings of Men. Yet, the sole hope for triumph over evil lies with a brave hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood - ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" ""Everything is Illuminated""), who, accompanied only by his loyal friend Sam and the hiddeous, wretched Gollum, ventures deep into the very dark heart of Mordor on his seemingly impossible quest to destroy the Ring of Power.

Winner of 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture and Best Director!","Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Th‚àö¬©oden, Gamling, and ‚àö√¢omer meet up with Merry, Pippin and Treebeard at Isengard. The group returns to Edoras, where Pippin looks into Saruman's recovered palant‚àö‚â†r, in which Sauron appears and invades his mind; Pippin tells him nothing regarding Frodo and the Ring. From this event, Gandalf deduces that Sauron is planning to attack Minas Tirith. Gandalf rides with Pippin to find Denethor, the Steward of Gondor, to whom Pippin swears his service. Gandalf urges Denethor to call Rohan for aid, but Denethor declines, fearing Aragorn and Gandalf plan to depose him. The Morgul army, led by the Nazg‚àö¬™l, drives the Gondorians out of Osgiliath. Denethor sends his son Faramir on a suicide mission to reclaim the city. Under instruction from Gandalf, Pippin evades city guards to light the distress beacon, signalling Th‚àö¬©oden and Aragorn to assemble the Rohirrim for battle.
Elrond informs Aragorn that Arwen did not go to the Undying Lands, and is now dying. Believing their forces to be outnumbered by Sauron's, Elrond gives Aragorn the sword And‚àö‚à´ril to acquire the service of the Army of the Dead, who owe allegiance to the heir of Isildur. ‚àö√¢owyn confesses her love for Aragorn and asks him not to go, but Aragorn reaffirms his love for Arwen and heads into battle. Accompanied by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn ventures into the Paths of the Dead and gains the loyalty of the King of the Dead and his men by brandishing And‚àö‚à´ril, proving himself the Heir of Isildur. At Dunharrow, Th‚àö¬©oden rides off to war, unaware that ‚àö√¢owyn and Merry have secretly joined his forces.
Sauron's armies lay siege to Minas Tirith, led by the Witch-king. Believing a grievously wounded Faramir to be dead, Denethor tries to burn his son and himself alive, but Gandalf intervenes; he saves Faramir, but Denethor commits suicide. Just as the Gondorians are about to be overrun, the Rohirrim army arrives and counter-attacks in a massive cavalry charge led by Th‚àö¬©oden. This shifts the tide of the battle, and the Orcs begin to retreat. However, the Haradrim arrive and join the Orc army, turning the tide. The Witch-king kills Th‚àö¬©oden, only to be wounded by Merry and finished off by ‚àö√¢owyn. On the verge of defeat, the Rohirrim are saved when Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli arrive with the Army of the Dead and overwhelm Sauron's forces, ending the battle. Aragorn frees the Army of the Dead and their souls go to the afterlife.
Meanwhile, Frodo, Sam and Gollum travel to Minas Morgul. Sam overhears Gollum's plans to murder them and take the Ring for himself. Gollum persuades Frodo that Sam wants the Ring for himself, and Frodo angrily tells Sam to go home. A heartbroken Sam leaves, but discovers Gollum's treachery and follows after them. Gollum betrays Frodo, leaving him in the lair of the giant spider Shelob, who paralyses Frodo before being wounded and driven away by Sam. An Orc patrol captures Frodo and takes him to Sauron's fortress. Sam rescues Frodo from the tower, and they continue the journey to Mount Doom.
Meanwhile, Aragorn leads his remaining men to the Black Gate of Mordor, distracting Sauron and his forces and allowing Sam and Frodo to enter Mount Doom. Sam carries the weakened Frodo up the volcano, but Gollum attacks them. At the Crack of Doom, Frodo succumbs to the Ring's power, refusing to destroy it. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off, seizing the Ring for himself. An enraged Frodo attacks Gollum, and they both fall over the edge. At the last second, Frodo grabs onto the ledge, leaving Gollum to fall into the lava, taking the Ring with him. As the Ring melts in the volcano, Sauron is destroyed and the land of Mordor collapses, taking down most of his forces.
Frodo and Sam are saved from the rising lava by Eagles, led by Gandalf. In the aftermath, Aragorn is crowned King, heralding a new age of peace, and marry Arwen while the four hobbits are bowed by all of Gondor for their courageous efforts. The four Hobbits return home to the Shire, where Sam marries his childhood sweetheart, Rosie Cotton. Four years later, Frodo leaves Middle-earth for the Undying Lands with Gandalf, Bilbo, Elrond, Celeborn, and Galadriel, leaving his account of their quest to Sam.","exciting,suspenseful,joy,stylized,my precious,anticipation,atmospheric,fear",204.jpg,2003-12-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/lord-rings-return-king/id297709333?uo=4,r5X-hFf6Bwo,,,"Action & Adventure,Classics,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

362,The Magnificent Seven,"An American remake of Akira Kurasawa's Japanese classic, ""The Seven Samurai.""  A bandit terrorizes a small Mexican farming village each year. Several of the village elders send three of the farmers into the United States to search for gunmen to defend them. They end up with 7, each of whom comes for a different reason. They must prepare the town to repulse an army of over 100 bandits who will arrive wanting all of their food.","A Mexican village is periodically raided for food and supplies by bandits led by Calvera (Eli Wallach). As he and his men rode away from their latest visit, Calvera had promised to return for more booty and loot the village again. Taking what meager goods they have, the village leaders ride to a town just inside the American border hoping to barter for weapons to defend themselves. While there, they encounter veteran gunslinger, Chris (Yul Brynner); after listening to their tale, Chris suggests that the village hire more gunfighters as they would be cheaper than guns and ammunition. The village men relentlessly try to convince Chris to be their gunman; while at first he agrees just to help them find men, eventually he decides to help them out in person as well as finding six other men to join them, despite the poor pay offered.
The other men include hotheaded, inexperienced Chico (Horst Buchholz); Chris's friend Harry Luck (Brad Dexter) who believes Chris is seeking treasure; the drifter Vin (Steve McQueen), who has gone broke after a round of gambling; Bernardo O'Reilly (Charles Bronson), a gunfighter of Irish-Mexican heritage; cowboy Britt (James Coburn); and an on-the-run gunman Lee (Robert Vaughn), who is in the midst of a crisis of confidence. The group recognizes they will be outnumbered, but hope that when Calvera realizes that the village has brought them aboard, he will move on to a different village.
Arriving at the village, the seven begin to train the villagers how to defend themselves. They all find themselves bonding with the villagers, sharing the meal the women of the village have made them when they discover that the villagers have little food themselves. Chico is fascinated by Petra, one of the village's young women, while Bernardo begins to bond with three of the village's little boys.[3][4] Lee, meanwhile, struggles with nightmares and fears the loss of his skills. Calvera and his bandits soon arrive, sustain heavy losses, and are run out of town by the gunmen and the villagers working in concert. Chico, who is Mexican, follows Calvera back to his camp, pretending to be one of the gang of bandits. There he learns that Calvera plans to return and raid the village because he is desperate for the food in order to feed his men.
Chico reports this back to Chris and the rest of the men. Though a part of the group believes they should leave, Chris insists that they stay and they ride out to make a surprise raid on Calvera's camp. However, they find the camp empty and, on returning to the village, they find that the fearful villagers allowed Calvera to take control. Calvera spares the gunmen's lives, believing they have learned the lesson that the simple farmers are not worth fighting for. Calvera also fears reprisals from the U.S. Army. The seven are curtly escorted out of the village. The group debates their next move and all but Harry agree to return and free the village from Calvera. Harry believes the effort will lead to their deaths and rides off alone.
A gunfight breaks out, and the villagers, recognizing the courage of the gunmen, soon join in the fight. Bernardo is killed protecting the children he had befriended, and both Britt and Lee die after killing a considerable number of bandits. Harry, who had a change of heart, arrives in time to protect Chris but is fatally shot. Soon, the bandits are routed, and Chris shoots Calvera. Calvera, in his dying breath, asks why men like Chris came back to protect such a small village.
The three remaining gunmen help to bury their own and the villagers' dead. Chico announces he will be staying with Petra, while Chris and Vin begin to ride out. The village elder bids them farewell and comments that it is only the villagers who have really won: ""You're like the wind, blowing over the land and...passing on;... ¬¨¬∞Vaya con Dios!"" However, as they leave and pass the graves of their fallen comrades, Chris fatalistically observes, ""The Old Man was right. Only the farmers won. We lost.

2296,The Mask of Zorro,"A sweeping romantic adventure of love and honor, tragedy and triumph set against Mexico's fight for independence. Twenty years have past since Don Diego de la Vega (Hopkins) fought oppression as the legendary hero, Zorro. Now he must find a successor and he chooses Alejandro Murietta (Banderas), a bandit with a troubled past who he must, somehow, transform into the fearless fighter he once had been. Then, armed with sword, whip, mask and the jet-black stallion, Tornado, the new Zorro must stop tyrant Raphael Montero, newly returned from Spain with a plot to actually buy California and enslave the populous to work in his mines.","In 1821, Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins) fights against Spain in the Mexican War of Independence as Zorro, a mysterious avenger who defends the Mexican peasants and commoners of Las Californias. Don Rafael Montero (Stuart Wilson), the cruel governor of the region, learns de la Vega's identity. Arresting de la Vega in his home, his beloved wife Esperanza (Julieta Rosen) is accidentally killed by one of Montero's soldiers. Montero imprisons de la Vega and takes his infant daughter, Elena, as his own and leaves for Spain.
Twenty years later, Montero returns from exile in Spain with Elena (Catherine Zeta-Jones), who has grown into a beautiful woman, by his side. He is planning to turn California into an independent republic. However, his reappearance also awakens a long-dormant de la Vega, who has spent two decades living in anonymity during his imprisonment. He escapes from prison, and as he plans his revenge on Montero, de la Vega encounters a thief, Alejandro Murrieta (Antonio Banderas), who - along with his brother - greatly admired Zorro as a child and even had a small hand in the hero's last great exploit. After a brief period of deliberation, de la Vega decides to take Alejandro as his prot‚àö¬©g‚àö¬©. Inspired by the wish for revenge upon Captain Harrison Love (Matt Letscher), his brother's killer and Montero's right hand man, he endures the tough training regimen brilliantly.
After Alejandro steals a black stallion resembling Toronado, Zorro's long deceased horse, and leaves Zorro's mark at the scene, de la Vega scolds him claiming that Zorro was a servant of the people, not a thief or adventurer. He challenges Alejandro to gain Montero's trust and pose as Don Alejandro del Castillo y Garc‚àö‚â†a, a visiting nobleman, with de la Vega posing as his servant, Bernardo. Both attend a party at Montero's hacienda, where he gains Elena's admiration and titillation and enough of Montero's trust to be invited to a secret meeting. There, Montero hints at a plan to retake California for the Dons by buying it from General Santa Anna, who needs money to fund his upcoming war with the United States.
Alejandro and the Dons are taken to a secret gold mine known as ""El Dorado"", where peasants and criminals are used for slave labor. The plan is to buy California from Santa Anna using gold mined from Santa Anna's own land. Meanwhile, de la Vega uses this opportunity to become closer to Elena: still posing as Bernardo, he learns that Montero raised her telling her that her mother died in childbirth. De la Vega sends Alejandro, as Zorro, to steal the map leading to the gold mine: he duels Montero, Love, and their guards at the hacienda. When Alejandro escapes, Elena attempts to retrieve Montero's map, but he uses his sword to strip off her clothing and seduces her, leading to a passionate kiss before he flees.
Terrified of Santa Anna's retribution if he discovers that he is being paid with his own gold, Montero decides to destroy the mine, along with all its workers, to better hide all evidence. De la Vega tells Alejandro to release the workers on his own so that he can reclaim Elena: he corners Montero at his hacienda and reveals his identity, but is captured. As he is taken away, Elena, inspired by a chance encounter with a woman who had been her nanny at the market, asks Montero the name of the flower that her mother had hung about her crib: when it is de la Vega who tells Elena its name, she realizes he is her father.

","Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is a sex-obsessed alcoholic World War II veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and possible brain damage from drinking torpedo juice struggling to adjust to a post-war society, having had questionable mental status before the war. During his transition, a military specialist performs an inkblot word association test. After each innocuous abstract image he replies with a sexual reference. He becomes a portrait photographer at a local department store, but is soon fired for getting into a drunken fight with a customer. Freddie then finds work on a cabbage farm, but his moonshine poisons one of the elderly migrant workers and he is chased off the farm.
One night, intoxicated, Freddie stows away on the yacht of Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the leader of a philosophical movement known as ""The Cause"". When he is discovered Dodd invites Freddie to stay and attend the marriage of Dodd's daughter, Elizabeth, as long as he will make more of his mysterious brew (made with paint thinner), which Dodd has developed a taste for. Dodd begins an exercise with Freddie called Processing, a flurry of disturbing psychological questioning aimed at conquering Freddie's past traumas. Freddie reveals that his father has died, his mother is institutionalized, he may have had an incestuous relationship with his aunt, and he abandoned the love of his life, a young girl named Doris who wrote to him while he was at war. Freddie is enthralled by Dodd, who doesn't flinch from his abject revelations, and Dodd sees something in Freddie. Freddie travels with Dodd's family as they spread the teachings of ""The Cause"" along the East Coast, as guests in the homes of various women drawn to ""The Cause"". But Freddie's violent and erratic behavior has not improved, nor has his alcoholism. At a dinner party in New York, a man questions Dodd's methods and statements, and Freddie pursues him to his apartment and assaults him that night.
Other members of ""The Cause"" begin to worry about Freddie's behavior, despite Dodd's attachment to him. While they are guests of an acolyte in Philadelphia, Dodd's wife Peggy (Amy Adams) tells Freddie that he must quit drinking if he wishes to stay, to which he agrees. However, he has no true intention of keeping his promise. Freddie criticizes Dodd's son Val for disregarding his father's teachings, but Val tells Freddie that Dodd is making things up as he goes along. Dodd is arrested for practising medicine without proper qualifications, after one of his former hostesses has a change of heart, as is Freddie, for assaulting the police officers. In the jail cell adjacent to Dodd, Freddie smashes the toilet and batters himself against the bars and his bunk, while Dodd tries to calm him. But Freddie erupts in a tirade, questioning everything that Dodd has taught him, and accuses him of being a fake. The two men trade insults until Dodd turns his back. They reconcile upon their release, but members of ""The Cause"" have become more suspicious and fearful of Freddie, believing him to be insane or an undercover agent.
Freddie submits to additional exercises with ""The Cause"", but becomes increasingly angry and frustrated with his lack of results and repetition of the exercises. Eventually he passes the tests, with Dodd hugging him in approval. They travel to Phoenix, Arizona, to release Dodd's latest work, which he was initially hesitant to publish. When Dodd's publisher criticizes the quality of the book and its teachings to Freddie, he goes outside with the publisher and assaults him. Helen Sullivan, their Philadelphia hostess, confronts Dodd in the lecture hall for suggesting that members ""imagine"" rather than ""recall"" the experiences of ""other lives"" in his new book, and he responds with anger. During another exercise, in which Freddie is supposed to ride a motorcycle at high speed through the desert towards an object in the distance and then return, he instead abandons Dodd, rides the motorcycle out of the desert, and decides to leave ""The Cause"". He goes home to rekindle his relationship with Doris, but learns from her mother that she has married and started a family in Alabama in the seven years since he last saw her. Freddie leaves disappointed, but he seems pleased that Doris has made a happy life for herself.
While sleeping in a movie theater, Freddie has a ""vision"" of Dodd, who calls him by telephone, having mysteriously located him. Dodd informs Freddie that he is now residing in England and that Freddie must join him as soon as possible. Taking the dream literally, he travels across the Atlantic to reunite with Dodd. When Freddie arrives, he discovers Val is still in his father's employ and that Elizabeth has been expelled from the movement. Dodd seems happy to see him but Peggy tells him that Freddie has no intention of improving his life and that he should no longer be involved in ""The Cause"". Dodd finally realizes that his wife is correct and that Freddie must venture out to the world and take his own path. He gives Freddie an ultimatum: stay with ""The Cause"" and devote himself to it for the rest of his life or leave and never return. Dodd then serenades Freddie with the song Slow Boat to China. The closing shots of Freddie walking down a forested road alone, then having sex with a woman he meets at a bar as he repeats lines from his first Processing session with Dodd, makes it unclear if he decided to leave ""The Cause"" or stay with it.","past life,right hand man,author,rorschach inkblot,scientology,psychological testing,alcoholic,world war two,control,black comedy,cult,navy,manipulation,husband wife relationship,religion,charismatic leader,1950s,cult leader,writer,world war two veteran,nuclear physicist,picturing woman naked,religious cult,drifter,naked woman,imagining someone naked,cause",7297.jpg,2012-09-21,,fJ1O1vb9AUU,,,Drama

3384,The Matrix,"A computer hacker learns from mysterious rebels about the true nature of his reality and his role in the war against its controllers.
Thomas A. Anderson is a man living two lives. By day he is an average computer programmer and by night a hacker known as Neo. Neo has always questioned his reality, but the truth is far beyond his imagination. Neo finds himself targeted by the police when he is contacted by Morpheus, a legendary computer hacker branded a terrorist by the government. Morpheus awakens Neo to the real world, a ravaged wasteland where most of humanity have been captured by a race of machines that live off of the humans' body heat and electrochemical energy and who imprison their minds within an artificial reality known as the Matrix. As a rebel against the machines, Neo must return to the Matrix and confront the agents: super-powerful computer programs devoted to snuffing out Neo and the entire human rebellion.

","Thomas Anderson is a computer programmer who maintains a double life as the hacker ""Neo"". He is driven to learn the meaning of cryptic references to ""the Matrix"" that appear on his computer. Infamous hacker Trinity contacts Neo and informs him that a man named Morpheus can tell him what the Matrix is; however, three Agents, led by Agent Smith, arrest Neo to prevent this. Undeterred, Neo meets with Morpheus and confirms that he wants to learn more about the Matrix by choosing an offered red pill. After swallowing the pill, Neo abruptly awakens in a liquid-filled vessel, connected along with billions of other people to an elaborate electrical structure. He is rescued by Morpheus and brought aboard a levitating ship, the Nebuchadnezzar.
Morpheus tells Neo that humans are fighting against intelligent machines that were created in the 21st century and have since taken control of the Earth's surface. Humans polluted the sky to cut off the machines' solar power, but the machines adapted to using human bioelectricity as a power source. Enslaved humans are kept docile within the ""Matrix"" ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a simulation of the world as it was in 1999. Neo has lived in this simulated world since birth; in reality, the year is closer to 2199. Morpheus explains that he and his crew belong to a group of free humans who ""unplug"" others from the Matrix and recruit them to their rebellion against the Machines. They can hack into the Matrix and re-enter the simulated reality, where their understanding of its true nature allows them to manipulate its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Neo undergoes virtual combat training. He is warned that fatal injuries within the Matrix will also kill one's physical body, and that the Agents he encountered are powerful sentient programs that patrol the Matrix and eliminate threats to the system. Morpheus believes Neo is ""the One"", a man prophesied to end the war between humans and machines.
After Neo's training, the group enters the Matrix to visit the Oracle, a prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. The Oracle implies that Neo is not the One, and warns he must soon choose between his own life and that of Morpheus.
As the group prepares to exit the Matrix, they are ambushed by Agents and tactical police, leading to the death of a crew member called Mouse. Morpheus allows himself to be captured to let Neo and the rest of the crew escape. As they prepare to leave the Matrix, they learn that a crew member named Cypher has betrayed them. Disillusioned with the real world, Cypher had arranged to hand Morpheus over to the Agents in exchange for being returned to a comfortable life within the Matrix. Aboard the Nebuchadnezzar, Cypher murders crew members Switch, Apoc and Dozer before he is killed by Dozer's brother Tank.
In the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the mainframe computer in Zion, the humans' last refuge in the real world. Neo returns to the Matrix with Trinity and rescues Morpheus; in the process, Neo gains confidence in his ability to manipulate the Matrix, performing physical feats on a par with the Agents.
Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Neo is ambushed by Smith before he can leave. In the real world, ""sentinel"" machines converge on the Nebuchadnezzar. In the Matrix, Smith kills Neo. In the real world, Trinity whispers to Neo that the Oracle told her she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo, and he revives in the Matrix. He displays the power to perceive and control the Matrix, effortlessly destroying Smith before exiting the Matrix in time for the ship's EMP weapon to destroy the attacking sentinels.
In the Matrix, Neo makes a telephone call, promising the Machines he will show their prisoners ""a world where anything is possible"". He ends the call and flies into the sky.","opening action scene,dodge bullets,robot,shootout,combat,welcome to the real world,matrix,learn,facing reality,telephone box,artificial reality,mescaline,fist fight,kiss of life,neo,artificial human,simulated reality,slavery,religion,computer,belly button,humanity in peril,technology gone amok,go your way,hypodermic needle,false reality,glitch,white rabbit,altruism,traitor,mixed martial arts,action hero,surprise,electro magnetic pulse,jumping between buildings,revolution,neo,post apocalypse,mma,code,guns,floppy disk,never send a human to do a machine's job,self sacrifice,oracle,time freeze,cubicle,buddhism,reincarnation,machine gun,trust,red pill,sunglasses,hacking,artificial intelligence,trilogy,real world,nightclub,dodging bullets,reflect,fear,software,stylized,1 of 3,impossible,cyberspace,red dress,maya,tough guy,slave,martial arts,one against many,swat team,agent,kung fu,free your mind,subterranean,hacker,2190s,tcp/ip,elevator,ai,knife throwing,internet,mobile,war against machines,neo noir,gatling gun,energy source,tech noir,hacker,computer program,deja vu,virtuality,hero,sacrifice,wearing sunglasses inside,revolving door,cypher,reversal of power,escape,warrior,white rabbit,human versus computer,red dress,computer hacker,first part,training,trace,chase on the roof,grim reality,sentinel,men in black,tattoo,fate,beretta,abandoned subway station,woman with dark glasses,evolution,fictional war,transformation,allegory of the cave,punched in the face,thought provoking,king fu,rooftop chase,government agent,crops,look again,gestapo,blue pill,brawl,telephone booth,falling from height,man versus machine,philosophy,interrogation,man with dark glasses,hinduism,belief,rebellion,mind bending,virus,lucid dream,true believer,rabbiot hole,plug in,chosen one,dream,dream sequence,pump action shotgun,human machine relationship,dojo,telephone,alice in wonderland,joy,mexican standoff,22nd century,emp,police officer,the one,cyberpunk,pill,20th century,wired,prophecy,download,future,app,truth,miracle,bullet dodging,bullet time,simulation,violence,inability to speak,rescue,one man army,suspenseful,christianity,kung fu,showdown,advaita vedanta,hand to hand combat,trinity,cell phone,pioneer,black cat,spoon,broken sunglasses,rayban,utopia,pill,flow motion,anticipation,handcuffs,slow motion scene,1990s,jumping,dream world,morphing,salvation,rough,war with machines,exciting,punched in the ribs,ringing telephone,alternative reality,fly,torture,mainframe computer,roof chase,plato,lady in red,betrayal,flying man,questioning reality,christ allegory,black,mentor,parallel world,virus,believe,oracle,realization,messiah,wire fu,hit me,training program,freedom fighter,future noir,gunfight,location,dodge,programmer,cyberspace,555 phone number,simulator,bullet time,what if,energy,deception,contemplative,helicopter crash,virtual reality,reality,digital,alice in wonderland,role reversal",3384.jpg,1999-03-31, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-matrix/id271469518?uo=4,UM5yepZ21pI,,,"Action & Adventure,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
2465,The Matrix Reloaded,"Neo and the rebel leaders estimate that they have 72 hours until 250,000 probes discover Zion and destroy it and its inhabitants. During this, Neo must decide how he can save Trinity from a dark fate in his dreams.
6 months after the events depicted in The Matrix, Neo has proved to be a good omen for the free humans, as more and more humans are being freed from the matrix and brought to Zion, the one and only stronghold of the Resistance. Neo himself has discovered his superpowers including super speed, ability to see the codes of the things inside the matrix and a certain degree of pre-cognition. But a nasty piece of news hits the human resistance: 250,000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would reach them in 72 hours. As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source. Meanwhile Neo's recurrent dreams depicting Trinity's death have got him worried and as if it was not enough, Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion, has become more powerful than before and has fixed Neo as his next target.

","Six months after the events of the first movie, Morpheus receives a message from Captain Niobe of the Logos calling an emergency meeting of all of Zion's ships. Zion has confirmed the last transmission of the Osiris: an army of Sentinels is tunneling towards Zion and will reach it within 72 hours. Commander Lock orders all ships to return to Zion to prepare for the onslaught. Morpheus asks a ship to remain in order to contact the Oracle, in defiance of the order. The Caduceus receives a message from the Oracle, and the Nebuchadnezzar ventures out so Neo can contact her. One of the Caduceus crew, Bane, encounters Agent Smith, who takes over Bane's avatar. Smith then uses this avatar to leave the Matrix, gaining control of Bane's real body.
In Zion, Morpheus announces the news of the advancing machines to the people. Neo receives a message from the Oracle and returns to the Matrix to her bodyguard Seraph, who then leads them to her. After realizing that the Oracle is part of the Matrix, Neo asks how he can trust her; she replies that it is his decision. The Oracle instructs Neo to reach the Source of the Matrix by finding the Keymaker, a prisoner of the Merovingian. As the Oracle departs, Smith appears, telling Neo that after being defeated, he refused to be deleted, and is now a rogue program. He demonstrates his ability to clone himself using other people in the Matrix, including other Agents, as hosts. He then tries to absorb Neo as a host, but fails, prompting a battle between Neo and Smith's clones. Neo manages to hold his own, but is forced to retreat from the increasingly overwhelming numbers.
Neo, Morpheus and Trinity visit the Merovingian and ask for the Keymaker, but the Merovingian refuses. His wife Persephone, tired of her husband's attitude, betrays him and leads the trio to the Keymaker. The Merovingian soon arrives with his men. Morpheus, Trinity and the Keymaker escape, while Neo holds off the Merovingian's servants. Morpheus and Trinity try to escape with the Keymaker on the highway, facing several Agents and The Twins. Morpheus defeats The Twins; Trinity escapes, and Neo flies in to save Morpheus and the Keymaker.
In the real world, Zion's remaining ships prepare to battle the machines. Within the Matrix, the crews of the Nebuchadnezzar, Vigilant and Logos help the Keymaker and Neo reach the door to the Source. The crew of the Logos must destroy a power plant to prevent a security system from being triggered, and the crew of the Vigilant must destroy a back-up power station. The Logos is successful, while the Vigilant is bombed by a Sentinel in the real world, killing everyone on board. Although Neo requested that Trinity remain on the Nebuchadnezzar, she enters the Matrix to replace the Vigilant crew and complete their mission. However, her escape is compromised by an Agent, and they fight. As Neo, Morpheus and the Keymaker try to reach the Source, the Smiths appear and try to kill them. The Keymaker unlocks the door to the Source, allowing Neo and Morpheus to escape, but the Keymaker is killed.
Neo meets a program called the Architect, the Matrix's creator. The Architect explains that Neo is part of the design of the Matrix, and unless Neo returns to the Source to reboot the Matrix and pick survivors to repopulate the soon-to-be-destroyed Zion, the Matrix will crash, killing everyone connected to it. Combined with Zion's utter destruction, this would mean mankind's extinction, but the machines would survive. Neo learns of Trinity's situation and chooses to save her instead. As she falls off a building, he flies in and catches her, then removes a bullet from her body and restarts her heart.
Back in the real world, Sentinels destroy the Nebuchadnezzar. Neo displays a new ability to disable the machines with his thoughts, but falls into a coma from the effort. The crew are picked up by another ship, the Hammer. Its captain, Roland, reveals the remaining ships were wiped out by the machines after someone activated an EMP too early. Bane, who has murdered the rest of the Caduceus crew, is revealed as the only survivor.","opening action scene,robot,shootout,combat,welcome to the real world,matrix,learn,facing reality,telephone box,artificial reality,fist fight,kiss of life,mescaline,neo,artificial human,simulated reality,slavery,religion,computer,belly button,humanity in peril,technology gone amok,hypodermic needle,false reality,glitch,altruism,traitor,mixed martial arts,action hero,electro magnetic pulse,revolution,neo,mma,code,post apocalypse,guns,never send a human to do a machine's job,self sacrifice,oracle,2 of 3,time freeze,cubicle,buddhism,machine gun,reincarnation,red pill,sunglasses,artificial intelligence,trilogy,real world,nightclub,dodging bullets,fear,software,stylized,impossible,cyberspace,red dress,tough guy,maya,slave,martial arts,one against many,agent,kung fu,free your mind,subterranean,hacker,2190s,ai,elevator,knife throwing,war against machines,neo noir,gatling gun,tech noir,energy source,hacker,computer program,virtuality,sacrifice,hero,cypher,reversal of power,escape,warrior,human versus computer,computer hacker,first part,training,trace,chase on the roof,grim reality,sentinel,men in black,fate,beretta,abandoned subway station,woman with dark glasses,evolution,fictional war,transformation,punched in the face,king fu,rooftop chase,government agent,crops,gestapo,blue pill,brawl,telephone booth,falling from height,man versus machine,philosophy,hinduism,rebellion,belief,virus,true believer,lucid dream,rabbiot hole,plug in,frenchman,chosen one,dream,dream sequence,dojo,human machine relationship,telephone,alice in wonderland,emp,22nd century,cyberpunk,pill,20th century,prophecy,download,future,truth,miracle,bullet dodging,bullet time,simulation,violence,one man army,rescue,suspenseful,christianity,kung fu,showdown,advaita vedanta,hand to hand combat,trinity,cell phone,spoon,rayban,utopia,pill,flow motion,anticipation,handcuffs,slow motion scene,1990s,jumping,dream world,morphing,salvation,rough,war with machines,exciting,ringing telephone,alternative reality,torture,mainframe computer,roof chase,plato,lady in red,betrayal,flying man,questioning reality,christ allegory,black,parallel world,mentor,virus,oracle,believe,realization,messiah,wire fu,hit me,freedom fighter,future noir,gunfight,location,programmer,cyberspace,simulator,bullet time,what if,energy,deception,helicopter crash,virtual reality,reality,digital,alice in wonderland",2465.jpg,2003-05-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-matrix-reloaded/id283218560?uo=4,zsgrsiZoymA,,,"Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

Neo discovers that somehow he is able to use his powers in the real world too and that his mind can be freed from his body, as a result of which he finds himself trapped on a train station between the Matrix and the Real World. Meanwhile, Zion is preparing for the oncoming war with the machines with very little chances of survival. Neo's associates set out to free him from The Merovingian since it's believed that he is the One who will end the war between humans and the machines.

","Neo and Bane lie unconscious in the medical bay of the ship Hammer. Meanwhile, Neo finds his digital self trapped in a virtual subway station ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ a transition zone between the Matrix and the Machine City. In that subway station, he meets a ""family"" of programs, including a girl named Sati, whose father tells Neo the subway is controlled by the Trainman, an exiled program loyal to the Merovingian. When Neo tries to board a train with the family, the Trainman refuses and overpowers him.
Seraph contacts Morpheus and Trinity on behalf of the Oracle, who informs them of Neo's confinement. Seraph, Morpheus and Trinity enter Club Hel, where they confront the Merovingian and force him to release Neo. Troubled by visions of the Machine City, Neo visits the Oracle, who reveals that Smith intends to destroy both the Matrix and the real world. She states that ""everything that has a beginning has an end"", and that the war will conclude. After Neo leaves, a large group of Smiths assimilates Sati, Seraph and the unresisting Oracle, gaining her powers of precognition.
In the real world, the crew of the Nebuchadnezzar and the Hammer find and reactivate Niobe's ship, the Logos. They interrogate Bane, who claims to have no memory of the earlier massacre. As the captains plan their defense of Zion, Neo requests a ship to travel to the Machine City. Motivated by her encounter with the Oracle, Niobe offers him the Logos. Neo departs, accompanied by Trinity. Bane, who has stowed away on the Logos, takes Trinity hostage. Neo realizes that Bane has been assimilated by Smith. Bane cauterizes Neo's eyes with a power cable, blinding him; however, Neo discovers an ability to perceive the world as golden light. Neo kills Bane, and Trinity pilots them to the Machine City. Niobe and Morpheus set out for Zion with the Hammer to aid the human defenses against the Sentinels. In Zion, the fatally wounded Captain Mifune instructs Kid to open the gate for the Hammer. When it arrives, it discharges its EMP, disabling the Sentinels but also the remaining defenses. The humans are forced to retreat and wait for the next attack, which they believe will be their last stand. Neo and Trinity are attacked by machines, causing them to crash the Logos into the Machine City. The crash kills Trinity.
Neo enters the Machine City and encounters the ""Deus Ex Machina"", the machine leader. Neo, warning that Smith plans to conquer both the Matrix and the real world, offers to stop Smith in exchange for peace with Zion. The machine leader agrees, and the Sentinels stop attacking Zion. The Machines provide a connection for Neo to enter the Matrix. Inside, Neo finds that Smith has assimilated all its inhabitants. The Smith with the Oracle's powers steps forth, claiming to have foreseen his victory. After a protracted battle, Neo baits Smith into assimilating him. The machine leader sends a burst of energy into Neo's body in the real world, causing all the Smiths in the Matrix to be destroyed. The Sentinels withdraw from Zion, Neo's body is carried away by the machines, and Morpheus and Niobe embrace.
The Matrix reboots, and the Architect encounters the Oracle in a park. They agree that the peace will last ""as long as it can"", and that all humans will be offered the opportunity to leave the Matrix. The Oracle tells Sati that she thinks they will see Neo again. Seraph asks the Oracle if she knew this would happen, and she replies that she did not know, but she believed.","opening action scene,robot,shootout,combat,welcome to the real world,matrix,learn,facing reality,telephone box,bleak,artificial reality,fist fight,kiss of life,mescaline,neo,artificial human,simulated reality,slavery,religion,computer,belly button,humanity in peril,technology gone amok,hypodermic needle,false reality,glitch,altruism,traitor,conflict,mixed martial arts,action hero,electro magnetic pulse,revolution,neo,post apocalypse,mma,code,guns,never send a human to do a machine's job,self sacrifice,oracle,2 of 3,time freeze,cubicle,buddhism,reincarnation,machine gun,red pill,sunglasses,artificial intelligence,trilogy,real world,nightclub,dodging bullets,fear,software,stylized,impossible,cyberspace,red dress,self sufficiency,tough guy,maya,slave,martial arts,one against many,agent,kung fu,free your mind,subterranean,hacker,2190s,bourgeois,ai,elevator,knife throwing,war against machines,neo noir,gatling gun,energy source,tech noir,hacker,computer program,virtuality,hero,sacrifice,cypher,reversal of power,authoritarian,escape,discipline,nationalism,warrior,human versus computer,computer hacker,first part,training,trace,chase on the roof,grim reality,sentinel,men in black,fate,beretta,abandoned subway station,woman with dark glasses,evolution,fictional war,transformation,punched in the face,king fu,rooftop chase,government agent,crops,gestapo,blue pill,brawl,telephone booth,falling from height,man versus machine,philosophy,hinduism,rebellion,belief,virus,true believer,lucid dream,rabbiot hole,plug in,chosen one,dream,dream sequence,human machine relationship,dojo,telephone,alice in wonderland,fascism,emp,22nd century,cyberpunk,fascist,pill,20th century,prophecy,radical,download,future,truth,miracle,bullet dodging,bullet time,simulation,violence,rescue,one man army,suspenseful,christianity,kung fu,showdown,advaita vedanta,hand to hand combat,trinity,cell phone,spoon,rayban,physical training,utopia,pill,flow motion,indoctrination,anticipation,mister andersen,handcuffs,slow motion scene,1990s,jumping,dream world,morphing,salvation,rough,war with machines,ringing telephone,alternative reality,torture,mainframe computer,roof chase,plato,lady in red,betrayal,flying man,questioning reality,christ allegory,black,parallel world,mentor,virus,oracle,believe,realization,messiah,wire fu,hit me,freedom fighter,future noir,gunfight,location,programmer,cyberspace,simulator,bullet time,what if,proletarian,energy,deception,contemplative,helicopter crash,virtual reality,reality,digital,alice in wonderland",705.jpg,2003-10-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-matrix-revolutions/id271469065?uo=4,Kw3IQpnVtvo,,,"Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
3571,The Mexican,"Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) is a low-level Mafia ""mechanic"" whose ineptitude is countered by frequent (but unpredictable) bursts of dumb luck. Jerry's girlfriend Samantha (Julia Roberts) wants him to get out of the business, and after his latest blunder lands capo Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman) in jail, so does mid-level crime kingpin Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). But Bernie insists that Jerry do one last errand for the mob before they let him find employment elsewhere ‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√ú he has to go to Mexico and recover a rare and very valuable pistol, which is said to be cursed. While Samantha objects to Jerry taking the assignment, he isn't in much of a position to argue; Jerry heads south of the border, while Samantha, in a huff, sets out for Las Vegas. Once in Mexico, Jerry finds the pistol easily enough, but making his way back to the States proves to be an unexpected challenge. Meanwhile, Jerry's superiors want insurance that he'll return with the goods, so they hire Leroy (James Gandolfini), a hitman, to kidnap Samantha and hold her hostage until Jerry comes back.","The story follows Jerry Welbach (Brad Pitt) as he travels through Mexico to find an antique gun, The Mexican, and smuggle it into the United States. Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). This will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), who constantly argues with him about, among other things, his lack of commitment to their relationship.

About five seconds after they close the door, the entire store shakes, as though it has been lifted several feet above the ground. When David is asked to check on the generator, he finds the loading dock door being pushed on by something outside. Then Dave hears a groan. He asks three people to come with him. When Norm the bag-boy volunteers to go out, he is dragged away by a creature with large squid-like tentacles that have mouths, teeth, and arms. After Dave and the other three fight off the tentacles, they warn everyone in the store what is out there. Upon hearing this, Mrs. Carmody exclaims that it is the End Time and that God is punishing them. People don't believe it, but finally Mrs. Carmody has almost everyone in the store on her side. Does 'Project Arrowhead' have anything to do with this? Will Dave Drayton, his son, and his friends make it out alive as they make a last stand against this destruction? Or will they be taken by the demon-like creatures of 'The Mist'?

Unable to bear Johnny's death, Dally robs a grocery store at gunpoint and is killed by police. Ponyboy is eventually cleared of wrongdoing in Bob's death and allowed to stay with his brothers. Turning the pages of Johnny's copy of Gone with the Wind, Ponyboy finds a letter from Johnny saying that saving the children was worth sacrificing his own life.

The gradual devolution from enthusiasm to resentment in the psyches of guys self-aware enough to notice it is an interesting process; in an attempt to distract themselves from the rapidly mounting bitterness, the attendants amuse themselves any way they can-stenciling random messages on the parking gate, writing songs, even dancing for tips. Through interviews with former attendants who have moved on - we see that their time at the lot has clearly provided rites of passage and afforded them Zen-like perspective. As one parking attendant laments, ""We had it all in a world that had nothing to offer us."" If the intersection between the status quo and the quest for freedom is their ultimate challenge, could a slab of asphalt be an emotional way station for The American Dream?

","The Parking Lot Movie is a documentary about a singular parking lot in Charlottesville, Virginia and the select group of Parking Lot Attendants that inhabit its microcosm. The Attendants are a uniquely varied group of men comprised of both undergraduate and graduate students, philosophers, intellectuals, musicians, artists, and marginal-type characters. Three years in the making, this documentary is a strange rite of passage for all involved. Themes receiving daily scrutiny and detailing include cars and license plates, capitalism, anger, justice, drunkenness, spiritual awareness, class struggle, entitlement, and working in the Service Sector. These all mesh together in the orbit of the Parking Lot Attendant. For these Parking Attendants, the intersection between the status quo and the quest for freedom becomes the challenge. Something as simple as a parking lot becomes an emotional way station for The American Dream. As one Attendant interestingly puts it, ""We had it all in a world that had nothing to offer us."" -- (C) Official Site

Hailed as the ""most feel-good film"" of the South by Southwest Film Festival, director Meghan Eckman's irreverently funny debut celebrates a brotherhood of eccentric attendants who man a unique parking lot in Charlottesville, Virginia. From grad students to middle-age slackers, indie-rock musicians to surly philosophers, these overeducated part-timers wax profoundly about car culture and capitalism, seek vengeance against entitled patrons and thieves, and make fun of drunken jerks. If the intersection between the status quo and the quest for freedom is their ultimate challenge, could a slab of asphalt be an emotional way station for The American Dream?

469,The Passion of the Christ,"THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST focuses on the last twelve hours of Jesus of Nazareth's life. The film begins in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Jesus must resist the temptations of Satan. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, Jesus is then arrested and taken within the city walls of Jerusalem where leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy and his trial results in a condemnation to death.","A film detailing the final hours and crucifixion of Jesus Christ.
A depiction of the last twelve hours in the life of Jesus of Nazareth, on the day of his crucifixion in Jerusalem. The story opens in the Garden of Olives where Jesus has gone to pray after the Last Supper. Betrayed by Judas Iscariot, the controversial Jesus--who has performed 'miracles' and has publicly announced that he is 'the Son of God'--is arrested and taken back within the city walls of Jerusalem. There, the leaders of the Pharisees confront him with accusations of blasphemy; subsequently, his trial results with the leaders condemning him to his death. Jesus is brought before Pontius Pilate, the Roman Governor of Palestine, for his sentencing. Pilate listens to the accusations leveled at Jesus by the Pharisees. Realizing that his own decision will cause him to become embroiled in a political conflict, Pilate defers to King Herod in deciding the matter of how to persecute Jesus. However, Herod returns Jesus to Pilate who, in turn, gives the crowd a choice between which prisoner they would rather to see set free--Jesus, or Barrabas. The crowd chooses to have Barrabas set free. Thus, Jesus is handed over to the Roman soldiers and is brutally flagellated. Bloody and unrecognizable, he is brought back before Pilate who, once again, presents him to the thirsty crowd--assuming they will see that Jesus has been punished enough. The crowd, however, is not satisfied. Thus, Pilate washes his hands of the entire dilemma, ordering his men to do as the crowd wishes. Whipped and weakened, Jesus is presented with the cross and is ordered to carry it through the streets of Jerusalem, all the way up to Golgotha. There, more corporal cruelty takes place as Jesus is nailed to the cross--suffering, he hangs there, left to die. Initially, in his dazed suffering, Jesus is alarmed that he has been abandoned by God his father. He then beseeches God. At the moment of his death, nature itself over-turns.

505,The Patriot,"In 1776 South Carolina, widower and legendary war hero Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) finds himself thrust into the midst of the American Revolutionary War as he helplessly watches his family torn apart by the savage forces of the British Redcoats. Unable to remain silent, he recruits a band of reluctant volunteers, including his idealistic patriot son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger), to take up arms against the British. Fighting to protect his family's freedom and his country's independence, Martin discovers the pain of betrayal, the redemption of revenge and the passion of love.","During the American Revolution in 1776, Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson), a veteran of the French and Indian War and widower with seven children, is called to Charleston to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army. Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains. Captain James Wilkins (Adam Baldwin) votes against and joins the Loyalists. A supporting vote is nonetheless passed and against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel (Heath Ledger) joins the Continental Army.
Some years later, Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from the nearby battle, before British Dragoons led by a ruthless Colonel William Tavington (Jason Isaacs) arrive and arrest Gabriel. When Benjamin's young son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who orders the Martins' house burned and wounded American regulars executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets and they ambush the British unit escorting a shackled Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of an almost unseen man rapidly killing the soldiers, earning Benjamin the moniker of the ""Ghost"". Benjamin and Gabriel resolve to fight the British, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte (Joely Richardson).
Benjamin meets with his former commanding officer Colonel Harry Burwell (Chris Cooper) and is given the rank of colonel to lead the local colonial militia due to his combat experience, tasked with keeping Lord Cornwallis's (Tom Wilkinson) British regiments pinned south through guerrilla warfare. French Major Jean Villeneuve (Tch‚àö¬©ky Karyo) helps train the militia and promises more French aid. Benjamin's militia harass British supply lines, capture goods including some of Cornwallis' belongings, and burn half the bridges and ferries leading to Charleston. Lord Cornwallis perceives these actions as uncivilized and blames Tavington for creating this reaction with his brutal tactics. Irritated at his lack of progress and insulted by Benjamin's clever ploy to free some of the captured militia, Cornwallis reluctantly allows Tavington to use whatever means necessary.
Tavington learns the identities of some of the militia members and proceeds to attack their families and burn their homes. Benjamin's family flees Charlotte's plantation as it is burned and settle on the coast in a Gullah settlement with former black slaves. There, Gabriel marries his betrothed Anne (Lisa Brenner) and Benjamin commits to Charlotte. Tavington's brigade, seeking Martin's secret hideout, rides into the town that supplies the militia. He assembes all the townspeople into the church, promising freedom for the location of the hideout. But after the location is given the doors are barricaded, trapping the people inside. Tavington orders a horrified Captain Wilkins to burn it, killing all inside including Anne and her family. After discovering the tragedy, Gabriel races to attack Tavington's encampment and is mortally wounded by him. Benjamin arrives to have his son die in his arms.
Benjamin mourns deeply and briefly wavers in his commitment to continue fighting, but is resolved when reminded of his son's dedication to the cause by finding an American flag he sewed together personally. Martin's militia, along with a larger Continental Army regiment, confronts Cornwallis' regiment in a decisive battle. The redcoats seemed to defeating the patriots until Benjamin rallies the troops to push forward against the British lines and Tavington personally targets him. The two dueled where Tavington's sword gain an upper hand over Martin's tomahawk. As Tavington prepares to finish him, Benjamin rises up with a musket, wounds him in the abdomen with the bayonet and delivers the coup de gr‚àö¬¢ce, avenging his sons' deaths. The battle is a Continental victory and Cornwallis is forced to retreat. After many retreats, Cornwallis is besieged at Yorktown, Virginia, where he surrenders to the surrounding Continental Army and the long awaited French naval force. After the conflict ends, Benjamin returns with his family and discovers his militia men rebuilding his homestead, previously destroyed by the British Soldiers, whose orders came from Tavington to burn it down.","rough,emotional,sincere,captivating,uplifting",505.jpg,2000-06-27,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-patriot/id263558852?uo=4 ,ZaTmxMc4PIw,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

2983,The Perfect Storm,"Emmy and Golden Globe-nominee George Clooney (""ER,"" ""Three Kings"") stars in this dramatic true story of the ill-fated crew of the Andrea Gail. Despite the heroic efforts of the fishing vessel's captain and crew and rescuers from the shore, all aboard perished in the fiercest storm of the 20th century. Outstanding ensemble cast includes Mark Wahlberg (""Three Kings,"" ""Boogie Nights""), Oscar and Golden Globe-nominee Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio (""The Color of Money""), Emmy-nominee Diane Lane (""Lonesome Dove""), John C. Reilly (""Magnolia""), Karen Allen (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") and Dash Mihok (TV's ""Felicity""). Directed by Oscar-nominee Wolfgang Petersen (""Air Force One,"" ""Outbreak""). Based on the best-seller by Sebastian Junger and adapted by multiple Oscar-winner Bo Goldman (""Scent of a Woman,"" ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"").","In October 1991, the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail returns to port in Gloucester, Massachusetts with a poor catch. Desperate for money, Captain Billy Tyne (Clooney), convinces the Andrea Gail crew to join him for one more late season fishing expedition. The crew head out past their usual fishing grounds, leaving a developing thunderstorm behind them. Initially unsuccessful, they head to the Flemish Cap, where their luck improves. At the height of their fishing the ice machine breaks; the only way to sell their catch before it spoils is to hurry back to shore. After debating whether to sail through the building storm or to wait it out, the crew decide to risk the storm. However, between the Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane, which the Andrea Gail crew underestimate.
After repeated warnings from other ships, the Andrea Gail loses her antenna, forcing Captain Linda Greenlaw (Mastrantonio) of sister ship Hannah Boden to call in a Mayday. An Air National Guard rescue helicopter responds, but after failing to perform a midair refuel, the helicopter crew ditch the aircraft before it crashes, and all but one of the crew members are rescued by a Coast Guard vessel, the Tamaroa. The Andrea Gail endures various problems: with 40-foot (12 m) waves crashing onto the deck, a broken stabilizer ramming the side of the ship, and two men thrown overboard. The crew decide to turn around to avoid further damage by the storm. After doing so, the vessel encounters an enormous rogue wave. Billy tells Bobby to apply full power to ride over the wave; it seems that they may make it over, but the wave starts to break and the boat flips over. Billy elects to go down with his ship, the rest of the crew are trapped and only Bobby manages to surface as he watches the boat go under; however, without a life jacket, he has no chance of surviving. He is last seen all alone among the waves. There are no survivors and the film ends with Linda reading the eulogy at the memorial service, followed by Christina and Bobby's mother, Ethel, consoling each other on the dock and Billy's voice soliloquising about what it means to be a swordboat captain.","exciting,bleak,suspenseful,overcome,tense,big wave,face your fears,rough,fear,go for it",2983.jpg,2000-06-26, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-perfect-storm/id322919751?uo=4,gVwuy-4TzU8,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

This powerful, triumphant film follows Szpilman's heroic and inspirational journey of survival with the unlikely help of a sympathetic German officer. A truly unforgettable epic, testifying to both the power of hope and the resiliency of the human spirit, The Pianist is a miraculous tale of survival masterfully brought to life by visionary filmmaker, Roman Polanski, in his most personal movie ever.","In September 1939, W‚âà√áadys‚âà√áaw Szpilman, a Polish-Jewish pianist is playing on Polish State radio in Warsaw when it is bombed during Nazi Germany's invasion of Poland at the outbreak of World War II. Hoping for a quick victory, Szpilman rejoices with family when learning that Britain and France have declared war. But Germany defeats Poland in just over a month. Very quickly life for Jews deteriorate as the Nazi authorities prevent them working or owning businesses, and force them to wear Star of David armbands.
By November 1940, Szpilman and his family have been forced from their home into the overcrowded Warsaw Ghetto where conditions only get worse. People starve, the guards are brutal and corpses are left in the streets. On one occasion, the Szpilmans witness the SS kill an entire family during a ‚âà√Öapanka (raid) in an apartment building across the street. In the summer of 1942, the family are deported to Treblinka extermination camp but Szpilman is saved at the Umschlagplatz by a friend in the Jewish Ghetto Police.
Szpilman becomes a slave labourer working on the ""Aryan"" side, where he survives a random mass execution. Szpilman learns of a coming Jewish revolt and helps by smuggling weapons into the ghetto, narrowly avoiding a suspicious guard. He then manages to escape and goes into hiding with help from non-Jewish friend Andrzej Bogucki and his wife Janina. In April 1943, Szpilman observes the rise and fall of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising from his window near the ghetto wall. A year goes by and Szpilman is forced to flee after a neighbor discovers him. In a second hiding place provided to him, he is shown into a room with a piano but forced to keep quiet, and suffers jaundice.
In August 1944, the Polish resistance attack a German building across the street from Szpilman's hideout in Ochoto district during the Warsaw Uprising. A tank shells his apartment forcing him to flee and hide elsewhere. Over the course of the next months the city is destroyed and emptied of the population. Szpilman is left to search desperately for shelter and supplies among the ruins. In one house, he is discovered by the Wehrmacht officer Wilm Hosenfeld, who learns that Szpilman is a pianist. Asked to perform by the German, the decrepit Szpilman plays Ballade in G minor on a grand piano. Hosenfeld, who was moved by the music, allows Szpilman to hide in the attic of the empty house. Over the coming months, the German officer regularly brings him food.
In January 1945, the Germans are forced to retreat due to the advance of the Red Army. Hosenfeld meets Szpilman for the last time promising he will listen to him on Polish Radio after the war. He gives Szpilman his greatcoat to keep warm and leaves. However this act has almost fatal consequences for Szpilman because he mistaken as a German and shot at by Polish troops liberating Warsaw.
In Spring 1945, former inmates of a Nazi concentration camp pass a Soviet prisoner-of-war camp holding captured German soldiers and verbally abuse them. One ex-prisoner says he used to be a violinist. On hearing this, the captured Hosenfeld asks the violinist if he knows Szpilman, which the violinist confirms. The German asks if Szpilman can return the favor. Later the violinist brings Szpilman back to the site but it is only a grassy field.
Later, Szpilman performs Chopin's Grand Polonaise brillante to a large and prestigious audience.","wall,mistaken identity,corpse,anti semitism,humiliation,world war two,assault rifle,gestapo,bleak,resistance,fire,ruins,pyre,existentialism,grand piano,brutal,hunger,starvation,red army,prisoner of war,zolty,musician,piano,ghettoization,underground resistance,loaf of bread,genocide,police brutality,survival,second chance,execution,hiding place,long suffering,passionate,change of heart,survival,losing weight,no opening credits,maestro,deportation,1930s,separation from family,atrocity,thrown through a window,murder,jewish,extreme suffering,keys,1940s,persistence,pen knife,loss of brother,violence,warsaw ghetto,holocaust,poland,piano concerto,desaturated colors,massacre,shot in the forehead,surviving,nazi occupation,pray,mass murder,wheelchair,grenade launcher,hospital,luck,concert,panzer,radio broadcasting,polish resistance,whipping,warsaw poland,kindness,molotov cocktail,budding friendship,nazi,war,captivating,faked death,chopin,ss,person in a wheelchair falls from height,freight train,war crime,nazi soldier,pogrom,fugitive from the nazis,pretending to be dead,killing someone in a wheelchair,nazi occupied poland,blood,loss of father,restaurant,emotional,pianist,contemplative,gloomy",2665.jpg,2002-05-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-pianist/id312923543?uo=4,CIRLLPa-j9o,,,Drama
2697,The Pipe,"A compelling documentary film four years in the making, The Pipe tells the story of the small Rossport community which has taken on the might of Shell Oil and the Irish State. The discovery of gas off this remote coastal village has led to the most dramatic clash of cultures in modern Ireland. The rights of farmers over their fields, and of fishermen to their fishing grounds, has come in direct conflict with one of the world's most powerful oil companies. When the citizens look to their State to protect their rights, they find that the government has put Shell's right to lay a pipeline over their own. Already 5 locals have spent 94 days in jail rather than let the proposed Shell pipeline cross their lands. This once tranquil area is engulfed in turmoil, as huge numbers of police drafted in. Normal policing has broken down following baton charges, surveillance, arrests, and a hunger strike by a local schoolteacher.","Rossport is a small town on the Western Coast of Ireland, where most men earn their living through fishing and people have a fiercely independent streak. The people of Rossport found themselves up against a powerful adversary when large reserves of natural gas were discovered nearby; Shell Petroleum obtained a lease on the gas and planned to build a high-pressure pipeline through Rossport to move it to their refineries. However, many of Rossport's citizens were strongly opposed to Shell's plans, and when the Irish government failed to stand up for the rights of their constituents, the locals began taking matters into their own hands. Filmmaker Risteard O Domhnaill was on hand to record the ongoing battle between Shell and the people of Rossport, and The Pipe is a documentary which concerns the oil company's efforts to build their pipeline, and the determination of the people of Rossport to stop it, including crab fisherman Pat O'Donnell, who puts his tiny ship in the way of Shell's massive vessels, and a quintet of local activists who become known in the press as ""The Rossport Five.""

2515,The Polar Express,"When a doubting young boy takes an extraordinary train ride to the North Pole, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery that shows him that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe.","On the night of Christmas Eve, a young boy who lives in Grand Rapids, Michigan, is hoping for belief in the true spirit of Christmas. He wakes up near midnight and when studying evidence of the existence of Santa Claus, the boy hears loud screeching sounds and runs outside. He sees newly blown steam reveal a magical train called the ""Polar Express."" The conductor tells him that the train is headed to the North Pole to go to meet Santa Claus, and that this is the year he should board it. He initially refuses, but hops on the train at the last second as it begins to move away from the neighborhood.
The boy encounters a group of other children aboard the train, including a young girl and a know-it-all. The train stops again, and a young boy named Billy replays the same events that happened with the protagonist, initially refusing, then running to catch up to the train. Unfortunately, Billy isn't fast enough and is thrown into snow by the train's speed. The protagonist finds this unfair and thinks Billy should get a chance to get on the train, so he pulls the emergency stop and Billy boards, although he enters a bit dejectedly into a carriage two carriages back. A sequence ensues with singing, dancing waiters serving hot chocolate and the girl hides some extra hot chocolate under her seat for Billy, then sneaks away into the back to give it to him. When the conductor asks for tickets from everyone so he can punch them, the boy discovers his ticket is miraculously in his pocket. The conductor forgets to punch the girl's ticket as he takes the girl to give more refreshments to Billy. The protagonist finds the girl's ticket and tries to give it to her so it can be punched. However, he loses the ticket in the wind. The girl comes back to find her ticket missing and the boy guiltily tells the conductor that he lost it, not her. The conductor then takes the girl up to the train's roof, and the kids assume that she will be thrown off. The boy finds that the ticket has miraculously flown back into the train, grabs it and climbs onto the train's roof to give the ticket to the girl but arrives to see the light of the conductor's lantern vanish in the darkness. He hikes across the train's roof until he meets a hobo, who gives him some Joe (Old-fashioned coffee). When the protagonist expresses his doubt that Santa is real, the hobo replies that ""Seeing is believing."" Afterwards, he helps him pursue the conductor and girl. They are forced to frantically ski down the train when the train is driving to enter Flattop Tunnel which has only one inch of clearance on the roof; just before they can be knocked off by the tunnel the boy hops in the engine as the hobo magically vanishes in the air.
The boy finds that the girl is actually driving the train. She explains that Steamer, the engineer, is trying to fix the train's light, so the conductor is letting her control it in the meantime. The light is fixed but they are forced to stop when thousands of caribou block the tracks. They restart their trip when the conductor comically gets the caribou to move, but unfortunately, he, the boy, and the girl are stuck in the front of the engine. The cotter pin of the throttle slips off causing the train to drive at a top speed out of control forcing the three to have to hope for survival as the train goes down the steepest downhill grade, Glacier Gulch. The train after going down the roller-coaster like gulch, lands on a frozen lake that has frozen over the railroad; and the ice begins to crack because the lost cotter pin rolls off the train and pierces the ice. The conductor has the train slowed down after Stoker, the fireman, uses a back-up cotter pin to re-attach the throttle, but when seeing the cracking ice behind them, the conductor orders the train to full-speed and they make it back on the railroad just before the ice completely cracks apart back into water.
They soon reach the North Pole and get off the train amid thousands of Christmas elves to see Santa and the magical Christmas tree. Billy stays in the train car; he does not want to see Santa, as he comes from a broken home due to a dissolved marriage from his parents' cultural differences. He says that Christmas never turns out well for him. The boy and girl try to get him to come along with them, but are trapped when the observation car speeds backwards. The three of them travel from section to section of the North Pole to get back to the town square, with guidance from the girl, who claims she hears the sound of bells that will show them the way if they follow the sound. Billy hears the bells as well but the boy realizes he can't hear them. Before long, they return to the town square and Santa appears. As his sleigh one of the bells fall off. The boy picks it up and shakes it, remembering that the girl and Billy could hear a bell earlier when he could not. As before, he cannot hear it. The boy then says he believes the spirit of Christmas and finally hears the bell. The boy is handpicked by Santa Claus to receive ""The First Gift Of Christmas."" Realizing that he could choose anything in the world, the boy asks for the beautiful-sounding silver bell (that only believers in Santa can hear). The boy places the bell in his pocket, and all the children watch as Santa takes off for his yearly deliveries.
As the children leave the North Pole and are each dropped off at their homes, the boy discovers the bell is missing because there was a hole in his pocket. He is saddened by the loss of his bell, but is happy when he sees Billy holding up his present at his doorway, meaning Santa visited him already.
On Christmas morning, the boy's sister, Sarah, finds a small present hidden behind the Christmas tree after all the others have been unwrapped. The boy opens the present and discovers that it is the bell, which Santa had found on the seat of his sleigh. When the boy rings the bell, both he and Sarah marvel at its beautiful sound; but because their parents don't believe in Santa Claus nor the spirit of Christmas, they do not hear it and remark it to be broken. The film's last line repeats the same last line from the book; the boy narrating years later:
""At one time, most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe.""","belief,joy,trust,christmas,stylized,bell,adventure,santa,touching,ice,snow,feel good,childhood,surprise",2515.jpg,2004-10-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-polar-express/id297817627?uo=4,ATUt_-p2XqM,,,"Animation,Drama,Kids & Family"
1668,The Prestige,"Award-winning actors Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson star in The Prestige, the twisting, turning story that, like all great magic tricks, stays with you. Two young, passionate magicians, Robert Angier (Jackman), a charismatic showman, and Alfred Borden (Bale), a gifted illusionist, are friends and partners until one fateful night when their biggest trick goes terribly wrong. Now the bitterest of enemies, they will stop at nothing to learn each other‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s secrets. As their rivalry escalates into a total obsession full of deceit and sabotage, they risk everything to become the greatest magician of all time. But nothing is as it seems, so watch closely. And be prepared to watch it again and again.","Magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is sentenced for the murder of rival Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Both were assistants for ""Milton the Magician"" (Ricky Jay) with ing‚àö¬©nieur John Cutter (Michael Caine). Angier's wife Julia (Piper Perabo) drowned performing a water cell act and Angier blames Borden, who professes not to remember if he had tied her with an inappropriate knot. The two become bitter competitors, disrupting each other's acts. Borden becomes ""The Professor"" with the enigmatic Bernard Fallon as his ing‚àö¬©nieur while Angier becomes ""The Great Danton"" with the lovely Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) and Cutter assisting. The magic trick from the beginning of the movie is explained: the original bird is crushed and replaced with a double. Angier is incensed when Borden meets and marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall) and they have a daughter, Jess (Samantha Mahurin). Angier sabotages Borden's bullet catch, costing Borden two fingers. Borden then ruins Angier's victimless bird cage act, maiming an audience member, killing the dove, and damaging Angier's reputation.
Borden soon begins performing an impressive trick called The Transported Man, where he enters one cabinet and exits another across the stage a moment later. Angier and Cutter argue over how it was done, with Cutter insists that Borden is using a double, an answer Angier refuses to accept. Angier begins performing his own version of the trick using a lookalike named Root (also Jackman). The act is a hit, but requires Angier to end up below the stage while Root receives the adoration of the crowd.
Angier sends Olivia to discover Borden‚Äö√Ñ√¥s secret, but she has grown tired of his obsession and betrays him to Borden, with whom she soon begins an affair. Olivia delivers an encoded diary of Borden's to Angier which supposedly contains the secret to his trick. Angier and Cutter kidnap Fallon to force Borden to give them the key to the cypher. Upon learning that the key word is ""Tesla"", Angier travels to Colorado Springs to meet with Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) and enlists the inventor to make a teleportation machine for him. Meanwhile, Borden's marriage has begun to fray due to his obsession with magic and Angier. After an angry confrontation, Sarah hangs herself.
Angier finishes deciphering Borden's diary to discover it's a fraud that Borden deliberately had Olivia give him. When a test of the machine appears to fail he angrily accuses Tesla of embezzling his money to pay for other experiments. However, he and Tesla soon discover that the machine works, just not as a teleporter. Instead it creates duplicates at some distance from the machine.
Angier returns to London, electrifying audiences with The Real Transported Man, vanishing within the machine and reappearing in the back of the hall. In reality, the machine creates a duplicate. The film doesn't clarify whether the original Angier is teleported or remains in the machine, but the one left in the machine falls through a trap door and plunges into a water cell, drowning. The tanks are disposed of by blind stage hands every night.
Borden witnesses Angier drown while snooping backstage and tries to save him but is caught and convicted of murder (in the opening of the film). In prison, Borden is visited by the agent of a Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for Borden's secrets. Borden is given Angier's diary, and finds his conviction has been orchestrated. When Lord Caldlow arrives to collect the secrets, Borden discovers he is actually Angier, somehow still alive. Borden attempts to give them but Caldlow rips them to pieces without reading them, before leaving with Jess. In a final visit, Borden tells Fallon to live for them both, and is hanged.
Cutter learns that Caldlow has bought all of Angier's tricks, including the machine, and visits Caldlow's estate to plead for its destruction. He recognises Angier, who admits he has always been Lord Caldlow, but pretended to be the American Robert Angier, to spare his family the embarrassment of his theatrical career. Cutter realises Borden's death was planned but, unable to have Caldlow come forward, accompanies him to store Tesla's machine beneath his theatre among the tanks previously used for the duplicates.
On his way out, Cutter recognises and nods to Fallon as Fallon enters and shoots Caldlow. Fallon's disguise removed, he tells the dying Caldlow that he and Borden were identical twins who shared their lives on stage and off. He removed the ends of his own fingers to duplicate Borden's injury and the two shared lovers to maintain the illusion of being a single man. Fallon reveals they each loved one woman. Borden loved their mistress Olivia, while Fallon loved their late wife Sarah. Caldlow reveals his machine's own trick, repeatedly recreating Julia's suffering in order to bask in the admiration of the crowd.
Borden leaves Caldlow/Angier to die as a fire consumes the building. The first scene of the film replays, with the magician (now known to be Cutter) vanishing (killing) the bird for the delight of the little girl (Jess). This time, the scene continues and Fallon/Borden appears to reclaim his daughter.","magician,sleight of hand,dying repeatedly,showmanship,wizard,prestige,stylized,top hat,revelation,trapdoor,illusion,disguise,anticipation,copy,obsession,clone,artificial human,duality,coin trick,mind bending,secret,carbon paper,illusionist,secret twin,surprise,double,carbon copy,identity swapping,rivalry,betrayal,impostor,inventor,magic trick,captivating,wand,faked death,mirror,twin,surprise ending,sacrifice,sabotage,twin brother,partner,backstage,devotion,doppelganger,tense,steampunk,magic,human duplication,duplicating machine,gallows,deceit,theatre,duplicate,magician's assistant,suspenseful,deception,spitting image,atmospheric,invention",1668.jpg,2006-10-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-prestige/id209960866?uo=4,a1AqrIkD7vU,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

As the grandfather reads the story, the action comes alive. The story is a classic tale of love and adventure as the beautiful Buttercup, engaged to the odious Prince Humperdinck, is kidnapped and held against her will in order to start a war, It is up to Westley (her childhood beau, now returned as the Dread Pirate Roberts) to save her.

","A sick boy (Fred Savage) is told a story by his grandfather (Peter Falk). The story is framed and occasionally interrupted by scenes of the reading.
A young woman named Buttercup (Robin Wright) lives on a farm in the fictional country of Florin. Whenever she gives her farmhand Westley (Cary Elwes) an order, he answers ""as you wish"" and happily complies. Eventually, she realizes he loves her and admits her love for him. Westley leaves to seek his fortune so they can marry, but his ship is attacked by the Dread Pirate Roberts, who has a reputation for never leaving anyone alive.
Five years later, believing Westley dead, Buttercup reluctantly agrees to marry Prince Humperdinck (Chris Sarandon), heir to the throne of Florin. Before the wedding, she is kidnapped by three outlaws: an extremely short Sicilian boss named Vizzini (Wallace Shawn), a Turkish giant that Vizzini discovered in Greenland named Fezzik (Andr‚àö¬© the Giant), and a Spanish master fencer named Inigo Montoya (Mandy Patinkin), who seeks revenge against the six-fingered man who killed his father. The outlaws are pursued by Prince Humperdinck with a complement of soldiers and also a masked man in black.
The man in black catches up to the outlaws at the top of the Cliffs of Insanity, where he first defeats Inigo in a duel before knocking him unconscious. He then defeats Fezzik in hand-to-hand combat by choking him from behind until he blacks out. Finally, he defeats Vizzini in a battle of the wits by tricking him into drinking from a poisoned chalice, and so he captures Buttercup. When he tells her he is Roberts, she becomes enraged at him for killing Westley and shoves him into a gorge after telling him that he should die too, but she realizes he is Westley himself when he replies ""As you wish!"" She dives into the gorge after him, and they flee through the dangerous Fire Swamp where they navigate past the R.O.U.S. (Rodents of Unusual Size), fire spouts, and lightning sand. When they are captured on the other side by Humperdinck and his sadistic six-fingered vizier Count Rugen (Christopher Guest), Buttercup agrees to return with Humperdinck in exchange for Westley's release, but Humperdinck secretly has Rugen imprison and torture Westley.
When Buttercup expresses unhappiness at marrying Humperdinck, he promises to search for Westley, but his real plan is to start a war with the neighboring country of Guilder by killing Buttercup and framing them for her death. After Buttercup realizes that Humperdinck has no intention of finding Westley, she taunts his cowardice and feelings of inferiority towards his romantic rival. Enraged, Humperdinck tortures Westley to his apparent death. Meanwhile, Inigo and Fezzik reunite, and Fezzik informs Inigo of Rugen's existence. Inigo decides that they need the help of the man in black to get into the castle, and when he hears cries of anguish (from Westley being tortured), he decides that they must be from the man in black and follows them. Inigo and Fezzik arrive in Rugen's torture chamber to find Westley dead, but they bring him to a miracle man named Miracle Max (Billy Crystal), who explains that Westley is ""only mostly dead,"" reviving him to a state of heavy paralysis.
Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik invade the castle, prompting Humperdinck to order a drastically-abridged version of the wedding ceremony, rushing Buttercup to her chambers. Inigo finds and duels with Rugen, and despite incurring heavy blood loss from a stab wound in the opening moments of the battle, he is able to maintain his focus by repeatedly reciting his long-rehearsed greeting of vengeance (""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."") and eventually slays his nemesis.
Westley finds Buttercup, who is about to commit suicide, and assures her that her marriage is invalid because she never said ""I do."" When confronted by Humperdinck, Westley bluffs his way out of a duel (due to his temporary paralysis) and has Humperdinck tied to a chair, left to contemplate his cowardice. Triumphant, he then rides away with Buttercup, Inigo, and Fezzik on four white horses that Fezzik conveniently discovers.
Westley and Buttercup share a passionate kiss. The grandfather then closes the book and prepares to leave, but the boy asks him to read the story again the next day. The grandfather smiles and replies, ""As you wish.""","quicksand,wizard,fezzik,giant,mask,grandfather grandson relationship,princess,drunkenness,paper cut,revenge,andre the giant,hope,poisoned drink,socrates,plato,gentle giant,anticipation,unrequited love,as you wish,kissing,fair maiden,parody,exciting,honor,true love,insult,pirate,buttercup,self worth,duel,lemon,secret identity,poison,left hand,revenge,fairy tale,evil prince,sword,joy,witty,prince,inigo montoya,friendship,fencing,kidnapping,prepare to die,fencing,offbeat,pirate,wrestling,westley,screwball,immune,aristotle,magic,extra finger,humorous,inconceivable,storyteller,masked man,swashbuckler,fairy tale,sword fight,coward,deception,touching,battle of wits,true love,sword and sorcery,feel good,spaniard,murder of father",3152.jpg,1987-09-18, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-princess-bride/id263952053?uo=4,VYgcrny2hRs,,,"Action & Adventure,Comedy,Kids & Family,Romance,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

3566,The Prophecy,"At the scene of a bizarre murder, L.A. homicide detective Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas  Exotica) discovers a lethal heavenly prophecy now being fulfilled on earth! Yet in his fight to stop the forces of evil  led by the powerful angel Gabriel (Walken)  Dagget finds an unlikely ally in an elementary school teacher (Virginia Madsen  Candyman). Together they race against time and terror to save the world as we know it! Also starring Eric Stoltz (Pulp Ficition)  critics everywhere praised The Prophecy for its high-powered thrills and knockout performances  don't miss it!","In the prologue, Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) is about to be ordained as a priest of the Roman Catholic Church, but he is stricken by horrific visions of angels at war with each other. Several years later, Thomas, having lost his faith and abandoned the church, is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon (Eric Stoltz), warns Thomas of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel (Jeff Cadiente), tracks Simon down and attempts to kill him, but is killed himself. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas goes to Simon's apartment and finds an obituary for a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Arnold Hawthorne clipped from a newspaper in Chimney Rock, Arizona. More puzzling, Thomas finds a copy of a theology text that he himself wrote years ago. In Chimney Rock, Simon finds the veteran and removes the soul from the body.
The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes a Twenty-Third chapter of the Book of Revelation - a chapter that does not exist in any other version. Thomas translates the chapter and learns of a second war in Heaven, instigated by a group of angels who refused to accept God's elevation of man over all other creatures, including angels. The chapter includes a prophecy that a ""dark soul"" will be found on Earth that can be used as a terrible weapon.
Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel (Christopher Walken) has arrived on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel recruits Jerry (Adam Goldberg), who has been trapped in a state of limbo ever since Gabriel prevented him from dying when he committed suicide. Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary among Simon's possessions, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, Simon befriends a little girl, Mary (Moriah Shining Dove Snyder), and passes the soul on to her in order to hide it from Gabriel. Mary immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine (Virginia Madsen).
After finding Uziel's immolated body, Thomas decides to go to Chimney Rock. Just outside of the town, Gabriel and Jerry locate Hawthorne's body, but the soul is gone. Gabriel locates Simon by scent and confronts him at the school; Simon refuses to tell him where he hid the soul. Gabriel says Hawthorne's soul will end the stalemate, tipping the balance to whichever side possesses it. Simon chastises Gabriel for going against the word of God, and finally Gabriel kills Simon by setting him aflame and ripping the heart from his chest. Mary begins showing signs of being possessed by Hawthorne's soul. Meanwhile, Thomas arrives in Chimney Rock, examines Simon's remains, and questions Katherine. He searches Hawthorne's home and finds evidence of a court martial in which Hawthorne was accused of a number of war crimes, including cannibalism. Thomas visits a church to reflect and is shaken by a confrontation with Gabriel.
Katherine arrives at school the next day to find Gabriel questioning the children. He leaves, and she rushes to Mary's home to find Thomas there. Mary's condition is worsening. Katherine takes Thomas to an abandoned mine where she saw Gabriel's car parked. Inside, they find angelic script on the walls and they experience a vision of a battlefield strewn with dead angels. Thomas and Katherine rush back to Mary's home. Gabriel and Jerry are there, and Gabriel is attempting to extract the soul. Thomas kills Jerry (much to Jerry's relief), and Gabriel is rendered unconscious when Katherine blows up Mary's trailer home by shooting a propane cylinder with Thomas' gun. ""Mary"" informs Thomas that angels aren't immortal on Earth; they can be killed by tearing out their heart. Thomas frantically calls for Gabriel's ""corpse"" to be cuffed and taken into custody, but Gabriel easily escapes. Katherine, meanwhile, takes Thomas and Mary to a Native American site where a ritual is to be performed to expel Hawthorne's soul from Mary. Gabriel recruits another ""assistant"", Rachael (Amanda Plummer), from the terminal unit of the ICU at a nearby hospital and threatens her with an eternity of living death unless she takes him to the site.
That night, as Mary starts to undergo her exorcism, Katherine is confronted by Lucifer (Viggo Mortensen) himself. Lucifer tells Katherine that ""other angels"" have taken up this war against mankind, and since then, no human souls have been able to ""meet their maker"". He knows of Gabriel's plot to use Hawthorne's soul to overthrow the agents of Heaven, and he knows that if Gabriel wins, his ""new"" Heaven will ultimately devolve into another Hell, resulting in unwanted competition. The next day, Lucifer appears to Thomas and laments to him about the true nature of Hell ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ the absence of the divine presence ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ and then advises him to use Gabriel's lack of faith as a weapon against him. When Gabriel arrives, Thomas accuses him of being jealous of humanity, and asks him why he doesn't simply take his case to God; Gabriel mournfully reveals that God no longer speaks to him. The angel attempts to disrupt the ritual, but is stopped by Thomas, who kills Rachael and then runs over Gabriel with a truck, then beats him into submission with a tire iron.
As the ritual continues, Lucifer appears and confronts Gabriel. He tells him the war is based on arrogance, which is evil ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ making it Lucifer's territory, not Gabriel's. Lucifer rips out a defiant Gabriel's heart and devours it. Once the tribal ancestors complete the exorcism. Hawthorne's soul is expelled from Mary and destroyed. With the threat eliminated, Lucifer asks Thomas and Katherine to ""come home"" with him, but they refuse. The film closes with Lucifer returning to Hell, and Thomas commenting on the nature of faith and what it means to truly be human.","scary,suspenseful,tense",3566.jpg,1995-03,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-prophecy/id432491734?uo=4 ,-ynKNaSkih4,,,"Horror,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
913,The Proposal,"Sandra Bullock is at her funniest in the fresh, laugh-out-loud romantic comedy The Proposal. On the verge of being deported and losing the high-powered job she lives for, the controlling Margaret (Bullock) announces she's engaged to her unsuspecting, put-upon assistant Andrew (Ryan Reynolds). After proposing a few demands of his own, the mismatched couple heads to Alaska, where they have four short days to convince his quirky family and a very skeptical immigration agent that their charade is real. Featuring a star-studded supporting cast, including Mary Steenburgen, Craig T. Nelson and the delightfully inappropriate Betty White, this madcap comedy will have you saying ""yes"" to The Proposal again and again.","Margaret Tate (Sandra Bullock) is the executive editor in chief of a book publishing company. After learning she is about to be deported to Canada because of an expired visa, she persuades her assistant, Andrew Paxton (Ryan Reynolds), to marry her. Mr. Gilbertson (Denis O'Hare), informs them that he suspects they are committing fraud to avoid Margaret's deportation. Gilbertson tells them that they'll be asked questions about each other separately. If their answers don't match, Margaret will be deported to Canada and Andrew will be convicted of a felony punishable by a $250,000 fine and five years in prison. Andrew insists that Margaret make him an editor after their marriage and publish his book. Margaret agrees.
The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska, Andrew's home town, to meet his family. Margaret meets Andrew's mother Grace (Mary Steenburgen) and grandmother Annie a.k.a ""Gammy"" (Betty White). During the trip to the family home, Margaret notices that nearly every shop in town carries the name Paxton and learns that Andrew's family is in fact very wealthy. During a welcome home party, Andrew confronts his father, Joe (Craig T. Nelson), who is angry about Andrew's dating the boss he has so long disliked and thinks he is using her to get ahead in his career. After their argument, Andrew announces the engagement to everyone. Margaret also meets Gertrude (Malin ‚àö√ñkerman), Andrew's ex-girlfriend. After the party is over, Grace and Gammy show Margaret and Andrew the bedroom they will share during the weekend.
The next day, Grace and Annie take Margaret to a local bar to watch a strip dance by a locally famous but over-the-hill exotic dancer, Ramone (Oscar Nunez). Stepping away from the show, Margaret learns from Gertrude that Andrew wanted to become an editor and make his own life and that Andrew had proposed to Gertrude. However, Gertrude refused because she didn't want to leave Sitka for New York. Returning home, Margaret learns of the conflict between Andrew and Joe. That night, Margaret asks Andrew about his relationship with his father, but Andrew refuses to talk. Instead, Margaret opens up to Andrew.
The next day, the family convinces them to marry while they're in Sitka. After Margaret realizes how close Andrew's family is, she becomes upset, gets on Andrew's boat, and speeds away from town with him. She tells him she has been alone since she was sixteen years old after her parents died and had forgotten what it felt like to have a family. She lets go of the helm and stumbles to the back of the boat. Andrew makes a sharp turn to avoid hitting a buoy, and Margaret falls out of the boat. Andrew quickly turns the boat around and saves her. At the wedding ceremony, Margaret confesses the truth about the wedding to the guests, including Gilbertson, who informs her she has twenty four hours to leave for Canada. Margaret returns to the Paxton home to pack her things. Andrew rushes to their room only to find Margaret has already left, leaving his book manuscript with a note of praise and a promise to publish it. Gertrude attempts to comfort Andrew and asks if he is going to go after her. As he rushes out of the house to find Margaret, another argument arises between him and Joe. Annie fakes a heart attack and convinces them to reconcile before she ""passes away"". Annie admits faking the attack. Andrew's parents realize he really loves Margaret. Andrew goes to New York and tells Margaret he loves her in front of the entire office staff. They kiss and then go to Gilbertson and inform him they are again engaged, but for real this time.","book,lv,louis vuitton,wealthy family,humiliation,witty,go after her,publisher,immigration officer,book editor,moral dilemma,workplace bullying,deportation,deal,editorial office,canadian stereotype,spilled coffee,struggling writer,whip,double entendre,forced,meant to be,ex girlfriend,fake engagement,resentment toward boss,one knee,sexual innuendo,fake marriage,fiance,humorous,cross examination,high school sweetheart,buoy,canadian expatriate,new york city,interview,naked,alaska,feel good,thumb,kennedy,role reversal",913.jpg,2009-06-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-proposal/id322466855?uo=4,RFL8b1p1ELY,,,"Comedy,Romance"

When the pair are young men, Putty Nose persuades them to join his gang on a fur warehouse robbery, assuring them he will take care of them if anything goes wrong. When Tom is startled by a stuffed bear, he shoots it, alerting the police, who kill gang member Larry Dalton. Chased by a cop, Tom and Matt have to gun him down. However, when they go to Putty Nose for help, they find he has left town.
Tom's straitlaced older brother Mike (Donald Cook) tries, but fails to talk Tom into giving up crime. Tom keeps his activities secret from his doting mother (Beryl Mercer). When America enters World War I in 1917, Mike enlists in the Marines.
In 1920, with Prohibition about to go into effect, Paddy Ryan (Robert Emmett O'Connor) recruits them as beer ""salesmen"" (enforcers) in his bootlegging business. He allies himself with noted gangster ""Nails"" Nathan (Leslie Fenton).
The bootlegging business becomes ever more lucrative, and Tom and Matt flaunt their wealth. However, when Tom gives his mother a large wad of money, Mike rejects the gift. Tom tears up the banknotes and throws them in his brother's face. When Mike states that Tom's success is based on nothing more than ""beer and blood"" (the title of the book upon which the film is based), Tom retorts: ""Your hands ain't so clean. You killed and liked it. You didn't get them medals for holding hands with them Germans.""
Tom and Matt acquire girlfriends, Kitty (an uncredited Mae Clarke) and Mamie (Joan Blondell) respectively. Tom eventually tires of Kitty; in a famous scene, when she complains once too often, he pushes half a grapefruit into her face. He then drops her for Gwen Allen (Jean Harlow), a woman with a self-confessed weakness for bad men.
When Nails dies in a horse riding accident, a rival gang headed by ""Schemer"" Burns takes advantage of the resulting disarray, precipitating a gang war. Matt is gunned down in public, with Tom narrowly escaping the same fate. Furious, Tom takes it upon himself to single-handedly settle scores with Burns and some of his men. He himself is seriously wounded in the shootout, and ends up in the hospital.
When his mother, brother and Matt's sister Molly come to see him, he reconciles with Mike and agrees to reform. However, he is kidnapped by the Burns mob from the hospital.

879,The Queen,"After the death of Princess Diana, HRM Queen Elizabeth II struggles with her reaction to a sequence of events nobody could have predicted.
Diana the 'People's Princess' has died in a car accident in Paris. The Queen and her family decide that for the best, they should remain hidden behind the closed doors of Balmoral Castle. The heartbroken public do not understand and request that the Queen comforts her people. This also puts pressure on newly elected Tony Blair, who constantly tries to convince the monarchy to address the public.

","In the 1997 general election, Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) becomes Britain's Labour prime minister. However, the Queen (Helen Mirren) is slightly wary of Blair and his pledge to modernise Britain, but he promises to respect the Royal Family. Three months later, Diana, Princess of Wales died in a car crash at the Alma Bridge tunnel in Paris. Blair's director of communications, Alastair Campbell (Mark Bazeley), prepares a speech in which Diana is described as ""the people's princess"". Blair gives his speech the next day and the phrase catches on. Within the next few days after Diana's death, millions of people across London display an outpouring of grief at Buckingham and Kensington Palaces. Meanwhile, the Royal Family are still at their summer estate in Balmoral Castle. Diana's death sparks division among members of the family, in which they observe that, since Diana was divorced from her husband, Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) a year earlier, she is no longer a part of the family. Diana's funeral arrangements were thus best left as a private affair of her noble family, the Spencers. Charles argues that the mother of a future king cannot be dismissed so lightly, while the Queen authorises the use of an aircraft of the British Royal Flight to bring Diana's body back to Britain.
In London, flowers pile up before the palace railings, forcing the changing of the Queen's guard to use another gate. British tabloids become inflammatory about the lack of a statement from the Royal Family. Charles leaves no doubt that he shares Blair's views about the need for a statement. As the Royal Family's popularity plummets, Blair's acceptance rises, to the delight of his anti-monarchist advisers and wife Cherie (Helen McCrory). However, Blair does not share these sentiments. While disagreeing with the Queen's course of action, Blair begins to develop an admiration for her. Blair also disagrees with his wife's views and tells her that a republican Britain is ludicrous and begins to denounce the anti-monarchical disdain of his Labour Party advisors. Blair immediately calls the Queen at Balmoral and recommends three strong measures to regain public confidence for the monarchy: attend a public funeral for Diana at Westminster Abbey, fly a Union flag at half-mast over Buckingham Palace, and speak to the nation about Diana's life and legacy in a televised address.
Blair's recommendations outrage several other members of the Royal Family including Prince Philip (James Cromwell) and the Queen Mother (Sylvia Syms). Philip is surprised that Elton John is asked to attend and sing a song, ""Candle in the Wind"" in Diana's memory. They view such steps as an undignified surrender to public hysteria. The Queen seems concerned about this and although she shares their feelings, she has doubts as she closely follows the news. The Queen believes that there has been a shift in public values and that perhaps she should abdicate. The Queen Mother dismisses the idea by saying that she is one of the greatest assets her monarchy has ever had, stating: ""The real problem will come when you leave"". She also reminds the Queen of the promise she made in Cape Town, South Africa on her 21st birthday, in which she promised that her ""whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service and the service of our great imperial family to which we all belong..."" Meanwhile, Philip attempt to distract William and Harry (Jake Taylor Shantos and Dash Barber) from Diana's death by taking them deer stalking. While venturing out alone in her classic Land Rover, the Queen damages the vehicle while crossing a river and is forced to telephone for assistance. The Queen weeps in frustration, but catches sight of a majestic red deer which Philip, William, and Harry have been stalking. She is struck by his beauty and the two stare at each other. Hearing a distant gunshot, she shoos the animal away and decides to carry out Blair's recommendations. While preparing to return to London to attend Diana's public funeral, the Queen is horrified to learn that the deer has been killed on a neighbouring estate, and asks to see the stag and is upset at its loss.
The Royal Family finally return to London to inspect the floral tributes and while watching live television coverage with his staff, Blair becomes angry and disappointed at his Labour Party advisors, in which he states that the Queen is admirable and Diana had thrown everything she offered back in her face and seemed to destroy everything held most dear by the Queen. The Queen later follows Blair's advice to make a public statement on live television, where she speaks about the life and legacy of Diana and describing her as ""an exceptional and gifted human being"". Two months after Diana's death, Blair visits Buckingham Palace to attend a weekly meeting with the Queen. The Queen finally regains her popularity, but she believes that Blair has benefited himself from her acquiescence to his advice and that she will never fully recover from ""that week"". The Queen cautions Blair that he will find that public opinion can rapidly turn against him and declares that times have changed and that the monarchy must modernise. When Blair suggests that he can help with this, the Queen replies: ""Don't get ahead of yourself, Prime Minister. Remember, I'm supposed to be the one advising you"".","her majesty,queen,scottish accent,thought provoking,jubilee award,paparazzi,london england,buckingham palace,proper,dog lover,tower of london,1990s,politician,princess diana,buckingham palace london,monarchy,scottish highlands,hm queen elizabeth ii,westminster abbey london,portrait sitting,queen of scots,queen of england,british royal family,speech,kilt,queen elizabeth ii,mother son relationship,queen,crown,prime minister,cup of tea,monarchy,flower,majesty,england,castle,corgi,ma'am,captivating,great britain,decorum,posh,for queen and country,ascot,deer,sincere,majesty,funeral procession,etiquette,royalty,contemplative",879.jpg,2006-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-queen/id432474556?uo=4,204,,,Drama
7294,The Raid: Redemption,"A SWAT team becomes trapped in a tenement run by a ruthless mobster and his army of killers and thugs.
In Jakarta, Indonesia, Lieutenant Wahyu organizes the invasion of an apartment building that is the safe house of the powerful and cruel drug lord Tama and his gang. The SWAT team breaks in the building but one lookout sees and warns the gangsters and the police force is trapped on the seventh floor. They learn that Lt. Wahyu has not informed his superiors about the operation. Now the police officers have to fight with limited ammunition against the armed and dangerous gangsters.

","Early in the morning, Rama, an expectant father and rookie officer, and a 20-man Detachment 88 special police squad led by Sergeant Jaka and Lieutenant Wahyu, arrive at an apartment block in Jakarta's slums undetected. It is run by Tama Riyadi, a crime lord, who is the target of the task force. While detaining various tenants of the apartment, the team eventually detains a man who is delivering medicine to his sick wife in room 726. However, before the team enters the apartment, he escapes. The team infiltrates the apartment block floor by floor until they reach the sixth floor. However, the team is seen by a young lookout, who raises the alarm before he is shot and killed.
Tama calls in reinforcements, who systematically take out a majority of the police and regain control of most of the building. Tama turns off the power to the building's central stairwell. He announces over the building's PA system that the police are trapped on the sixth floor and he will grant free permanent residence to those who kill the intruders. In the darkness, the team is soon ambushed by shooters from above, as well as others who flank them from behind. During the battle, Jaka learns from Wahyu that the mission isn't sanctioned by the force, meaning nobody knows their location and no backup or reinforcements will arrive. The team backs into an empty apartment from the stairwell, where Bowo is shot and injured. They narrowly escape after Rama improvises an explosion that kills the pursuing tenants. With more antagonists approaching, the team is forced to split into two groups covertly; Jaka, Wahyu, and Dagu retreat to the fifth floor, while Rama and Bowo ascend to the seventh.
Rama and Bowo make their way to the apartment of the man with the sick wife, who reluctantly agrees to hide them despite his wife's pleas not to get involved. They hide in a secret passage behind a wall. A gang arrives and inspects the man's apartment, but they find no one, and leave. After removing the bullet stuck in Bowo, Rama leaves him in the care of the couple as he goes out in search of the others. Rama is eventually captured by Andi, Tama's right hand man. At the same time, Jaka and his group are found by Mad Dog, Tama's ruthless henchman. Wahyu makes his escape, but Jaka orders Dagu to follow him. Armed with only a knife, Jaka is confronted by Mad Dog, who holds him at gunpoint and leads him into an apartment unit. There, he disarms and challenges Jaka to a fight with no weapons. After a brutal fight, Jaka is subdued and Mad Dog kills him. Meanwhile at Andi's apartment, it is revealed that he is Rama's estranged brother, and that Rama's personal hidden objective throughout the mission was to find him and bring him home. Andi is uninterested in leaving, but he advises Rama to wait briefly until it is safe to escape the area. Andi meets up with Mad Dog, who drags Jaka's body to Tama. Tama learns of Andi's betrayal from the closed-circuit camera footage of Andi pulling Rama to safety in his apartment. Tama stabs Andi in the hand before turning him over to Mad Dog.
Rama regroups with Wahyu and Dagu, who go on to fight Tama's henchmen in a narcotics lab, and then to the 15th floor where Tama is located. On the way up, Rama finds a room where Andi is being beaten by Mad Dog. As Rama enters, Mad Dog allows him to free Andi and prepares to fight them both. Rama and Andi team up against Mad Dog, and after sustaining more brutal beatings, kill him. Meanwhile, Wahyu and Dagu confront Tama, but Wahyu shoots and kills Dagu. Wahyu is convinced that holding Tama hostage will allow him to escape. Rama and Andi run into Wahyu and Tama, but Wahyu fires at them. While Wahyu keeps the two at bay, Tama gloats that his actions are futile because of extensive corruption on the police force. After realizing the depth of the corruption and the inevitability of his own murder, Wahyu shoots Tama in the head. He then attempts to shoot himself, but fails because he has run out of bullets. Andi gives Rama a list of corrupt officers that Tama had kept as insurance. Rama again asks Andi to come home, but he refuses, due to his acclimation to his lifestyle. Andi claims that he will always be able to protect Rama in his role as a criminal boss, but that Rama cannot do the same for him. He then orders the guards at the gate to allow the officers to leave and returns to the apartment, while Rama leaves with Bowo and a detained Wahyu.","crime lord,climb,emergency exit,suspense,high rise,drug factory,drug lord,gangster,elevator,extreme violence,lieutenant,take the stairs,martial art,stairs,floors,tough guy,fight,indonesian,police raid,police,apartment,corrupt cop,gas tank,swat team,punched in the stomach,multi storey,kick ass,security camera,pregnant wife,tenement,staircase,kung fu,rookie cop,apartment building,jakarta indonesia",7294.jpg,2012-05-18,,My02wp9fsho,,,Action & Adventure

Eight years later, while Michael is a law student observing the Nazi war crime trials, he is stunned to find Hanna back in his life - this time as a defendant in the courtroom.

","The Reader begins in 1995 Berlin, where Michael Berg (Ralph Fiennes), a lawyer, is preparing breakfast for a woman who spent the night with him. After she leaves, Michael watches an U-Bahn pass by, flashing back to a tram in 1958 Neustadt[disambiguation needed]. A 15-year-old Michael (David Kross) gets off because he feels sick and wanders the streets, pausing in the entryway of a nearby apartment building where he vomits. Hanna Schmitz (Kate Winslet), a tram conductor, comes in and helps him return home.


Michael (Kross) reads to Hanna (Winslet).
Michael, diagnosed with scarlet fever, rests at home for the next three months. After he recovers, he visits Hanna with flowers to thank her. The 36-year-old Hanna seduces him and they begin an affair. They spend much of their time together having sex in her apartment and Michael reading her literary works he is studying, such as Emilia Galotti, The Odyssey, The Lady with the Little Dog, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and the Tintin comic The Seven Crystal Balls. After a bicycling trip, Hanna learns she is being promoted to a clerical job at the tram company. She abruptly moves without telling Michael.
The film switches to Michael at Heidelberg University law school in 1966. As part of a special seminar taught by Professor Rohl (Bruno Ganz), a camp survivor, the students observe a trial (similar to the Frankfurt Auschwitz Trials) of several women accused of letting 300 Jewish women die in a burning church when they were SS guards on the death march following the 1944 evacuation of a concentration camp near Krakow. Hanna is one of the defendants.
Stunned, Michael visits a former camp himself. The trial divides the students, with one angrily saying there is nothing to be learned from it other than that evil acts occurred and that the older generation of Germans should kill themselves for their failure to act then.
The key evidence is the testimony of Ilana Mather (Alexandra Maria Lara), author of a memoir of how she and her mother, who also testifies, survived. Hanna, unlike her co-defendants, admits that Auschwitz was an extermination camp and that the ten women she chose during each month's Selektion were gassed. She denies authorship of a report on the church fire, despite pressure from the other defendants, but then admits it rather than complying with a demand to provide a handwriting sample.
Michael then realizes Hanna's secret: she is illiterate and has concealed it her whole life. The other female guards who claim she wrote the report are lying to place responsibility on Hanna. Michael informs Rohl that he has information favorable to one of the defendants but is not sure what to do since the defendant herself chooses not to disclose the information. Rohl tells him that if he has learned nothing from the past there is no point in having the seminar.
Hanna receives a life sentence for her admitted leadership role in the church deaths while the other defendants are sentenced to four years and three months each. Michael meanwhile marries, has a daughter and divorces. Retrieving his books from the time of the affair with Hanna, he begins reading them into a tape recorder. He sends the cassette tapes and a recorder to Hanna. Eventually, she begins to check the books out from the prison library and teaches herself to read and write by following along with Michael's tapes. She starts writing back to Michael in brief, childlike notes.
Michael does not write back or visit, but keeps sending tapes, and in 1988 a prison official (Linda Bassett) telephones him to seek his help with Hanna's transition into society after her upcoming release. He finds a place for her to live and a job and finally visits Hanna a week before her release. In their meeting, Michael remains somewhat distant and confronts her about what she has learned from her past. Michael arrives at the prison on the date of Hanna's release with flowers. He discovers that Hanna hanged herself and left a tea tin with cash in it with a note asking Michael to give the cash and some money in a bank account to Ilana.
Michael travels to New York. He meets Ilana (Lena Olin) and confesses his relationship with Hanna. He tells her about the suicide note and Hanna's illiteracy. Ilana tells Michael there is nothing to be learned from the camps and refuses the money. Michael suggests that she donate the money to an organization that combats adult illiteracy, preferably a Jewish one. She wants him to take care of this instead, though she wryly notes ""illiteracy isn't much of a Jewish problem."" Ilana keeps the tea tin since it is similar to one stolen from her in Auschwitz.
The film ends with Michael getting back together with his daughter Julia at Hanna's grave and beginning to tell her his story.","age difference,classmate,playing footsie,haunted by the past,jew,world war two,university,eating,slip the undergarment,bleak,looking at self in mirror,library,reading to someone,stamp collection,nudity,adolescent,literacy,latin the language,loss of virginity,protest,reading aloud,confession,kiss,16 year old,justice,gravestone,two in a bath,telephone call,year 1958,new york city,coming of age,class,lady chatterley's lover,bicycle,stamp album,love,bed,book,locked in,death,integrity,reading,demonstration,fear,barbed wire,tears,crying,graveyard,learning to read,pride,year 1966,asking for forgiveness,conscience,sexual awakening,surprise,brother sister relationship,law,father son relationship,concentration camp,court,flashback,jail,flash forward,shame,murder,swimming,flowers,voyeur,absolution,west berlin west germany,snow,1940s,mirror,suitcase,student,cigarette smoking,trial,embarrassment,walking in the rain,law professor,german,germany,false accusation,legality,teacher,teacher student relationship,berlin germany,suicide,lie,first love,lawyer,heidelberg law school,post world war two,women's prison,dining hall,male frontal nudity,tape recorder,shared bath,snowing,heidelberg germany,female lawyer,false confession,school,sexually aggressive woman,wine,seminar,obsessive love,prison visitation,washing hands,year 1995,photograph,reference to the odyssey,swimsuit,1980s,hamburg germany,uniform,tram,courtroom,secret,microphone,learning to write,prison library,burning to death,bra,pen and paper,writing,withholding evidence,courthouse,skinny dipping,tape recording,virginity,writing a poem,coitus,bath,war atrocity,neustadt germany,bathtub,chekhov,mother son relationship,postage stamp,morality,tea tin,alienation,teenage boy,israel,nazi,studying,nylon stockings,mother daughter relationship,classroom,friendship,ss,auschwitz,vanity,crime against humanity,reading a comic book,teaching one's self to read,survivor,male nudity,law student,war crime,sexual,mail,stamp collector,15 year old,female nudity,crematorium,high school,voice over narration,poem,female prisoner,goethe,divorce,teenage girl,oven,guilt,father daughter relationship,last will and testament,philately,teaching one's self to write,locked door,jail visitation,contemplative,apology,listening to music,illiteracy,gloomy",2943.jpg,2008-12-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-reader/id308031025?uo=4,sFd488Dg0KU,,,"Drama,Romance"
550,The Recruit,"James Clayton might not have the attitude of a typical CIA recruit, but he is one of the smartest graduating seniors in the country - and he's just the person that Walter Burke wants in the Agency. James regards the CIA's mission as an intriguing alternative to an ordinary life, but before he becomes an Ops Officer, James has to survive the Agency's secret training ground, where green recruits are molded into seasoned veterans. As Burke teaches him the ropes and the rules of the game, James quickly rises through the ranks and falls for Layla, a fellow recruit. But just when James starts to question his role and his cat-and-mouse relationship with his mentor, Burke taps him for a special assignment to root out a mole.","James Clayton (Colin Farrell), a computer programming expert at MIT, is recruited by senior Central Intelligence Agency instructor Walter Burke (Al Pacino) to test for a position with the Agency. After witnessing an extraordinary demonstration of Clayton's computer skills, Burke further tests the intelligence of Clayton with an open puzzle encoded on the sports page of a common newspaper, the solution of which gives to Clayton Burke's telephone number. Clayton agrees to be recruited, in part, to find information concerning his father who he suspects was a CIA operative that disappeared when Clayton was a child. After passing numerous psychometric, psychoanalytical, aptitude, and polygraph tests, Clayton is taken to The Farm, a CIA training facility. There, Burke and other instructors teach the candidates the skill sets of espionage, covert operation protocols, and intelligence gathering techniques. During a surveillance exercise, Clayton and fellow recruit Layla Moore (Bridget Moynahan) are kidnapped by men apparently from a foreign intelligence service.
Clayton is brought to an isolated cell and tortured for several days but refuses to give up the names of his CIA instructors. When the interrogators provide evidence that his defiance is contributing to Layla's suffering, Clayton relents and names Burke. The rear wall of the cell then opens to reveal Burke, Layla, and the other recruits sitting in the lecture theater at The Farm, having witnessed the entire event; the kidnapping being just another training exercise. Clayton is cut from the program, but Burke arrives at his hotel the next morning to advise Clayton his dismissal was a fake and he has been appointed to be a non-official cover (NOC) operative. Burke assigns Clayton to spy on Layla, claiming the CIA has evidence she's a mole for a foreign intelligence service attempting to steal a top secret computer virus from the CIA's database. Clayton is provided a job as a low-level CIA data-entry processor and enters a romantic relationship with Layla. He eventually uncovers proof that she is removing the virus piece-by-piece using a USB flash drive.
Clayton surveils Layla as she brush-passes a note to her contact and follows the man through the Union Station. After a brief scuffle, Clayton kills him and discovers the contact is Zack (Gabriel Macht), a CIA agent who had also been a recruit at The Farm. When confronted with the evidence, Layla explains to Clayton she was officially sanctioned to test the security protocols of CIA headquarters by attempting to remove a fake virus, and Zack was a NOC agent. Clayton, by virtue of his familiarity with computer programs, is skeptical and reports his suspicions to Burke who initially congratulates Clayton on passing ""the final test."" Burke is caught in a lie, however, when he tries to convince Clayton his gun is loaded with blanks. Clayton fires a shot proving otherwise but flees when Burke knocks the gun from his grip. Burke then chases Clayton through an abandoned warehouse, and boasts that he organized the entire scheme to sell the virus for $3 million. Held at gunpoint, Clayton agrees to hand over the virus, only to show that he has been broadcasting Burke's admission from his laptop back to CIA headquarters. Burke becomes incensed and chases Clayton outside to find a S.W.A.T. team had assembled.
Unbeknownst to Burke, Clayton's broadcast did not work and a fake broadcast was displayed. The CIA were there to arrest Clayton and had no knowledge of Burke's treachery. Believing to be caught, Burke rails at his unjust treatment by the CIA, allowing the agents to conclude that Burke is the traitor. Burke then realizes he incriminated himself and draws his gun; committing suicide-by-cop. Afterward, Layla consoles Clayton before he heads back to CIA headquarters for debriefing. On the drive to Langley, Virginia, Assistant Director of Operations Dennis Slayne (Karl Pruner) makes a comment alluding that Clayton's father was a NOC agent when he died.","florida atlantic university,liar,lie,psychological testing,double agent,diplomatic corps,surveillance,massachusetts institute of technology,espionage,college graduate,exam,test,taxi,trust,lie detector,cheating on a test,covert,protégé,video surveillance,computer trade show,breaking and entering,drink,embassy,recruitment, john dillinger,rough,abu nidal,anger,torture,cambridge massachusetts,traitor,falklands,recruiter,surprise,surrogate father,betrayal,farsi,beating,mentor,cia,toilet,covert operative,diplomatic immunity,u.s. capitol building washington d.c.,protegé,data entry,kidnapping,mentor protégé relationship,denny's,disk drive,bethesda maryland,spartacus,washington d.c.,apprentice,recruitment,spy,police,mit,cafe,murder,protégé,computer virus,foolow that cab,mole,shell oil company,trust,cat and mouse,langley virginia,boston massachusetts,recruit,government agent training,police academy,usb,suspenseful,deception,firing range,spy training,jefferson memorial washington d.c.,nightclub,smithsonian institute washington d.c.,job fair,exploitation,union station washington d.c.,rifle,miami florida",550.jpg,2003-01-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-recruit/id299020594?uo=4,-aqecRSJo3o,,,"Action & Adventure,Mystery & Suspense"

1659,The Road,"A post-apocalyptic tale of a man and his son trying to survive by any means possible. Father and son journeying together toward the sea across a post-apocalyptic American landscape, some years after a great, unexplained cataclysm has destroyed civilization and almost all life on Earth.
Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind and water. It is cold enough to crack stones, and, when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the warmer south, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing: just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless cannibalistic bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a rusting shopping cart of scavenged food--and each other.

","A man and his young son struggle to survive after an unspecified cataclysm has apparently killed all plant and animal life. Civilization has collapsed, reducing the survivors to scavenging, and in some cases, cannibalism. They search for supplies as they travel south on a road to the coast in the hope it will be warmer. The man carries a revolver, but has only two bullets.
A series of flashbacks reveals that the man's wife had given birth to the child shortly after the catastrophe. She eventually committed suicide.
After shooting a member of a gang who inadvertently stumbles upon them, the man is left with only one bullet. Later, exploring a large mansion, the pair discover prisoners in the basement; serving as a food supply for their absent captors. When the armed cannibals return, the man and his son hide. With discovery imminent, the man prepares to shoot his son, but the cannibals are distracted by the captives, and the pair get away.
Further down the road, they discover an underground shelter full of canned food and supplies. They feast, bathe and groom themselves. When the man hears rummaging noises around the entrance to the shelter, he decides they must leave. They later encounter a nearly-blind old man (Duvall) on the road. The son persuades his reluctant father to feed him something.
Arriving at the coast, the man goes to scavenge what he can from a beached ship. He leaves his son to keep watch, but the boy falls asleep and they are robbed of everything. After they chase the thief down, the father takes everything from him, even his clothes. When the boy remains upset about what is essentially a death sentence, the father relents. They go back, but cannot find the thief, so they leave behind his clothes and a can of food.
As they pass through a ruined town, the man is shot in his right leg with an arrow. He kills his ambusher with a flare gun he found on the ship, but is so weakened by the wound that they have to abandon their cart and most of their possessions. When his condition deteriorates, he realizes he is dying. He again emphasizes to his son the values of self-preservation and humanity.
After the father dies, the son is approached by a man who gives him the choice of joining him, a woman, their two children and their dog. The family had followed the pair for some time out of concern for the boy. The child joins them after being assured they are the ""good guys"".","hanged man,corpse,abandoned building,loss of wife,abandoned farmhouse,suicide,cart,dying,zero,cross,edge of reason,nothing left,memory,abandoned church,coughing blood,bleak,trust,empty,jack daniels,hope,starvation,thief,hanging,down on one's luck,robbery,captive,nothing,dystopia,road movie,over the edge,nonlinear timeline,journey,despair,desolation,rough,homelessness,survivalism,suffering,scavenger,whiskey,beach,apocalypse,running on empty,humanity,bleakness,death,fear,pistol,abandoned house,desperation,cannibalism,survival,post apocalypse,no hope,del monte canned fruit,inhumane,chase,malnutrition,bomb shelter,tipping point,hopeless,suicide contemplation,flashback,old man,mistrust,skinny,murder,future,on the road,shopping cart,ocean,snow,blindness,boy,violence,childbirth,cataclysm,cannibal,suspenseful,end of the world,canned food,contemplative,head on a stake,so close,skeleton,gloomy",1659.jpg,2009-09-03, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-road/id369853725?uo=4,hbLgszfXTAY,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

2312,The Robber,"A champion marathon runner leads a double life as a serial bank robber, sprinting between heists (and away from police cars) as many as three times a day. Based on the real-life story of Johann Kastenberger (changed to Rettenberger for the film), Austria's most-wanted bank robber of the 1980s, Benjamin Heisenberg's thriller is a lean, visceral study of pathological compulsion, featuring a riveting central performance by Andreas Lust (REVANCHE). Known as ""Pump-gun Ronnie"" because of his weapon and the Ronald Reagan mask he slips on during stickups, Rettenberger is portrayed here as an obsessive loner, more concerned with his lap times than other human beings. Once he falls into a relationship with his social worker, Erika (Franziska Weisz), it becomes impossible to hide his crimes, and the violence he reserved for his robberies starts seeping into his daily life. Misguided in his dual search for love and freedom, the authorities finally begin to close in on the robber. Moved by an over- powering inner energy, he attempts to flee the largest deployment of police forces in Austria‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂¬¨‚Ä¢s modern history, but will his wit and athleticism give him the opportunity for one last escape? Ending in an epic chase over highways and through the woods, The Robber is a thriller about reckless bank robberies, heart-pounding marathons, ill-fated love and dramatic escapes.","Directed by Benjamin Heisenberg (Sleeper) and starring established actor Andreas Lust (Revanche), The Robber is slated to open in New York City on April 29, 2011, at the Lincoln Plaza and Cinema Village. The film will expand to other US and Canadian markets during the spring and summer of 2011. Based on a novel by the Austrian author Martin Prinz, and shot on location in Vienna, The Robber was one of the most critically acclaimed films featured at last year's New York Film Festival. The film was also an official selection at the 2010 Berlin and Toronto Film Festivals. The film's main character, Johann Rettenberger, was inspired by the life of Austrian bank-robber and runner Johann Kastenberger, a man who set records in long-distance races while - in the rest of his free time - secretly knocked over bank after bank. Widely referred to as ""Pump-gun Ronnie,"" after the Ronald Reagan mask he wore and the shotgun used on the assaults, Rettenberger still holds the record time in the Bergmarathon, a famous race held in the Austrian Alps. Deprived of by-the-books psychological motivations and character development, The Robber paints a visceral picture of pathological compulsion and it is the rare character portrait that also excels as an action film. -- (C) Kino",,2312.jpg,2010-02,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-robber/id471617980?uo=4 ,iIgT3RVsZHQ,,,"Drama,Sports & Fitness"

Sanderson is one of a growing number of American entrepreneurs who are determined to convert Puerto Rico into a capitalist paradise in service of the wealthy. When Kemp is recruited by Sanderson to write favorably about his latest unsavory scheme, the journalist is presented with a choice: to use his words for the corrupt businessmen's financial benefit, or use them to take the bastards down. -- (C) FilmDistrict","journalist,tipsy,drunk,tab,newsroom,alcoholic,pissed,hunter s. thompson,newspaper editor,hermaphrodite,cocktail,tourist,bar,heavy drinking,sloshed,carnival,man in swimsuit,reporter,rum,happy hour,beer,alcohol,profanity,hallucination,newspaper reporter,jamaica,pub,horoscope,investor,newspaper,bacardi,pure grain alcohol,alcohol abuse,gambling,pina colada,alcoholism,lsd,legless,refracting telescope",1541.jpg,2011-10-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-rum-diary/id494846837?uo=4,0YUx36yLLug,70120340,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/The_Rum_Diary/70120340,"Action & Adventure,Comedy,Drama"
7329,The Runaways,"A coming-of-age biopic about '70s teenage band The Runaways.

In 1975, San Fernando Valley teen Joan Larkin reinvents herself as Joan Jett, a guitarist who wants to form an all-girl punk band. She pitches the idea to a sleazy manager, Kim Fowley, who pairs her with a drummer and then searches for a face: he finds Cherie Currie, at 15 the perfect jailbait image for his purpose; by luck, she can sing. Two others round out the band, ""The Runaways."" Fowley books a tour, signs them to Mercury Records, and packs them off to crowds in Japan. Seeds of conflict sprout early: Fowley puts Cherie front and center in the publicity, she's soon strung out on pills and vodka, and jealousies arise. Without adult supervision, where can Joan and Cherie end up?

You can keep your Baby, Posh, Sporty and Scary. 

Before sanitised girl power there was The Runaways, an all-girl band formed in 1975 by 16-year-old Joan Jett, who played as hard and fast as the guys, opening doors for chicks laying down licks. At GCSE age, these girls were touring the world, shocking audiences and wearing the hell out of leather before the inevitable sex and drugs got in the way of the rock n' roll. It's a story worth telling, then, and former music video director Floria Sigismondi is keen to sell the she-wolf howl The Runaways represented in an era of testosterone-fuelled rock. 

From the opening image of a drop of menstrual blood to lingering shots of '70s fashion porn that would make a Topshop devotee weep, it's clear this film's aimed at girls. And for the most part it works, thanks to painstaking recreations of hazy disco-era dive bars, faded roller rinks and seedy motels, plus a ballsy performance by Kristen Stewart. Hunched hungrily over her axe, dirty-sexy and growling her lines, she won't please the Twi-hards, but it's a welcome switch-up for anyone suspecting talent does indeed lurk among the vampires. 

Michael Shannon also entertains as the manager who sees the bucks to be made from rock bitches'. Meanwhile, Dakota Fanning does her best to move from moppet to maven as lead singer Cherie Currie, but fails to convince fully despite a parade of saucy outfits. Apart from some evocative scenes of the band performing (with creditable singing from Stewart and Fanning) and being mobbed in Japan.

Though Jett's the more interesting character, she plays second fiddle to Cherie (the screenplay's based on Currie's memoir), a tease when her story would surely have delivered a more satisfying emotional arc than the tale of one valley girl's burnout.

Stars: Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, Michael Shannon","Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) is a teenager in Los Angeles, California who desperately wants to be a rock star. She idolizes David Bowie and cuts her hair and dons make-up so she will resemble Bowie's Aladdin Sane character. At her high school talent show, she lip syncs to ""Lady Grinning Soul"" and, despite some hecklers in the audience, wins. Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) is a bisexual teenager who also dreams of rock stardom. At a club one night, she meets record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) and talks about starting an all-girl rock band. Kim is interested. He introduces Joan to Sandy West (Stella Maeve), a drummer. Joan and Sandy become friends and start jamming when Kim suggests that they recruit a hot blonde in the vein of Brigitte Bardot.
Kim and Joan comb Los Angeles' clubs to look for hot blondes and discover Cherie. They invite her to audition at a trailer park in the San Fernando Valley. Cherie learns Suzi Quatro's ""Fever"" and goes to audition, but the band is disappointed at her choice of song. Instead, Kim and Joan write ""Cherry Bomb"", on the spot for Cherie to perform at her audition. Cherie sings it and, after improving, is part of the band, named the Runaways, joined by Lita Ford (Scout Taylor-Compton) on lead guitar and Robin (Alia Shawkat) on bass. (Robin is a fictional character created for the movie because Jackie Fox, the original bassist, refused usage of her name).[2]
The Runaways are soon signed to Mercury Records and release an album. Due to the album's success, they travel to Japan to play a concert. After their performance, Lita throws magazines at Cherie that have pictures of her. Cherie is shocked because she thought the articles were to cover the whole band. As Lita, Cherie, and Joan argue, overenthusiastic fans break through the window and chase the girls out of the building. Cherie's drug problems worsen. She overdoses in the hotel, collapses in an elevator and is sent to the hospital. Upon arriving back in the United States, Cherie begins to abuse her alcoholic father's painkiller medication.
At the studio recording their next album, Cherie has a mental breakdown and refuses to play. Lita insults her, and though Joan defends her, Cherie quits the band. Joan is outraged, and the Runaways are finished. Cherie returns home while Joan starts her own band, Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Cherie collapses again in a phone booth in a supermarket parking lot. At the hospital, her sister Marie visits her and tells her to straighten herself up.
A few years later, Cherie is working in a bakery and hears Joan's cover of ""I Love Rock 'n' Roll"" on the radio and calls the station, where Joan is visiting for interviews. After an awkward conversation between Joan, Cherie, and radio host Rodney Bingenheimer (Keir O'Donnell), Cherie says her goodbyes and continues working, smiling when Joan's next song, ""Crimson and Clover"", comes on the radio.","cherie currie,laurie mcallister,rock band,promiscuity,joan jett,music business,recording studio,rock group,stage performance,music industry,girl band,band practice,rock 'n' roll,drums,iggy pop,rock star,teen,microphone,rock music,band member,rock musician,classic rock music,drummer,talent show,fame,musician,guitar player,microphone,coming of age,female rocker,singer, jackie fox,stage,singing,air guitar,micki steele,rock singer,teenage,recording artist,rock concert,music concert,music producer,sex pistols,guitar playing,girlband,vicki blue,guitarist,guitar,talent contest,friend,band,sandy west,recording,teenage sexuality,lita ford,limousine,drug use,listening to music,tour,music group",7329.jpg,2010-04-08,,,,,"Musical & Performing Arts,Drama"

Fox proves it can be done in this very funny lampoon of corporate business life. Fresh out of college, he's determined to climb New York's corporate ladder in record time by masquerading as an up-and-coming executive, even though he's really the new mail boy. However, Fox's plans begin to go awry when the boss's wife falls in love with him and he falls in love with a junior executive, who also happens to be the boss's mistress.","Brantley Foster (Michael J. Fox) is a recent graduate of Kansas State University who moves to New York City where he has landed a job as a financier. Upon arriving, he discovers that the company for which he is supposed to work has been taken over by a rival corporation. As a result, Brantley is laid off before he even starts working.
After several unsuccessful attempts to get another job, mostly because he is either overqualified or underqualified and has little experience, Brantley ends up working in the mailroom of the Pemrose Corporation, which is directed by his uncle, Howard Prescott (Richard Jordan), the CEO. Pemrose was founded by Prescott's father-in-law; Howard received presidency of the company by marrying his boss's daughter, Vera Pemrose (Margaret Whitton).
Upon inspecting company reports, Brantley realizes that Prescott and most of his fellow ""suits"" (executives) are making ineffective and/or non-beneficial decisions. After Brantley notices an empty office in the building, due to one of Howard's frequent firings, he assumes the identity of Carlton Whitfield, a new executive.
While handling two jobs (switching between casual wear and business suits in the elevator), Brantley also falls head-over-heels for Christy Wills (Helen Slater), a fellow financial wizard who recently graduated from Harvard. Brantley meets Vera after driving her home in a company limo (at his employer's request). Vera persuades Brantley to stay for a swim and seduces him. Upon seeing Prescott arriving, Brantley and Vera realize they are related (albeit not by blood). Brantley then gets changed as fast as he can and leaves the mansion without being seen by Prescott.
Prescott, without Brantley's knowledge, is having an affair with Christy. When Howard asks her to spy on Carlton Whitfield, Christy falls head-over-heels for Carlton, not knowing he is actually Brantley. The Pemrose Corporation is preparing to merge with the infamous Davenport Corporation. Prescott, unaware that Whitfield and Brantley are one and the same person, suspects Carlton is a spy for corporate raider Donald Davenport (Fred Gwynne).
In the end, Brantley and Vera raise enough cash, bonds, and stocks to wrest ownership of the Pemrose Corporation from Prescott, and to proceed with a hostile takeover bid of Davenport's Corporation. Vera, already contemptuous of Howard for his counter-productive business practices, which were driving her father's empire into the ground, learns that Prescott has been cheating on her to boot. She promptly replaces him with Brantley. While security guards escort Howard and his aide, Art Thomas (Gerry Bamman), from the Pemrose Building, Brantley and Christy start planning their future together, personal as well as professional.","succeed in life,successful people,joy,trust,witty,humorous,successful people vs unsuccessful people,feel good,successful,wishbone,anticipation,success,backbone",3425.jpg,1987-04-10, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-secret-of-my-success/id280616578?uo=4,9cJfO32QnvA,,,Comedy

2548,The Social Network,"On a fall night in 2003, Harvard undergrad and computer programming genius Mark Zuckerberg sits down at his computer and heatedly begins working on a new idea. In a fury of blogging and programming, what begins in his dorm room soon becomes a global social network and a revolution in communication. A mere six years and 500 million friends later, Mark Zuckerberg is the youngest billionaire in history... but for this entrepreneur, success leads to both personal and legal complications. From director David Fincher and screenwriter Aaron Sorkin comes The Social Network, a film that proves you don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies. The film is produced by Scott Rudin, Dana Brunetti, Michael De Luca, and Ce‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√†√ªn Chaffin and based on the book ""The Accidental Billionaires"" by Ben Mezrich.","In 2003, Harvard University student Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is dumped by his girlfriend Erica Albright (Rooney Mara) at a bar. He returns to his dorm drunk and writes a blog entry about her. This inspires him to create an on-campus website called Facemash which allows users to rate the attractiveness of female students using photographs pilfered from various university systems. Mark receives six months of academic probation after traffic to the site crashes parts of Harvard's network. Facemash's popularity and the fact that Mark created it in one night while drunk brings him to the attention of Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss (both portrayed by Armie Hammer) and their business partner Divya Narendra (Max Minghella). The Winklevoss twins invite Mark to their final club, where Mark accepts a job as programmer for a proposed dating website they call Harvard Connection which will be exclusive to Harvard alumni.
Mark approaches his friend Eduardo Saverin (Andrew Garfield) and tells him of his idea for what he calls ""Thefacebook"", an online social networking website exclusive to Harvard University students. He explains that this would mimic the popularity of FaceMash but since signing up would be consensual it would avoid the ethical problems of the earlier site. Eduardo agrees to help Mark, providing $1,000 to help start the site. They distribute the link to Eduardo's connections at the Phoenix S-K final club, and it becomes popular throughout the student body. When they learn of Thefacebook, the Winklevoss twins and Narendra believe Zuckerberg has stolen their idea while stalling on their website. Tyler and Divya want to sue Mark for intellectual property theft, but Cameron convinces them to settle the matter as ""Gentlemen of Harvard"".
During a visiting lecture by Bill Gates (Steve Sires), fellow Harvard University student Christy Lee (Brenda Song) introduces herself and her friend Alice (Malese Jow) to Eduardo and Mark and asks the boys to ""Facebook me"". Christy's use of this phrase impresses both of them. Christy invites them to a bar, where Mark runs into Erica, who is not aware of Thefacebook because she is not a Harvard student. Mark tries to apologize for the Facemash incident, but Erica coldly rebuffs his attempts to make amends. As Thefacebook grows in popularity, Mark decides to expand the site to Yale University, Columbia University and Stanford University, while the Winklevoss twins and Narendra watch ""their idea"" advance without them. Cameron refuses to sue them, instead accusing Mark of violating the Harvard student Code of Conduct. Through their father Howard's (John Hayden) connections, they meet with Harvard President Larry Summers (Douglas Urbanski), who is dismissive towards the twins and sees no potential value in either a disciplinary action or in Thefacebook website itself.
Through Christy, now Eduardo's girlfriend, Eduardo and Mark arrange a meeting with Napster co-founder Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake). Eduardo becomes skeptical, noting Sean's problematic personal and professional history. Sean presents a vision for Facebook very similar to that of Mark, which earns Mark's instant admiration. In a parting comment, Sean suggests they drop the ""The"" from Thefacebook, saying it looks cleaner without the 'The'.
At Sean's suggestion, Mark moves the company to Palo Alto while Eduardo remains in New York seeking advertising support. Sean advises Mark to keep hold of his ownership of Facebook to ensure that Mark does not lose control of a potentially lucrative business venture. After Sean promises to expand Facebook to two continents, Mark invites Sean to live at the house he is using as the company headquarters.
While competing in the Henley Royal Regatta for Harvard, the Winklevoss twins discover Facebook has expanded to Oxford, Cambridge and LSE, and footage of their lost rowing race final against the Hollandia Roeiclub is posted on it. Cameron relents and they decide to sue. When Eduardo visits from New York, he is angered to find Sean living in their house and making business decisions for Facebook. Eduardo argues with Mark, with Mark making a demeaning remark regarding Eduardo's failed attempts to find advertisers. Eduardo freezes the company's bank account out of anger and returns to New York.
Eduardo has been dismayed to learn that his girlfriend Christy is ""psychotic,"" as he terms it. Upon his return to New York, Christy angrily confronts Eduardo about his Facebook profile, which lists him as ""single"". She refuses to believe Eduardo when he reluctantly explains that he does not know how to change his profile. She accuses him of cheating on her and sets fire to a scarf he gave to her as a gift. While Eduardo extinguishes the fire she caused, Mark reveals on the phone that although he was upset that Eduardo almost jeopardized Facebook by freezing the bank account, they have secured $500,000 from angel investor Peter Thiel (Wallace Langham). Eduardo breaks up with Christy and returns to California.
While visiting the new headquarters for a meeting, Eduardo discovers the deal he signed with Sean's investors has allowed them to dilute his share of the company from 34% to 0.03%, while maintaining the ownership percentage of all other parties. He confronts Mark and announces his intention to sue him. During a party celebrating Facebook's one millionth member, Sean and a number of underage Facebook interns are arrested for possession of cocaine. Sean tries deceiving Mark into believing that he had nothing to do with the incident and that Eduardo stashed the cocaine, but Mark does not believe him and tells him to ""go home"".
The story is intercut with scenes from depositions taken in lawsuits against Mark and Facebook‚Äö√Ñ√Æone filed by the Winklevoss twins, the other by Eduardo. The Winklevoss twins claim that Zuckerberg stole their idea, while Saverin claims his shares of Facebook were unfairly diluted when the company was incorporated. At the end, Marylin Delpy (Rashida Jones), a junior lawyer for the defense, informs Mark they will be settling with Eduardo, since the sordid details of Facebook's founding and Mark's callous attitude will make him highly unsympathetic to a jury. After everyone leaves, Mark sends a friend request to Erica Albright on Facebook, and refreshes the page every few seconds waiting for a response.
An epilogue reveals the following information: Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss received a settlement of $65 million, signed a non-disclosure agreement, and rowed in the 2008 Beijing Olympics, placing sixth; Eduardo Saverin received a settlement of an unknown amount and his name was restored to the Facebook masthead as a Co-founder of Facebook; the website has over 500 million members in 207 countries and is valued at 25 billion dollars; and Mark Zuckerberg is the world's youngest billionaire.","opportunist,hotornot,socialmedia,friends,siliconvalley,opy,social,facebook,friendship,laptop,geek,rude,contract,billionaire,awkward,rowboat,like,startup,e mail,girlfriend relationship,misogyny,deception,stanford university,zuck,narcissism,deposition,anger,poke,webgeek,socially awkward,surprise,internet,theaccidentalbillionaires,friend,wall,computer,hot or not,joy,critically mass,witty,computer hacker,blog,hacker,captivating,investment,business tycoon,fraternity,network,algorithm,disgust,paranoia,lawsuit,betrayal,tipping point,geeks,mistrust,popularity,post,bilionaire,tagging,social graph,trust,computer crash,breaking up with girlfriend,web,cambridge massachusetts,fb,manipulation,entrepreneur,social network,hacking,drop out,clever",2548.jpg,2010-09-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-social-network/id405665335?uo=4,2RB3edZyeYw,,,Drama
3800,The Sound of Music,"A woman leaves an Austrian convent to become a governess to the children of a Naval officer widower.
In 1930's Austria, a young woman named Maria is failing miserably in her attempts to become a nun. When the Navy captain Georg Von Trapp writes to the convent asking for a governess that can handle his seven mischievous children, Maria is given the job. The Captain's wife is dead, and he is often away, and runs the household as strictly as he does the ships he sails on. The children are unhappy and resentful of the governesses that their father keeps hiring, and have managed to run each of them off one by one. When Maria arrives, she is initially met with the same hostility, but her kindness, understanding, and sense of fun soon draws them to her and brings some much-needed joy into all their lives -- including the Captain's. Eventually he and Maria find themselves falling in love, even though Georg is already engaged to a Baroness and Maria is still a postulant. The romance makes them both start questioning the decisions they have made. Their personal conflicts soon become overshadowed, however, by world events. Austria is about to come under the control of Germany, and the Captain may soon find himself drafted into the German navy and forced to fight against his own country.

Director:
 Robert Wise
Writers:
 Howard Lindsay, Russel Crouse
Stars:
 Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Eleanor Parker
","In a high mountain pasture above Salzburg, Austria, a young woman named Maria (Julie Andrews) finds musical inspiration in the stunning beauty of the surrounding Alps (""The Sound of Music""). Living as a postulant at Nonnberg Abbey, Maria is constantly getting into mischief to the consternation of the nuns and the Mother Abbess (""Maria""). After receiving a request from a widowed Austrian naval captain for a governess for his seven children, Mother Abbess asks Maria to accept the position, and Maria reluctantly agrees (""I Have Confidence"").
When she arrives at the von Trapp estate, Maria discovers that Captain Georg von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) keeps it in strict shipshape order, uses a whistle to summon his children, issues orders, and dresses his children in sailor-suit uniforms. Although initially hostile toward her as with their previous governesses the children warm to her when she comforts them during a thunderstorm (""My Favorite Things""). The oldest child, Liesl (Charmian Carr), who is ""Sixteen Going on Seventeen"", sneaks into Maria's window after a secret rendezvous with a messenger boy, Rolfe (Daniel Truhitte). At first she is adamant that she ""doesn't need a governess"", but Maria offers to be her friend, and she acquiesces. In the coming days, Maria teaches the children how to sing (""Do-Re-Mi"") and to play, making playclothes for them from the old drapes in her room.
Meanwhile, the Captain welcomes a visit from a lady friend, Baroness Elsa Schroeder (Eleanor Parker), a wealthy socialite from Vienna, and a mutual family friend Max Detweiler (Richard Haydn), who is intent on finding a novel musical act for the upcoming Salzburg Festival. The Captain is not pleased to learn that Maria has been taking the children on picnics and bicycle rides, climbed trees, and going on boat rides on the lake at the estate. After watching the boat capsize upon its return throwing Maria and the children into the water in the clothes made from old curtains he confronts Maria in anger. When she begs him to pay attention to the children and love them, he furiously orders her to return to the abbey.
When the Captain hears the children singing ""The Sound of Music"" for the Baroness, he apologizes to Maria and begs her to stay grateful that she's brought music back into his home. Maria agrees, and soon she and the children perform a puppet show (""The Lonely Goatherd"") at the house. When Max announces that he has entered the children in the Salzburg Festival, the Captain forbids their participation. Maria and the children encourage him to sing a song, knowing he used to sing and play guitar. With his loving family listening, the Captain sings ""Edelweiss"".
Some time later, the Captain organizes a banquet in honor of Baroness Schroeder. As eleven-year-old Kurt (Duane Chase) watches the guests dancing the Laendler, he asks Maria to teach him the steps. When he sees Maria dancing in the moonlight, the Captain cuts in and partners her in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Maria breaks away and blushes, confused about her feelings. Later, the children perform ""So Long, Farewell"" to say goodnight to the guests. Afterwards, the Baroness, jealous of Maria, convinces her to return to the abbey.
Back at the abbey, Maria keeps herself in seclusion until Mother Abbess gently confronts her, urging her to ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" in search of God's will for her. Maria returns to the von Trapp family. When she discovers that the Captain is now engaged to the Baroness, she agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. Soon, the Captain breaks off the engagement, realizing that he is in love with Maria. At the gazebo, they declare their love for each other, and the two share a romantic kiss (""Something Good""). Soon after, the two are married in an elaborate ceremony in the cloister church at Mondsee, with many of Austria's elite, as well as the nuns from Nonnberg Abbey, in attendance (""Maria (reprise)"").
While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon in Paris, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Music Festival against their father's wishes. Austria has also been annexed into the Third Reich in the Anschluss. When they return, the Captain is informed by telegram that he must report as soon as possible to the German Naval Headquarters in Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the German Navy. Strongly opposed to Nazism, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria.
As the von Trapp family attempts to leave during the night, they are stopped by Nazi guards outside their estate. They tell the guards that they must perform that night in the Salzburg Festival. Hans Zeller (Ben Wright), the recently appointed Nazi Gauleiter, agrees to accompany them to the hall, but insists that the Captain depart for Germany immediately after the performance. Later that during, during their final number, ""So Long, Farewell"", the family escapes with the help from Max.
The von Trapp family seeks shelter from the patrolling guards at the abbey cemetary, but are soon discovered by Rolfe now a proud Nazi who threatens to shoot the Captain. The Captain is able to disarm the boy, who then calls for help.

1175,The Special Relationship,"They were two of the most powerful leaders of the free world who forged a loyal, if tempestuous, friendship out of the crucible of political necessity. Michael Sheen and Dennis Quaid star in the HBO Films drama that chronicles the 'special relationship' shared by British prime minister Tony Blair and U.S. president Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Their wives Hillary Clinton and Cherie Blair (Hope Davis and Helen McCrory) complete a unique foursome connected by shared ideologies and personal affection as they endure triumph, conflict and scandal along the way. Directed by Emmy(R) winner Richard Loncraine ('Band of Brothers'); written by Oscar(R) nominee Peter Morgan ('Frost/Nixon,' 'The Queen').","A dramatization that traces former U.K. prime minister Tony Blair's relationships with Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
In 1992 Labour leader Tony Blair goes to America and is impressed by the policies of President Clinton,which he uses to reshape his party. Two years later he is invited back for an audience with Clinton,who,rightly, predicts that he will be Britain's next Prime Minister.Thus begins the 'special relationship' between the two, though Clinton is clearly the senior partner with Blair seeking his advice on Northern Ireland. The situation in Kosovo however reverses the roles as Blair forces American intervention by a reluctant president and is seen in the American media as the hero of the hour. As Clinton accuses his ally of stabbing him in the back the special relationship starts to sour and,with Clinton ultimately out of the White House,Blair takes his first photo call with the next incumbent,Bush.
Screenwriter Peter Morgan (Frost/Nixon, The Queen) explores the complex relationship that developed between former American President Bill Clinton and former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair as the two progressive statesmen strived to unite their countries toward a common goal. The growing bond between President Clinton and Prime Minister Blair is later solidified by the fact that their wives, Hillary Clinton and Cherie Blair, seem to have just as much in common as their powerful husbands. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi

7254,The Spectacular Now,,"Sutter Keely (Miles Teller) lives in the now. It’s a good place for him. A high school senior, charming and self-possessed, he’s the life of the party, loves his job at a men’s clothing store, and has no plans for the future. A budding alcoholic, he’s never far from his supersized, whisky-fortified thirst-master cup. But after being dumped by his girlfriend, Sutter gets drunk and wakes up on a lawn with Aimee Finicky (Shailene Woodley) hovering over him. She’s different: the nice girl who reads science fiction and doesn’t have a boyfriend. While Aimee has dreams of a future, Sutter lives in the impressive delusion of a spectacular now, yet somehow, they're drawn together.
This adaptation of Tim Tharp’s novel The Spectacular Now captures the insecurity and confusion of adolescence without looking for tidy truths. Young actors rarely portray teens with the maturity that Teller and Woodley display, and they are phenomenal together. THE SPECTACULAR NOW is a funny, compassionate and poignant look at young adulthood, written by (500)DAYS OF SUMMER scribes Scott Neustadter and Michael H.

1796,The Spiderwick Chronicles,"From the beloved, best-selling series of books comes an extraordinary fantasy adventure, revealing the unseen world that exists all around us. From the moment the Grace family moves into a secluded old house peculiar things start to happen. Unable to explain the accidents and strange disappearances, the Grace children, Jared, Simon and Mallory start to investigate and find the unbelievable truth of the Spiderwick Estate and the amazing creatures that inhabit it.","Recently divorced Mrs. Grace (Mary-Louise Parker) moves into the Spiderwick Estate with her children when it is given to her by her elderly aunt Lucinda (Joan Plowright), though identical twins Jared and Simon (Freddie Highmore) and their older sister Mallory (Sarah Bolger) do not want to move from the city. When Jared uncovers a dumbwaiter system behind a wall, Jared finds a monogrammed key and discovers the study of the late owner of the estate, Arthur Spiderwick (David Strathairn). Jared uses the key to open a chest. In it, he finds Spiderwick's field guide to faeries; although an attached note warns him not to read it, he does so anyway.
Soon after, Jared meets a brownie named Thimbletack (Martin Short), who explains that magical creatures are normally invisible, but can reveal themselves at will. He tells Jared about a protective circle that Arthur Spiderwick placed around the house and gives him a stone with a hole through which he can see faeries.
However, a shape-shifting ogre named Mulgarath (Nick Nolte) wants the field guide for himself so he can rule over all faerie-kind. He sends his goblins led by Redcap the Pompous Goblin General, to obtain it, and they kidnap Simon, mistaking him for Jared. Meanwhile, Jared meets Hogsqueal (Seth Rogen), a hobgoblin and bitter enemy of Mulgarath. Hogsqueal gives Jared the ability to see faeries without the aid of the stone. Mulgarath lets Simon go and berates Redcap for failing his master. But soon Jared, who is hiding, is spotted by the goblins. Together, the twins flee to the house, managing to escape only with Mallory's help.
The children decide to visit their great-aunt Lucinda, now in a psychiatric hospital, for advice. While Simon distracts the goblins, Mallory and Jared manage to reach a tunnel under the estate. Lucinda tells them that they need to find Arthur Spiderwick and have him destroy the book; however, Arthur is being held captive by Sylphs, a type of faerie. Suddenly, Mulgarath's goblins attack them and steal several pages from the book before they are driven off. Meanwhile in the woods, Mulgarath berates Redcap violently for not bringing all of the book, but he is pleased by having a page that allows Mulgarth to break the protective circle by moonrise. Mulgarath and Redcap prepare the potion for the upcoming night. Meanwhile on the children's return, Hogsqueal warns them that one of the stolen pages will allow Mulgarath to destroy the protective circle when the moon rises.
Jared and Simon, along with Mallory use the book to summon Arthur Spiderwick's pet, a griffin, which takes them to the realm of the Sylphs. There they meet Arthur, who has not aged but is also unaware of the time he has spent there. After returning home again, Jared, Simon, Mallory, and Helen arm themselves with steel knives and home-made bombs prepared by Simon. When they are forced into the kitchen, they place all of their bombs into the oven, detonating them and killing all of the goblins and Redcap.
Mr. Grace (Andrew McCarthy) enters the house and tells Jared that he came to apologize. Jared, realizing that it is not his father, stabs him in the stomach, revealing him to be Mulgarath in disguise. Jared escapes with the book through the dumbwaiter while Mulgarath gives pursuit. On the roof, Jared throws the book onto the lawn; as Mulgarath transforms into a raven to catch it, he is snatched and eaten by Hogsqueal.
The Graces bring Lucinda back to the house, and the Sylphs appear, bringing Arthur. He cannot remain outside of the faerie realm, but Lucinda asks to be taken with him instead; the Sylphs transform her back into her six-year-old self and spirit the two away.","exciting,humorous,anticipation,trust,fear",1796.jpg,2008-01-31, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-spiderwick-chronicles/id277902299?uo=4,UjaNEpgdM-Q,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

2398,The Sting,"Winner of 7 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, The Sting stars Paul Newman and Robert Redford as two con men in 1930s Chicago. After a friend is killed by the mob, they try to get even by attempting to pull off the ultimate ""sting."" No one is to be trusted as the twists unfold, leading up to one of the greatest double-crosses in movie history. The con is on!","Johnny Hooker, a grifter from Depression-era Joliet, Illinois, cons $11,000 in cash from an unsuspecting victim, with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago, to teach him ""the big con"". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker‚Äö√Ñ√¥s cut. Having already spent his cut, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.
When Hooker asks Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding out from the FBI, to take on the dangerous Lonnegan, he is initially reluctant. However, he relents and decides to resurrect an elaborate and supposedly obsolete scam known as ""the wire"", using a large number of con artists to create a phony off-track betting parlor.
Aboard the opulent 20th Century Limited, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys his way into Lonnegan's private high-stakes poker game. Shaw makes Lonnegan furious with his behavior and then out-cheats him to win $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually fellow con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago Western Union office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by past-posting.
Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their scheme to arrest Gondorff using Hooker. Additionally, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with his men's inability to find and kill Hooker. Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, kill Hooker. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is soon seen following and observing Hooker.
Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the trifecta of another race. Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk. Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.
The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with Loretta, a waitress at a local restaurant. As Hooker leaves the building the next morning, he sees her walking toward him. The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ she was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and the man was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.
Armed with Harmon‚Äö√Ñ√¥s tip to ""place it on Lucky Dan"", Lonnegan makes a $500,000 bet at Shaw‚Äö√Ñ√¥s parlor on Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet, explaining that when he had said ""place it"" he had meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would ""place"" (i.e., finish second). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes the teller window and demands his money back. Just then, Agent Polk, Lt. Snyder, and half a dozen FBI officers storm the parlor. Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back; Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and provide a solid ""blow off"". As the other con men strip the room of its contents. Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying ""I'd only blow it"", and walks away with Gondorff.","poker,gimp,betrayal,great depression,mentor,witty,card playing,captivating,drunkenness,heist,gangster,roulette,counterfeit,revenge,chicago illinois,brothel,police,mob hit,con artist,pickpocket,casino,sting operation,organized crime,police corruption,police chase,humorous,drugstore,peoria illinois,poker player,new york city,fbi,gambling,mafia,cardsharp,ragtime,con,con man,feel good,clever,burlesque,police brutality,off track betting,atmospheric",2398.jpg,1973-12-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-sting/id282285129?uo=4,Y1jD_D1KPj8,,,"Classics,Comedy,Drama"
1144,The Sweet Hereafter,"A small community is torn apart by a tragic accident which kills most of the town's children. As a lawyer visits the victims' parents in hopes of launching a class action suit, the community is paralyzed by anger. All but one young girl, wheelchair-bound after the accident, who finds the courage to lead the way toward healing.","Life is difficult in a small town in British Columbia, Canada in the wake of a terrible school bus accident in which numerous local children are killed. Hardly able to cope with the loss, their grieving parents are approached by a lawyer, Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm), who wants them to sue for damages by claiming the bus was faulty. Stephens is aware that urging for a class action suit while the town is so aggrieved is ethically questionable, but persists anyway. He is meanwhile haunted by his dysfunctional relationship with his own adult daughter whom he may soon lose permanently to drug abuse. At first most of the parents are reluctant to sue, but eventually they are persuaded by Stephens that filing a class action lawsuit would ease their minds and also be the right thing to do.
As most of the children are dead, the case now depends on the few surviving witnesses to say the right things in court. In particular, it is 15-year-old Nicole Burnell (Sarah Polley), who was sitting at the front of the bus and is now paralyzed from the waist down, whose deposition is all-important. Before the accident, Nicole was a budding country music prodigy and she senses that her parents want justice and a large cash settlement to replace her lost music earnings‚Äö√Ñ√Æand not necessarily in that order. In the pretrial deposition, she unexpectedly accuses driver Dolores Driscoll (Gabrielle Rose) of speeding and thus causing the accident. When she does so, all hopes of holding the bus company liable vanish along with the possibility of a big settlement. It is implied that Nicole's motivation was partly to thwart and punish her parents, especially her sexually abusive father. Those involved know that Nicole is lying but can do nothing. The trial never occurs, leaving the townspeople, and Stephens, to cope in other ways with the uncertain future.",,1144.jpg,1997-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-sweet-hereafter/id517173588?uo=4,F7w-dPZI_LY,,,Drama
312,The Taking of Pelham One Two Three,"Walter Matthau stars as a New York transit cop who must keep four ruthless terrorists who've hijacked a Bronx subway car from killing hostages (a pimp, a pregnant Puerto Rican woman, a hippie, a prostitute, a WASP, a wino, and a gay man) one by one if their $1,000,000 ransom demand is not met within an hour.","In New York City, four heavily armed men with code names (Mr. Blue, Mr. Green, Mr. Grey, and Mr. Brown), wearing similar trenchcoat and mustache disguises, board at different station stops (Green at 59th Street, Grey at 51st Street, Brown at Grand Central, and finally Blue at 28th Street) on the Pelham 123 subway train run of the 6 Lexington Avenue Local service. The men take the train, securing a group of seventeen passengers whom they hold hostage, isolating them in one of the train's cars and then separating the car from the rest of the train.
Meanwhile, Lieutenant Zachary Garber (Walter Matthau), a cynical and curmudgeonly yet light-hearted New York City Transit Authority police lieutenant, begins his day by leading four visiting Tokyo Metro directors on a tour of New York's subway command-center. This is interrupted by Blue's radio announcement to the command center that ""your train has been taken."" Blue (Robert Shaw), the English-accented leader of the hijackers, tells Garber they are demanding a ransom of one million dollars, to be delivered to them within one hour; otherwise they will kill one passenger per minute, starting when the hour has passed.
Garber, the sarcastic Lieutenant Rico Patrone (Jerry Stiller), and other transit workers cooperate while trying to guess how the criminals intend to escape the subway tunnel and get away. Various clues soon surface for Garber to figure out, first with his hearing of Blue's very distinctive English accent over the radio. It later turns out that Blue was a ruthless British mercenary, and Green (Martin Balsam) is a former transit worker who from time to time sneezes over the radio and is heard by Garber, who responds by saying ""Gesundheit."" Garber also learns that one of the hostages is an undercover police officer.
The mayor finally agrees to pay the ransom at the urging of his deputy mayor and his wife (""But just think what you'll get in return... Eighteen sure votes."") The police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money. When the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the hijackers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it. A reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.
A police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers. With the money finally in hand, the hijackers demand that electric power be restored to the subway line, and that all signals in the path of the train be turned green from 28th Street to South Ferry, both of these being necessary for the car to move. Having overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, which would otherwise ensure its stopping unless someone remained at the throttle, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion. As the train starts to move, the undercover officer also jumps off the train and hides between the rails. The car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.
Outside the tunnel, Garber and Inspector Daniels are convinced that the runaway train is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left the train.
The hijackers divide the ransom money, discard their disguises, and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed and is shot dead by Blue. The undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot. Green escapes onto the street, while Blue shoots at the undercover officer until he wounds him.
Garber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to shoot the undercover officer dead. Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore. Told that it is not, Blue responds, ""Pity"", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.
Entering the South Ferry Loop, the runaway car finally encounters a red signal. The car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.
With three of the hijackers dead, information is brought up on their identities. None of the three are found to have any experience piloting trains. Green, the only hijacker to escape, has left as a clue only Garber's surmise that one of the hijackers must be an ex-motorman of the New York Transit Authority (owing to the hijackers' knowledge of the car's operation). With the dead three all identified, Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee. Garber and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen ""discharged for cause"" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman. Longman‚Äö√Ñ√Æknown to the audience as Mr. Green‚Äö√Ñ√Æis shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door. He hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning. The officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says ""Gesundheit."" Garber then re-opens the door, the expression on his face indicating that he knows he has just found the final hijacker.","rogue cop,public transport,mobster,suspense,tollbooth,shootout,mayor,suicide,mercenary,hijacker,control center,police officer,passenger,runaway train,gangster,detective,tunnel,train hijack,black comedy,numbers,undercover cop,demands,escape,police,disguise,panic,murder,negotiation,gracie mansion,train,visceral,extortion,suspect,hostage,loot,ransom,new york city,arrest,counting,tube,undercover,electrocution,hijacking,mayor's office,caper,subway,tension",312.jpg,1974-10-02, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/taking-pelham-one-two-three/id279300076?uo=4,,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

2414,The Thing,"Horror-meister John Carpenter (Halloween, Escape from New York) teams Kurt Russell's outstanding performance with incredible visuals to build this chilling version of the classic The Thing. In the winter of 1982, a twelve-man research team at a remote Antarctic research station discovers an alien buried in the snow for over 100,000 years. Once unfrozen, the form-changing alien wreaks havoc, creates terror and becomes one of them.","A Norwegian helicopter hunting an Alaskan Malamute lands at an American Antarctic research station. As the Americans run out, a thermite charge destroys the helicopter and kills the pilot. The rifleman keeps firing at the dog until he is killed by Lt. Garry, the station commander. Helicopter pilot R.J. MacReady and Dr. Copper fly to the Norwegian camp for answers, but find only a burned ruin, with the body of a man who committed suicide and a large block of ice with a hollowed cavity. Outside they discover the burned remains of a humanoid corpse with two faces. Back at the station, the biologist Blair performs an autopsy on the creature, but finds only a normal set of internal organs.
Clark, the station's dog handler, kennels the Malamute with the station's sled dogs, where it later metamorphoses and attacks them. MacReady pulls the fire alarm after hearing the dogs crying for help, comes with a flash light and Ithaca 37 shotgun and starts shooting at the creature after it starts absorbing another dog. Another station worker, Childs, arrives with a flamethrower and incinerates the creature. When an autopsy of the creature reveals that it is capable of perfectly imitating other lifeforms, Blair suspects that anyone could be replaced, and begins withdrawing from the others. The Norwegians' records lead the team to a crater containing a flying saucer and a hole left by the block of ice from which they suspect the creature came. Blair's assistant Fuchs tells MacReady that the creature's ""dead"" remains are still active on a cellular level, according to Blair's journal. Blair calculates that if the alien escapes to a civilized area, all life on Earth will be assimilated in three years.
Station meteorologist Bennings is attacked by the creature's remains, but as he metamorphoses he is caught outside by the team and MacReady burns him before he can escape. MacReady notices Blair was absent, then sees Blair run inside and discovers he has wrecked the helicopter and the other transports and killed the sled dogs, and is destroying the radio. The team corners him and locks him in the tool shed. Determined to learn who is infected, they discover the blood stores have been sabotaged before they can perform the blood-serum test Copper recommends, and the men begin to turn on each other. MacReady takes charge and orders Fuchs to continue Blair's work, but Fuchs disappears when the power goes out. As a storm closes in, MacReady, along with radio operator Windows and Nauls the cook, find Fuchs' burned body outside; MacReady theorizes that Fuchs burned himself before he could be assimilated. On the way back, Nauls cuts MacReady loose from the tow line, assuming he has been assimilated when he finds a torn shirt with MacReady's name on it. As the team debates MacReady's fate, he breaks in and threatens to dynamite the station if they attack him, and Norris suffers a heart attack.
When Copper attempts to revive Norris by defibrillation, his chest gapes open and closes like a giant mouth, biting off Copper's arms, who quickly dies from the injuries. MacReady incinerates the creature and orders Windows to tie up everyone for a new test, killing Clark when he tries to resist. MacReady explains his theory that every piece of the alien is an individual organism with its own survival instinct, that will react defensively when threatened, which involved Norris' head sprouting spider legs. One by one he tests everyone's blood with a heated piece of copper wire. They are all still human except Palmer, who begins to metamorphose and attacks Windows, forcing MacReady to burn them both.
Leaving Childs on guard, the others head out to test Blair, only to find that he has tunneled under the tool shed. They realize that Blair is an alien who has scavenged the equipment he appeared to destroy in order to build a small escape craft. MacReady speculates that the alien intends to freeze itself until a rescue team arrives in the spring. They decide to dynamite the complex hoping to destroy the alien but Garry and Nauls are killed by Blair before they finish setting the explosives underground. Blair transforms into a larger monster and attacks, but MacReady dynamites the monster and the base explodes as he escapes. Stumbling through the burning ruins with a bottle of scotch, MacReady finds Childs, who claims he got lost in the storm while pursuing Blair. Exhausted, they acknowledge the futility of their distrust and share the bottle as they watch the camp burn.","scary,suspenseful,tense",2414.jpg,1982-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-thing/id282249286?uo=4,p35JDJLa9ec,,,"Horror,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

2154,The Tillman Story,"Pat Tillman never thought of himself as a hero. His choice to leave a multimillion-dollar football contract and join the military wasn't done for any reason other than he felt it was the right thing to do. The fact that the military manipulated his tragic death in the line of duty into a propaganda tool is unfathomable and thoroughly explored in Amir Bar-Lev's riveting and enraging documentary.

","Pat Tillman gave up his professional football career to join the Army Rangers in 2002 -- and became an instant symbol of patriotic fervor and unflinching duty. But the truth about Pat Tillman is far more complex, and ultimately far more heroic, than the caricature created by the media. And, when the government tried to turn his death into propaganda, they took on the wrong family. From her home in Santa Cruz mountains, Pat's mother, Dannie Tillman, led the family's crusade to reveal the truth beneath the mythology of their son's life and death. ""The Tillman Story"" not only shines a light on the shady aftermath of Pat's death and calls to task the entire chain of command but also examines themes as timeless as the notion of heroism itself.",,2154.jpg,2010-08-20, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-tillman-story/id415604920?uo=4,jaMAVAqef7I,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"
2112,The Time Traveler's Wife,"""The Time Traveler's Wife"" is based on the best-selling book about a love that transcends time. Clare (Rachel McAdams) has been in love with Henry (Eric Bana) her entire life. She believes they are destined to be together, even though she never knows when they will be separated: Henry is a time traveler--cursed with a rare genetic anomaly that causes him to live his life on a shifting timeline, skipping back and forth through the years with no control. Despite the fact that Henry's travels force them apart with no warning, and never knowing when they will be reunited, Clare desperately tries to build a life with her one true love.","Using alternating first-person perspectives, the novel tells the stories of Henry DeTamble (born 1963), a librarian at the Newberry Library in Chicago, and his wife, Clare Anne Abshire (born 1971), an artist who makes paper sculptures. Henry has a rare genetic disorder, which comes to be known as Chrono-Displacement, that causes him to involuntarily travel through time. When 20-year-old Clare meets 28-year-old Henry at the Newberry Library in 1991 at the opening of the novel, he has never seen her before, although she has known him most of her life.
Henry begins time traveling at the age of six, jumping forward and backward relative to his own timeline. When he leaves, where he goes, or how long his trips will last are all beyond his control. His destinations are tied to his subconscious‚Äö√Ñ√Æhe most often travels to places and times related to his own history. Certain stimuli such as stress can trigger Henry's time traveling; he often goes jogging to keep calm and remain in the present. He also searches out pharmaceuticals in the future that may be able to help control his time traveling. He also seeks the advice of a geneticist, Dr. Kendrick. Henry cannot take anything with him into the future or the past; he always arrives naked and then struggles to find clothing, shelter, and food. He amasses a number of survival skills including lock-picking, self-defense, and pickpocketing. Much of this he learns from older versions of himself.
""It's hard being left behind. I wait for Henry, not knowing where he is, wondering if he's okay. It's hard to be the one who stays.""
‚Äö√Ñ√ÆClare[1]
Once their timelines converge ""naturally"" at the library‚Äö√Ñ√Ætheir first meeting in his chronology‚Äö√Ñ√ÆHenry starts to travel to Clare's childhood and adolescence in South Haven, Michigan, beginning in 1977 when she is six years old. On one of his early visits (from her perspective), Henry gives her a list of the dates he will appear and she writes them in a diary so she will remember to provide him with clothes and food when he arrives. During another visit, he inadvertently reveals that they will be married in the future. Over time they develop a close relationship. At one point, Henry helps Clare frighten and humiliate a boy who abused her. Clare is last visited in her youth by Henry in 1989, on her eighteenth birthday, during which they make love for the first time. They are then separated for two years until their meeting at the library.
Clare and Henry marry, but Clare has trouble bringing a pregnancy to term because of the genetic anomaly Henry may presumably be passing on to the fetus. After six miscarriages, Henry wishes to save Clare further pain and has a vasectomy. However a version of Henry from the past visits Clare one night and they make love; she subsequently gives birth to a daughter, Alba. Alba is diagnosed with Chrono-Displacement as well but, unlike Henry, she has some control over her destinations when she time travels. Before she is born, Henry travels to the future and meets his ten-year-old daughter on a school field trip and learns that he died when she is five years old.
When he is 43, during what is to be his last year of life, Henry time travels to a Chicago parking garage on a frigid winter night where he is unable to find shelter. As a result of the hypothermia and frostbite he suffers, his feet are amputated when he returns to the present. Henry and Clare both know that without the ability to escape when he time travels, Henry will certainly die within his next few jumps. On New Year's Eve 2006 Henry time travels into the middle of the Michigan woods in 1984 and is accidentally shot by Clare's brother, a scene foreshadowed earlier in the novel. Henry returns to the present and dies in Clare's arms.
Clare is devastated by Henry's death. She later finds a letter from Henry asking her to ""stop waiting"" for him, but which describes a moment in her future when she will see him again. The last scene in the book takes place when Clare is 82 years old and Henry is 43. She is waiting for Henry, as she has done most of her life. A subtle detail is that the previous scene, when Henry sees Clare, takes place after the final scene, in which Clare is waiting for Henry, not knowing when he will come.","spontaneous,appear,change,now you don’t,vanish,old age,time,future,face to face,ticking,year,childhood,continuum,tock,diary,watch,hours,husband wife relationship,nonlinear timeline,gone,librarian,jump,thin air,accidental shooting,month,fast forward,day,tick tock,miscarriage,foresight,reminder,sadness,choice,joy,timeline,space time,space,back to the future,time travel,hindsight,unpredictable,father son relationship,time passes,calendar,minutes,clock,trust,century,prediction,father daughter relationship,past,i cant stay,wind back,tick,now you see it,days,seconds,turn back,hindsite,disappear,week",2112.jpg,2009-08-14, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-time-travelers-wife/id328962477?uo=4,USUDlMBR-dQ,,,"Drama,Romance,Science Fiction & Fantasy"
1008,The Tourist,"Johnny Depp stars as an American tourist whose playful dalliance with a stranger leads to a web of intrigue, romance and danger in The Tourist.  During an impromptu trip to Europe to mend a broken heart, Frank (Depp) unexpectedly finds himself in a flirtatious encounter with Elise (Angelina Jolie), an extraordinary woman who deliberately crosses his path.  Against the breathtaking backdrop of Paris and Venice, their whirlwind romance quickly evolves as they find themselves unwittingly thrust into a deadly game of cat and mouse.","The film opens with Elise Clifton-Ward being followed by French Police, working with the London Metropolitan Police (Scotland Yard) under the direction of Inspector John Acheson (Paul Bettany). Acheson has spent years hunting Elise's old lover, Alexander Pearce, who owes ¬¨¬£744 million in back taxes and is believed to have received 20 million dollars worth of plastic surgery to alter his appearance completely. At a cafe, Elise receives written instructions from Pearce: board a train to Venice, pick out a man who resembles Pearce, and make the police believe that this decoy is Pearce himself. Elise burns the note, then manages to evade the police and board the train.
On the train, Elise picks Frank Tupelo, a U.S. community college teacher. She spends much time with him, seeming to start a romance. In the meanwhile, the police have managed to salvage the ashes of her burned note and assembled them to extract information regarding her rendezvous as well as her ruse. But an informer from the police station mistakenly communicates to Reginald Shaw, a gangster from whom Pearce as accountant stole $2.3 billion, that Pearce is travelling with Elise on the train to Venice. Shaw immediately proceeds to Venice.
Elise invites Frank to stay with her at the hotel room that has been arranged for her in Venice. Pearce leaves further instructions for Elise to attend a ball. Elise abandons Frank, who is then chased by Shaw's men. While trying to escape from them, Frank is detained by the Italian police ostensibly for his own safety, only to have a corrupt inspector turn him over to Shaw's men in exchange for the bounty that has been placed on Pearce's head. Elise rescues Frank just before he is handed over, leading Shaw's men on an extended boat chase and escaping. She leaves Frank at the airport with his passport and money, urging him to go home for his own safety.
Elise is revealed to be one of Scotland Yard's agents who may have become Pearce's ally. Because of her fears for Frank, she agrees to participate in a sting operation. At the ball, as Elise wanders around trying to spot Pearce in the crowd, an envelope is placed on the table in front of her by a man who then quickly disappears into the crowd. Elise sees that the envelope is for her, and believes that the man must be Pearce himself. She tries to follow him through the crowd, calling out his name, but is stopped by Frank who has managed to enter inside under a pretext.
Frank claims to be in love with her, and invites her to dance with him. But he is hauled away by the police, while Elise opens the envelope and finds a note mentioning a rendezvous point. She then heads off in her boat to this new rendezvous point. Shaw and his men tail her in their boat; both parties are followed discreetly by the police boat in which Frank is held handcuffed to stop him from obstructing the investigation.
When Elise arrives at the destination, Shaw takes her prisoner, threatening to harm her unless she reveals the location of the stolen money. The police monitor the situation inside the rendezvous room through audio and video links. Despite Elise's peril, Acheson repeatedly turns down police requests to intervene with their snipers. While the police are occupied in monitoring the situation, Frank escapes from the police boat and confronts Shaw, claiming to be Pearce who has undergone plastic surgery and offering to open the safe if Elise is allowed to leave safely. Shaw is skeptical and makes a counter offer that Frank should open the safe if he does not want to see Elise being cut up. Chief Inspector Jones (Timothy Dalton) arrives at the police stake-out, overrides Acheson, and orders the police snipers to fire into the room, killing Shaw and his men. Jones lifts Elise's suspension and also terminates her employment.
Acheson receives a radio message that Pearce has been found not far from the rendezvous point, and rushes to the location where police have detained the suspect. But the man claims to be just a tourist who has merely been following instructions texted to his mobile phone, to be present at certain locations, for which he has been receiving payments. Meanwhile, Elise tells Frank that she loves him, but she also loves Pearce. Frank then suggests a ""solution"" to this dilemma; to Elise's surprise, he opens the safe by entering the correct code, thus revealing that he is really Alexander Pearce. He and Elise then take the money and depart, leaving a cheque in the safe for the full amount of the taxes he owes. The police find the cheque when they return and blow the safe open. Acheson now realizes that Frank has indeed been Pearce all along, and wants to pursue him; but Jones determines that, with the taxes now paid fully, Pearce's only crime is that he stole money from a now-dead gangster. Jones orders the case to be closed. Frank and Elise sail away to a new life together, with Elise taking in and getting used to the new and completely altered face of her old lover.","mobster,mistaken identity,scotland yard,stylized,fake accent,incognito,undercover agent,surveillance,russian,tourist,fake identity,venice italy,plastic surgery,investigation,train,femme fatale,money,tense,american tourist,botox,thug,russian mafia,suspenseful,undercover,letter",1008.jpg,2010-12-08, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-tourist/id416703161?uo=4,GrqpKEOF8uw,,,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

But his last shipment, a beautiful young woman kidnapped by international slave traders, brings deadly complications to his delivery plans. Now Frank must kick into overdrive in a nonstop action-packed fight to save his precious cargo - and his life.","This film is about a man whose job is to deliver packages without asking any questions. Complications arise when he breaks those rules.
Ex-Special Forces operator Frank Martin lives what seems to be a quiet life along the French Mediterranean, hiring himself out as a mercenary ""transporter"" who moves goods--human or otherwise--from one place to another. No questions asked. Carrying out mysterious and sometimes dangerous tasks in his tricked-out BMW, Frank adheres to a strict set of rules, which he never breaks. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. Frank's newest transport seems no different from the countless ones he's done in the past. He's been hired by an American known only as ""Wall Street"" to make a delivery; but when Frank stops along the route, he notices his package is moving. Violating Rule Three, Frank looks inside the bag, finding its contents to be a beautiful, gagged woman. Frank's steadfast adherence to his other two rules--which make up his basic code of survival--also quickly fails, hurtling him and his new companion on a road leading to shocking secrets, deadly complications, and the last thing that Frank ever expected to come to believe: that rules are made to be broken.

The impressionistic story of a Texas family in the 1950s. The film follows the life journey of the eldest son, Jack, through the innocence of childhood to his disillusioned adult years as he tries to reconcile a complicated relationship with his father (Brad Pitt).

","A mysterious, wavering light, resembling a flame, flickers in the darkness. Mrs. O'Brien (Jessica Chastain) recalls a lesson taught to her that people must choose to follow either the path of grace or the path of nature. In the 1960s, she receives a telegram informing her of the death of her son, R.L., aged nineteen, in military service. Mr. O'Brien (Brad Pitt) is notified by telephone while at an airport. The family is thrown into turmoil.
In the present day, the O'Briens' eldest son, Jack O'Brien (Sean Penn), is adrift in his modern life as an architect. One day he apologizes to his father on the phone for an argument about R.L.'s death. In his office, Jack begins reflecting and we see shots of tall buildings under the sky, Jack wandering in the desert, trees that stretch from the ground up to the sun high in their leaves and scenes from his childhood in the 1950s that all link together and lead back to the flame.
From the darkness the universe is born, the Milky Way and then the solar system form while voice-overs ask existential questions. On the newly formed Earth, volcanoes erupt and microbes begin to form and replicate. Sea life is born, then plants on land, then dinosaurs.[4] An asteroid tumbles through space and strikes the Earth.
In a sprawling neighborhood in Waco, Texas live the O'Briens. The young couple is enthralled by their new baby Jack and, later, his two brothers. When Jack (Hunter McCracken) reaches adolescence, he is faced with the conflict of accepting the way of grace or nature, as embodied by each of his parents. Mrs. O'Brien (grace) is gentle, nurturing, and authoritative, presenting the world to her children as a place of wonder. Mr. O'Brien (nature) is strict and authoritarian, and easily loses his temper as he struggles to reconcile his love for his sons with wanting to prepare them for a world he sees as corrupt and exploitative. He laments his decision to become an engineer rather than to pursue his passion of becoming a musician. He tries to get ahead by filing patents for various inventions.
Jack's perceptions of the world begin to change after one of his friends drowns at the pool and another of his friends is burned in a house fire. He becomes angry at his father for his bullying behavior and begins to keep a running tally of Mr. O'Brien's various hypocrisies and misdeeds while lashing out at his mother for allowing the behavior.
One summer, Mr. O'Brien takes a long business trip. While he is away, the boys enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns home from his unsuccessful business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating to work in a thankless position within the firm or being made redundant. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.
In the present, adult Jack leaves work. Riding the elevator down, he experiences a vision of following his young self across rocky terrain, in the far distant future in which the sun expands into a red giant engulfing the earth and then shrinks into a feeble white dwarf. Jack tentatively walks through a wooden door frame, erected on the rocks. On a sandbar, Jack sees images of death and the dead returning to life. He is reunited with his family and all the people who populate his memory. His father is happy to see him. He encounters his dead brother, whom he brings to his parents. Accompanied by a woman in white and her younger self, Mrs. O'Brien looks to the sky and whispers, ""I give him to you. I give you my son.""

She's in for a rude awakening when her bosses team her with Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), a hardcore TV personality who promises to spill the ugly truth on what makes men and women tick.","Abby Richter (Katherine Heigl) is a morning show TV producer in Sacramento, California. Abby firmly believes in true love and is a big supporter of complex self help books such as Chicken Soup for the Soul and Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus. Coming home from a disastrous date, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, The Ugly Truth, featuring Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler), whose cynicism about relationships prompts Abby to call in to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers the TV station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings. The station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show.
At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds her to be naive and a control freak. Nevertheless, when she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin (Eric Winter) living next to her, Mike convinces her that by following his advice she will improve her chances with Colin. Abby is skeptical, but they make a deal: If Mike's management of her courtship results in her landing Colin, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to leave her show.[2]
Mike succeeds in improving the ratings, brings married co-anchors Georgia and Larry closer and successfully instructs Abby to be exactly what Colin would want through a number of pointers including: always laugh at his jokes and say he is amazing in bed. Mike is invited to appear on The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson and is offered a job at another network. Abby is forced to cancel a romantic weekend away with Colin, during which they had planned to finally sleep together, and instead fly to Los Angeles to persuade Mike to stay with her show.
They drink and dance and Mike admits he does not want to move because he wants to stay in Sacramento near his sister and nephew. In the hotel elevator, they passionately kiss, but go to their separate rooms. Mike, dealing with the intensity of his feelings for Abby, calls on her room only to find Colin has shown up to surprise her. Mike leaves. Abby is upset and soon realizes Colin only likes the woman she has been pretending to be, not the real her. She breaks up with him.
Mike quits and takes a job with a rival TV station in Sacramento, and ends up doing a broadcast at the same hot-air balloon festival as Abby. He cannot resist intruding when she kicks the new ""Mike Chadway"" imitator off the air and goes into a tirade about what cowardly weaklings men are. The balloon takes off while they argue. Abby says she broke up with Colin, and Mike admits he loves her. Abby kisses him while they fly off, all of which is broadcast due to a camera mounted in the balloon. The film ends with Abby and Mike in bed. When Mike asks if he is really that good, Abby smirks and responds, ""You'll never know.""","witty,sexy,humorous,feel good",2074.jpg,2009-07-16, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-ugly-truth/id326037925?uo=4,DvsZtGxsvV0&hd=1,,,"Comedy,Romance"

","The film explores the illegal growth, sale and trafficking of marijuana. The film follows host Adam Scorgie as he examines the underground market, interviewing growers, police officers, criminologists, psychologists, economists, doctors, politicians and pop culture icons, revealing how the trade is booming despite being a criminal enterprise. The history of marijuana and the reasons for its present prohibition are discussed, often comparing it to the prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920s, suggesting that gang drug warfare and other negative aspects associated with marijuana are a result of prohibition, not the drug itself. The gangs that grow and traffic the drugs are likened to those that appeared in major U.S. cities during Prohibition, with the intention of profiting from the sale of illegal alcohol. The film answers many questions about marijuana, including the purported health effects of marijuana use, the Gateway drug theory, and what could happen if marijuana was legalized. The film also discusses the medicinal value of the marijuana plant and what the pharmaceutical industry stands to lose from marijuana legalization.","thought provoking,biting",957.jpg,2007-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/union-business-behind-getting/id445375750?uo=4,3HLzmH9VB6A,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"

This classic confrontation between good and evil and stars Kevin Costner as federal agent Eliot Ness, Robert De Niro as gangland kingpin Al Capone and Sean Connery as Malone, the cop who teaches Ness how to beat the mob: shoot fast and shoot first.","During Prohibition, Al Capone (De Niro) has nearly the whole city of Chicago under his control and supplies liquor at high prices. Bureau of Prohibition agent Eliot Ness (Costner), summoned to stop Capone, conducts raids using a large squad of officers. After his efforts fail due to corrupt policemen tipping off Capone, he meets incorruptible Irish American officer Jim Malone (Connery) and is told to enlist men from the police academy who have not yet come under Capone's influence. Italian American trainee George Stone (Garc‚àö‚â†a), is enlisted due to his superior marksmanship and intelligence. They are joined by accountant Oscar Wallace (Smith), assigned to Ness from Washington, D.C.
Wallace informs Ness that Capone has not filed an income tax return in four years; therefore, they can try Capone for tax evasion. Ness is visited by an alderman who tries to bribe him into dropping the investigation, but Ness throws him out. When Frank Nitti (Drago) threatens Ness's family, Ness has them moved to a safer place, then takes the team to the Canada ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ United States border for a raid on a liquor shipment. Ness chases one of the gangsters into an empty house and kills him in self-defense. Malone captures George (Sullivan), a Capone bookkeeper, and brings him back to the house for interrogation. George proves uncooperative, so Malone grabs the dead man and shoots him to coerce George into cooperating, much to the dismay of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who have assisted in the raid.
At the police station, Nitti kills Wallace and George and writes ""touchable"" on the wall in Wallace's blood. Ness angrily confronts Capone and his men, but Malone intervenes, as Capone mocks Ness over the death of his friend. Malone persuades Ness to stall the district attorney (James) from dropping the case, then corners policeman Mike Dorsett, who sold out Wallace and George to Capone. Malone learns about another Capone accountant, Walter Payne, and calls Ness with the news. A knife-wielding thug breaks into Malone‚Äö√Ñ√¥s home; Malone forces him out the front door with a shotgun, but steps into an ambush set up by Nitti who guns him down with a Tommy gun. He lives long enough for Ness and Stone to find him, and shows them which train Payne will take out of town before he dies.
Ness and Stone arrive at Union Station and find Payne guarded by several gangsters. After a fierce shootout, the two succeed in killing the gangsters and taking Payne alive. Payne testifies in court about the cash flows throughout the Capone organization, with the result of $1 million. Ness, however, notices that Capone seems unperturbed despite the probability of serving a long prison sentence, and also sees Nitti carrying a gun inside his jacket. He escorts Nitti out of the courtroom with the bailiff and discovers that Nitti has the mayor‚Äö√Ñ√¥s permission to carry the weapon. Ness identifies Nitti as Malone‚Äö√Ñ√¥s assassin after seeing Malone's address in Nitti's matchbook.
Nitti shoots the bailiff in a panic and flees to the roof of the building, but Ness corners him. Ness says Nitti will pay for killing Malone, but when Nitti says that he will never go to prison, Ness angrily pushes him off the roof. In the courtroom, Stone shows Ness a document from Nitti‚Äö√Ñ√¥s jacket that reveals that the jury was bribed, explaining Capone's relaxed mood. The judge has no intention of using it as evidence until Ness bluffs that the judge's name is in Payne‚Äö√Ñ√¥s ledger of payoffs. The judge decides to switch juries with a neighboring courtroom and restart the trial. However, Capone's lawyer suddenly withdraws their plea of ""not guilty"" and enters a plea of ""guilty"" without Capone's consent, and Capone is sentenced to eleven years in prison.
Packing up his Chicago office, Ness ponders the Saint Jude pendant that Malone had carried with him for many years, and which Malone had given to him before dying. He gives the pendant to Stone, reasoning that Malone would have wanted a cop to have it. A reporter mentions that Prohibition is due to be repealed and asks what Ness might do then, Ness responds, ""I think I‚Äö√Ñ√¥ll have a drink.""","mob,crime boss,mobster,u.s. canadian border,hitman,psychopath,stylized,tax evader,corruption,tough cop,lawlessness,captivating,brutality,gangster,intimidation,untouchable,revenge,chicago illinois,tax evasion,smuggling,interrogation,police,gun violence,money laundering,jury tampering,treasury agent,corrupt cop,tommy gun,raid,trust,organized crime,u.s. treasury agent,police corruption,illegal business,rough,violence,federal agent,trial,mafia,whiskey,suspenseful,deception,bribery,g man,criminal justice,prohibition,accountant,fear",224.jpg,1987-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-untouchables/id266641150?uo=4,i0KTI7_PCfI,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama"
205,The Usual Suspects,"A boat has been destroyed, criminals are dead, and the key to this mystery lies with the only survivor and his twisted, convoluted story beginning with five career crooks in a seemingly random police lineup.
Following a truck hijack in New York, five conmen are arrested and brought together for questioning. As none of them is guilty, they plan a revenge operation against the police. The operation goes well, but then the influence of a legendary mastermind criminal called Keyser is felt. It becomes clear that each one of them has wronged at some point and must pay back now. The payback job leaves 27 men dead in a boat explosion, but the real question arises now: Who actually is Keyser Soze?

","On a ship in San Pedro Bay, a faceless figure identified as ""Keyser"" speaks briefly with an injured man called Keaton (Byrne), then appears to shoot Keaton, before setting the ship ablaze. The next day, agents Jack Baer (Esposito) and Dave Kujan (Palminteri) of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Customs Service respectively, arrive in San Pedro separately to investigate what happened on the boat. There appear to be only two survivors: Roger ""Verbal"" Kint (Spacey), a con artist with cerebral palsy, and a hospitalized Hungarian criminal named Arkosh Kovash. Baer interrogates the severely burned Kovash in the hospital, who claims that Keyser Soze, a Turkish criminal mastermind with a near-mythical reputation, was in the harbor ""killing many men"". Kovash begins to describe Soze through an interpreter while a police sketch artist draws a rendering of Soze's face. Meanwhile, Verbal has testified at length about the incident in exchange for near-total immunity. While waiting to post bail on a minor weapons charge, Verbal is placed in the cluttered office of San Pedro Police Sergeant Jeffrey Rabin (Hedaya) where Kujan demands to hear his story from the beginning. Verbal's tale starts six weeks earlier in New York City:
Five criminals are brought together in a police lineup: Dean Keaton, a corrupt former police officer who has apparently given up his life of crime; Michael McManus (Baldwin), a short-tempered professional thief; Fred Fenster (del Toro), McManus' partner who speaks in mangled English; Todd Hockney (Pollak), a hijacker; and Verbal.
While in holding, McManus convinces the others to join forces to commit a robbery targeting New York's Finest Taxi Service, a group of corrupt New York City Police Department officers who escort smugglers to their destinations around the city. After the successful robbery, the quintet travel to Los Angeles to sell their loot to McManus' fence, ""Redfoot"" (Greene), who talks them into another job: robbing a purported jewel dealer. Instead of carrying jewels or money as they were told, however, the dealer had heroin. An angry confrontation between the thieves and Redfoot reveals that the job came from a lawyer named Kobayashi (Postlethwaite). The thieves later meet with Kobayashi, who claims to work for Keyser Soze and who blackmails them into attacking a ship at San Pedro harbor. Kobayashi describes the boat as smuggling $91 million worth of cocaine to be purchased by Soze's rivals. The thieves are to destroy the drugs and, if they choose to wait until the buyers arrive, split the cash.
In the present, Verbal tells Kujan the story of Keyser Soze. Years before, his Hungarian rivals invaded his home and demanded his territory, raping his wife and killing one of his children to show him their resolve. In response, Soze surprised them by killing his own wife and remaining children, then massacred the entire mob. He then went underground, never directly dealing with anyone in person, and became ""a spook story criminals tell their kids at night"". Baer tells Kujan that he has heard rumors for years about Soze's insulating himself behind layers of minions who do not know for whom they are working.
Verbal resumes his story. Fenster attempts to run away, only to be killed by Kobayashi. The four remaining thieves kidnap Kobayashi, intending to kill him if he does not leave them alone. Unbowed, Kobayashi reveals that Edie Finneran (Amis), Keaton's lawyer and girlfriend, is in his office (believing she was hired for legal services), and he threatens to kill her as well as the families of the four thieves, should they refuse the job.
On the night of the cocaine deal, the sellers (a group of Argentine mobsters) and the buyers (a group of Hungarian mobsters) are on the dock. Keaton tells Verbal to stay back, and to take the money to Edie if the plan goes awry so she can pursue Kobayashi ""her way"". Verbal reluctantly agrees, and watches the boat from a distance. Keaton, McManus, and Hockney attack the men at the pier, killing most of them. Keaton and McManus board the ship to find the drugs while Hockney goes after the van carrying the cash, though he is fatally shot by someone unseen when he finds it. Keaton and McManus discover there is no cocaine on the boat. Meanwhile, the unseen assailant shoots a closely guarded Argentine passenger; this same figure kills McManus and wounds Keaton. The mysterious figure appears to speak briefly with Keaton before shooting him again.
With Verbal's story finished, Kujan reveals what he knows: the Argentinian man murdered on the boat was Arturo Marquez, a drug dealer who, in order to escape jail time, had revealed to authorities that he could identify Keyser Soze. A group of Hungarians Kujan assumes to be the same group that Soze nearly annihilated in Turkey were offering to buy Marquez from the Argentinian group for $91 million. Using the fabrication of a drug deal, Kujan speculates, Soze had Verbal and his crew sent to the docks as a cover for Soze to personally enter the boat and kill Marquez undetected. Kujan concludes that Keaton actually was Keyser Soze; he is convinced that Keaton has faked his death (as he had done some years earlier to escape another investigation) and deliberately left Verbal as a witness. Under Kujan's aggressive questioning, Verbal tearfully admits that the whole scheme was Keaton's idea from the beginning, but refuses to testify.
His bail having been posted, Verbal retrieves his personal effects from the property officer. Moments later, Kujan, relaxing in Rabin's office, realizes that details and names from Verbal's story are culled from various objects around the room - including Rabin's crowded bulletin board and the ""Kobayashi Porcelain Company"" logo on the bottom of his coffee cup. Kujan realizes that most of Verbal's story was improvised for his benefit and chases after him, running past a fax machine as it receives the police artist's impression of Keyser Soze's face, which resembles none other than Verbal Kint.
Meanwhile, Verbal walks away from the police station, dropping his feigned limp. He gets into a waiting car driven by ""Kobayashi"", pulling away just as Kujan comes outside, searching in vain. Verbal's quote from Charles Baudelaire is repeated: ""The greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist."" This is followed by his earlier description of Keyser Soze: ""And like that, he's gone.""

","Walter Vale (Richard Jenkins) is a widowed Connecticut College economics professor who lives a fairly solitary existence. He fills his days by sometimes taking piano lessons in an effort to emulate his late wife, a classical concert pianist, and infrequently works on a new book. When he is asked to present a paper at an academic conference at New York University, he is not enthusiastic to make the trip, given he is only the nominal co-author and has never even read the complete work. Charles (Michael Cumpsty), his department head, insists and Walter is forced to attend.
When he arrives in his old apartment in Manhattan, Walter is startled to find a young unmarried couple living there, having rented it from a swindler who claimed it was his. Tarek is an immigrant form Syria (Haaz Sleiman), a Palestinian-Syrian[5] djembe player, and Zainab (Danai Gurira), a Senegalese designer of ethnic jewelry. He later discovers both are illegal immigrants. Although they have no place to go, they hastily pack and leave, but Walter decides to let them stay. Over the next few days, a friendship slowly develops. Tarek teaches Walter to play the drum, and the two men join a group of others at a regular drum circle in Central Park.
On the way home, Tarek is mistakenly charged with subway turnstile jumping, arrested for ""failing"" to pay his fare (although he actually had), and taken to a detention center for illegal immigrants in Queens. In order to prevent Tarek's deportation from the United States, Walter hires an immigration lawyer. Feeling uncomfortable about remaining in the apartment with Walter, Zainab moves out to live with relatives in Bronx.
Tarek's mother, Mouna (Hiam Abbass), unexpectedly arrives from her home in Michigan when she is unable to contact her son. Because she is also illegally in the States, she is unable to visit her son. Hesitating, she accepts Walter's offer to stay in the apartment, and the two develop a friendship. Walter confesses his life is unfullfilling; he dislikes the single course he has taught for twenty years, and the book he allegedly is writing is nowhere near completion. It is revealed that Mouna's journalist husband died following a lengthy politically motivated imprisonment in Syria, and she is concerned about her son's future prospects if he is deported. The two begin to share a simple domestic existence, with Mouna preparing meals and Walter treating her to The Phantom of the Opera when she mentions her love for the original cast recording Tarek sent her as a gift.
Without warning, Tarek is summarily deported back to Syria. Mouna, left with no one in the States, decides to follow him and to return back to live there. On their final night, Mouna joins Walter for a comforting embrace in bed, blaming herself for all that has gone wrong. Walter sees her off at the airport the next day. Alone once again, Walter plays his drum on a subway platform, as Tarek once told him he himself would like to do some time.","emotional,bittersweet,touching,gloomy",1191.jpg,2008-04-18,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-visitor/id413863910?uo=4 ,KY0FEt3mBog,,,Drama

","In 1985, Robbie Hart (Sandler) is a wedding singer from Ridgefield, New Jersey. He is engaged to his long-time girlfriend, Linda (Angela Featherstone), who was attracted to him at a time when he dreamed of becoming a rock star. He meets and befriends a waitress, Julia Sullivan (Barrymore), at the reception hall where he regularly performs. Julia is also engaged, to businessman Glenn Gulia (Matthew Glave).
Disappointed over Robbie's loss of ambition, Linda changes her mind on their wedding day and leaves Robbie standing at the altar, emotionally devastated. Robbie tries to move forward with his life, but despair hinders his performances. Julia tries to cheer him up, and later asks him to help her plan her own wedding. Robbie eventually agrees, and their friendship blossoms. During a double date between Julia and Glenn, and Robbie and Julia's cousin, Holly (Christine Taylor), Robbie learns that Glenn is frequently cheating on Julia and doesn't plan to stop after being married.
Julia and Robbie are increasingly confused by their deepening feelings for each other, and Robbie mistakenly believes that he can impress Julia by getting a more conventional job. She becomes angry with him for assuming that she is marrying Glenn for his money. After confiding in his best friend, Sammy (Allen Covert), Robbie finally decides to confess his true feelings and goes to Julia's house. When he arrives, he sees her through her bedroom window. She is wearing her wedding dress and happily imagining herself as Robbie's wife, but Robbie mistakenly concludes that she is looking forward to marrying Glenn.
Heartbroken, Robbie leaves to get drunk and finds Glenn in the midst of his ""pre-bachelor party party"". After a heated exchange, Glenn punches Robbie. An intoxicated Robbie goes home and finds Linda waiting for him, and wanting to reconcile. Robbie passes out, but the following morning, Linda answers the door and introduces herself as Robbie's fianc‚àö¬©e to a crestfallen Julia. Julia runs to Glenn, wanting to be married immediately, and Glenn happily offers to take her to Las Vegas.
Robbie awakens and promptly breaks it off with Linda for good. Inspired by the 50th wedding anniversary of his friend Rosie, to whom he has been giving singing lessons, Robbie decides to pursue Julia. Just then, Holly arrives, telling him of Julia's plans. Robbie, Sammy, and Holly rush to the airport, where Robbie books a flight to Las Vegas. He gets a first class ticket because all coach seats are sold out. After telling his story to a sympathetic audience in first class which includes Billy Idol (playing himself, sporting his '80s trademark spiked hairdo and biker attire), Robbie learns that Glenn and Julia are on the same flight as he peeps through the curtain separating first class and coach. Over the loudspeaker, and with the help of Idol and the flight crew, Robbie sings a song he has written called ""Grow Old With You,"" which he has dedicated to Julia. When he enters the coach area, Glenn tries to attack him, only for his path to be blocked by a male flight attendant and Idol both pushing refreshment carts. When Glenn threatens Idol, a burly Idol fan also wearing biker attire forces Glenn down the aisle, and a female flight attendant he tried seducing earlier pushes him into the cabin toilet. Robbie and Julia admit their love for each other, and, after Idol briefly interrupts them to offer Robbie support in fulfilling his dream of being a songwriter, they share a kiss. The film ends as the scene fades to a similar kiss, this time at their wedding and Dave Veltri becomes the new Wedding Singer.","every little thing she does is magic,pop culture,somebody kill me,wedding,michael jackson,musical youth,new order,out of your ass,humiliation,white glove,hold me now,wedding reception,waitress,love my way,video killed the radio star,delorean,kiss,culture club – do you really want to hurt me,broken heart,cousin cousin relationship,sugarhill gang with ellen dow,rappers delight,aisle seat,elvis costello,don johnson,van halen,anticipation,boy george,microphone,bar mitzvah,double date,sure thing,1980s,mile high club,get laid,engagement,china girl,miami vice,blake carrington,rapping,listen to every damn word,singer,michael jackson,miami vice,adam sandler,billy idol,compact disc,everyday i write the book,singing,joy,prime rib,pass the dutchie,groom,stage,blue monday,infidelity,vinnie barbarino,meat,rubik's cube,wedding singer,paying you to sing,nostalgia,hurt me,sentimental,the smiths,julia guglia,cross dressing,fiance,the police,delorean dmc 12,humorous,material girl,white wedding,anger,material world,jilted at the altar,thompson twins,whoopee-dee-doo,how soon is now,billy idol gets it,limousine,jilted groom,the presidents of the united states of america,david bowie,fonzie,limousine driver,the psychedelic furs",303.jpg,1998-02-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-wedding-singer/id294154524?uo=4,_bhU3NsCIDs,,,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"

","Dorothy Gale (Judy Garland) is a 12 year old farm girl living in Kansas with her Aunt Em (Clara Blandick) and Uncle Henry (Charles Grapewin). Her guardians and the farmhands Hunk (Ray Bolger), Zeke (Bert Lahr) and Hickory (Jack Haley) are too busy pay attention to her. Em then tells her niece to find a ""place where she won't get into any trouble"" causing her to sing ""Over the Rainbow"". Miss Gulch (Margaret Hamilton) shows up to have Dorothy's pet dog Toto destroyed after he bit her earlier on. Toto escapes though and Dorothy, knowing she'll be back, decides to run away. They meet Professor Marvel (Frank Morgan), who claims via his crystal ball that Em is ""sick"". Believing him, Dorothy heads back to the farm but her family and the hands are in the storm cellar and Dorothy has her head hit by a window frame. Dorothy awakens and discovers they are in the core of a tornado and the house lands with a bump.
Dorothy and Toto enter a technicolor world named Oz and meet Glinda the Witch of the North (Billie Burke) who states that they are now in Munchkinland, and that Dorothy's house has killed the Wicked Witch of the East. The Munchkins rejoice that the Witch is dead but her evil sister, the Witch of the West (Margaret Hamilton) arrives and is furious both that her sister is dead and her dead sister's magical ruby slippers are now worn by Dorothy, thanks to Glinda. She promises vengeance on Dorothy and Toto before leaving. Glinda tells Dorothy she can get back to Kansas by going following the yellow brick road to see the Wizard of Oz, who lives in the Emerald City.
Dorothy and Toto en route to the city encounter the Scarecrow (Ray Bolger), Tin Man (Jack Haley) and the bipedal Cowardly Lion (Bert Lahr) who each wish for a brain, heart and courage respectively. As they approach the city, the Witch tries to kill Dorothy by spiking the poppy field with poison, but Glinda intervenes, much to the fury of the Witch. The friends eventually arrive at the city and are greeted by both the door keeper and coachman (both Frank Morgan). Dorothy and the Lion get makeovers, while Scarecrow gets fresh straw and the Tin Man is polished. After the Witch sends a threatening message, they meet the Wizard's guard (Frank Morgan), who eventually gets them in to see the Wizard (Frank Morgan), who says he will grant their wishes for a service: by bringing him the Witch of the West's broom.
On their way to the Witch's castle, the flying monkeys ambush them and kidnap Dorothy and Toto. In the castle, the Witch blackmails Dorothy, threatening to drown Toto if she does not give her the slippers. After Dorothy agrees, the Witch is still unable to get them due to a shower of sparks. The Witch then remembers the slippers will remain on Dorothy's feet until she dies. Toto escapes and the Witch locks Dorothy in the tower, planning to execute her once the top bulb of her hourglass is empty. Toto finds the trio and they overpower three Winkie guards before saving Dorothy, but are chased by the Witch and her other guards. They soon trap the foursome and the Witch sets Scarecrow afire. Dorothy, in putting out the flames with a bucket of water, accidentally splashes water over the Witch, causing her to melt. The Winkies are now free and reward Dorothy by giving her the broomstick.
Back in Emerald City, the Wizard still refuses to grant their wishes, but after Toto exposes him as a normal middle-aged man, he says he will do so. He gives the Scarecrow a diploma, Lion a medal and Tin Man a heart-shaped clock. He decides to fly Dorothy home in his hot air balloon, but it takes off without her. Glinda arrives and tells her the ruby slippers will get her home. After saying her goodbyes, Dorothy clicks her heels three times and awakens back home surrounded by her family, the three farmhands and Marvel. She claims the hands and Marvel were in Oz and says ""There's no place like home"", though it is implied Dorothy's visit to Oz was simply a dream.","exciting,sentimental,sincere,touching,joy,feel good,stylized,atmospheric,anticipation,captivating,fear",29.jpg,1939-08-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-wizard-of-oz/id320384447?uo=4,aVG8F9D7suw,,,"Animation,Classics,Kids & Family,Musical & Performing Arts,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

305,The Young Victoria,"A dramatization of the turbulent first years of Queen Victoria's rule, and her enduring romance with Prince Albert.
Dominated by her possessive mother and her bullying consort, Conroy, since childhood, teen-aged Victoria refuses to allow them the power of acting as her regent in the last days of her uncle, William IV's rule. Her German cousin Albert is encouraged to court her for solely political motives but, following her accession at age eighteen, finds he is falling for her and is dismayed at her reliance on trusty premier Melbourne. Victoria is impressed by Albert's philanthropy which is akin to her own desire to help her subjects. However her loyalty to Melbourne, perceived as a self-seeker, almost causes a constitutional crisis and it is Albert who helps restore her self-confidence. She proposes and they marry, Albert proving himself not only a devoted spouse, prepared to take an assassin's bullet for her, but an agent of much-needed reform, finally endorsed by an admiring Melbourne.

","Princess Victoria of Kent is the heiress presumptive to the throne during the last years of the reign of her uncle King William IV. She is brought up under a strict set of rules devised by her mother (her father having died when Victoria was a baby), the Duchess of Kent and comptroller of the Duchess's household, Sir John Conroy, who calls it the ""Kensington System."" Conroy hopes that William IV will die while Victoria is still a minor, thus the Duchess would be appointed Regent, and he would be the power behind the throne through his considerable control of the Duchess. Victoria grows rebellious and resentful of her mother and Conroy's oppressive control of her every move. During an illness, her mother and Conroy attempt to force Victoria to sign papers that would make Conroy her personal secretary upon her majority. Although weak and ill, Victoria is strong enough to vehemently refuse this ploy, throwing the papers on the floor.
Her uncle King Leopold I of Belgium wishes to use his influence through family ties to secure an alliance between Britain and Belgium. He realizes his sister, the Duchess, exerts little influence over Victoria and decides to have his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld seduce Victoria. Albert is trained by Baron Stockmar to learn Victoria's interests, including her favorite novels, music and opera. The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers, Albert and Prince Ernest of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld to visit the household. Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other, despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by her uncle to win her favours. They begin writing to one another after Albert has returned home.
To maintain control over Victoria, Conroy and the Duchess keep her away from the King's court, and are unhappy when she insists on attending the King's birthday reception. At the reception in Windsor Castle, the King, stating his wish to be closer to Victoria, insults her mother in public twice. The King increases Victoria's income but this is rejected by Conroy, who physically subdues her in front of her mother, heightening the animosity between them. The King is outraged and sends the Whig Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her. Victoria agrees to appoint Lord Melbourne as her private secretary, and he appoints her ladies-in-waiting, including the Duchess of Sutherland.
King William dies after Victoria's 18th birthday, avoiding a regency. After accession, Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence, including moving into her own room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation. During her first meeting with the Privy Council, she announces, ""I am young, but I am willing to learn. And I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people. I look for your help in this."" Victoria moves into the recently completed Buckingham Palace. The Queen Dowager, Queen Adelaide advises Victoria against accepting all of Lord Melbourne's proposed ladies-in-waiting, but he persists. Lord Melbourne and Albert begin a battle for influence over Victoria. Albert goes to England to spend more time with Victoria. They bond further, dancing during her coronation and Albert hints at going further with their relationship but Victoria resists.
Lord Melbourne loses a vote in Parliament, leading Victoria to invite Sir Robert Peel of the Tories to form a new government. Victoria refuses to allow Peel to replace her ladies-in-waiting, who are allies of Lord Melbourne. Peel in turn refuses the queen's invitation, allowing Melbourne to continue as prime minister. The subsequent crisis damages Victoria's popularity, leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public. The loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters. She invites Albert to England and proposes marriage.
Victoria and Albert have a loving marriage, but Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness in the household. Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow Albert to take on more duties, which he does. He reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds. He also becomes Victoria's primary adviser, rejecting the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold. He overreaches when he goes over Victoria's head in a matter with parliamentary politics, leading to a fierce argument between the two. One morning, while riding in a carriage together, Victoria is fired upon by a would-be assassin. Albert shields her, and his bravery leads to their reconciliation.
The final title card explains that Victoria and Albert had nine children. Their descendants are the royal families of Britain, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Yugoslavia, Russia, Greece, Romania and Germany. They reigned together for 20 years. Albert died from typhoid fever at age 42. In memory of him, Victoria had his clothes laid out every day until her death at the age of 81. Victoria and Albert championed reforms in education, welfare and industry. They also supported arts and sciences that were celebrated in the Great Exhibition of 1851. Victoria remains the longest reigning British monarch to date.","stylized,sentimental,sincere,touching",305.jpg,2009-02-05, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/the-young-victoria/id364212254?uo=4,jqhBAEslQD0,,,Drama

","Awkward and shy 16-year-old high-schooler Ted Stroehmann (Ben Stiller) lands a prom date with his dream girl Mary Jensen (Cameron Diaz), only to have it cut short by a painful and embarrassing zipper accident. After the ordeal garners the attention of numerous members of the household and community, Ted is finally carted off to the hospital. He subsequently loses touch with Mary.
Thirteen years later, Ted is still in love ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ maybe even obsessed ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ with Mary. On the advice of his best friend Dom, he hires private detective Pat Healy to track her down. Healy finds that she is an orthopedic surgeon living in Miami with her friend, Magda, but Healy falls in love with the irresistible Mary as well. Healy resorts to lying, cheating, stalking, and drugging Magda's dog to win Mary but is exposed by Mary's architect friend, Tucker, who is heavily reliant on crutches and speaks with an English accent. Tucker, however, turns out to be a fraud himself, as he is an able-bodied and entirely American pizza delivery boy who is also in love with Mary. Tucker drives potential rivals away by slander, among them Brett Favre (the football star, playing himself).
Ted, aided by Dom, drives down to Florida to reconnect with Mary. Ted seems to have won Mary's love, until an anonymous letter exposes his being less than honest about his link to Healy. While Ted confronts Healy and Tucker, Mary is confronted by Dom, who turns out to be her former boyfriend Woogie, who ""got weird on her"" back in high school, setting up the original prom scenario. Having found out that Tucker also lied about Mary's former love interest, football player Brett Favre, Ted decides that Mary should be with Brett (who was the only one of the suitors who did not resort to deceit to win Mary). After reuniting Brett and Mary, Ted leaves tearfully. But Mary chases after Ted, saying that she would be happiest with him.
The film concludes with the two engaging in a kiss while a guitarist (Jonathan Richman), who periodically narrated the story in song as a Greek chorus throughout the film, is accidentally shot by Magda's boyfriend who was trying to shoot Ted so he could win over Mary.","drive-in,choke the chicken,taboo,braces,stupid,blow job,goofy,good ship,lie,sperm,first love,surveillance,retards,loser,masturbation,oyster shucker,prom,desperate,gross out comedy,semen,shit dont stink,electronic eavesdropping,whoop-ass,politically incorrect,obsessive love,greatest girl ,obsession,gross out humor,eavesdropping,private detective,mental retardation,politically incorrect,screwball comedy,idiot,penis caught in zipper,love triangle,fellatio,love at first sight,zipper accident,gel,ejaculation,dog,fucking liar,wank,seven eleven,semen in hair,stupidity,pain,vibrator,bad luck,accident,dick,crude humor,cpr on animal,flashback,loaded gun,penis injury,high school,dental braces,dream girl,seven chipmonks,fuckin liar,seven,dating,7-minute abs,zipper,hair gel,miami florida,seven dwarfes",746.jpg,1998-07-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/theres-something-about-mary/id278416833?uo=4,eGjXwDYpOLE,,,Comedy

Set in the 1950s, this moving drama tells the story of a young boy and his divorced mother who travel cross country in hopes of a better life. When his mother marries, the boy must struggle to endure a hostile and complex relationship with his tyrannical new stepfather while coming to terms with his own hopes and dreams. Newsweek called this film ""stunning, smart, moving and made with passion. This is well crafted Hollywood filmmaking in full bloom.""","Nomadic, flaky Caroline Wolff (Ellen Barkin) just wants to settle down in one place, find a decent man, and provide a better home for her and her son, Toby (Leonardo DiCaprio). When she moves to Seattle and meets the seemingly respectable Dwight Hansen (Robert De Niro) (in real life Dwight Thompson worked as a mechanic for Seattle City Light at the time), she thinks she has got it made. Toby, however, feels differently after Dwight's true personality is revealed after spending a few months with Dwight and his children away from Caroline. The boy's stepfather-to-be seems to want to mold Toby into a better person, but his method includes emotionally, verbally, and physically abusing the boy.
The marriage proceeds, and soon Caroline, too, recognizes Dwight's need to dominate everyone around him. She sticks with it, though, convinced it is the best thing for her son, and several years of dysfunction ensue. During this time, Toby befriends a classmate, the misfit and ambiguously homosexual, Arthur Gayle (Jonah Blechman). Toby continues to chafe under the yoke of his repressive stepfather. Hoping to leave Concrete and live with his older brother Gregory, Toby decides to apply for east-coast prep-school scholarships. Realizing his grades are not adequate to apply, Toby devises a plan to submit falsified grade reports. Meanwhile, the friendship between Arthur and Toby becomes strained when Arthur confronts Toby regarding his behavior; Arthur tells Toby he is acting more and more like Dwight and asks Toby, ""why should you be the one who gets to leave?"" Even so, Arthur helps his friend get the papers Toby needs to falsify his grade records and Toby sends in his prep-school applications. When Toby tells Arthur he can leave Concrete and have a better life too, Arthur tells him he will most likely stay. After numerous rejections, Toby is accepted to the Hill School in Pottstown, Pennsylvania with a full scholarship.
At the end of the film following two years of marriage, Caroline defends Toby during a physically violent argument between her son and husband and they are both seen leaving Dwight and Concrete. The real Dwight died in 1992. Caroline got remarried to a good man and lives in Florida. Arthur left Concrete after all, and became a successful businessman in Italy. Dwight's children all married and lived in Seattle.","loveless marriage,small town,homosexual,marital abuse,teenage boy,abusive stepfather,disciplinarian,child driving car,single mother,concrete,brutality,domestic violence,complaining,teen angst,single parent,friendship,savage,family relationships,blechman,dysfunctional family,gay teenager,marriage,melancholy,compassion,gay kiss,mechanic,seattle washington,coming of age,1950s,washington state,poverty,reflection,gay friend,child abuse,troubled teen,pearl",431.jpg,1993-04-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/this-boys-life/id402395807?uo=4,yNzquJsDLOE,60027475,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/This_Boy_s_Life/60027475,Drama

1784,Thor,"The epic adventure THOR spans the Marvel universe from present-day Earth to the cosmic realm of Asgard. At the center of the story is The Mighty Thor, a powerful but arrogant warrior whose reckless actions reignite an ancient war. As a result, Thor is banished to Earth where he is forced to live among humans. When the most dangerous villain of his world sends its darkest forces to invade Earth, Thor learns what it takes to be a true hero.","In AD 965, Odin, king of Asgard, wages war against the Frost Giants of Jotunheim and their leader Laufey, to prevent them from conquering the nine realms, starting with Earth. The Asgardian warriors defeat the Frost Giants and seize the source of their power, the Casket of Ancient Winters.
In the present, Odin's son Thor prepares to ascend to the throne of Asgard, but is interrupted when Frost Giants attempt to retrieve the Casket. Against Odin's order, Thor travels to Jotunheim to confront Laufey, accompanied by his brother Loki, childhood friend Sif and the Warriors Three: Volstagg, Fandral and Hogun. A battle ensues until Odin intervenes to save the Asgardians, destroying the fragile truce between the two races. For Thor's arrogance, Odin strips his son of his godly power and exiles him to Earth as a mortal, accompanied by his hammer Mjolnir, now protected by an enchantment that allows only the worthy to wield it.
Thor lands in New Mexico, where astrophysicist Jane Foster, her assistant Darcy Lewis and mentor Dr. Erik Selvig, find him. The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's data about the wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed but he finds himself unable to lift it, and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane.
Loki discovers that he is actually Laufey's son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin falls into the deep ""Odinsleep"" to recover his strength. Loki seizes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing Heimdall, gatekeeper of the Bifr‚àö‚àÇst‚Äö√Ñ√Æthe means of traveling between worlds‚Äö√Ñ√Æto allow them passage to Earth. Aware of their plan, Loki sends the Destroyer, a seemingly indestructible automaton, to pursue them and kill Thor. The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjolnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Jane goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.
In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr‚àö‚àÇst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr‚àö‚àÇst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki allows himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; while on Earth, Jane and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.
In a post-credits scene, Selvig has been taken to a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility, where Nick Fury opens a briefcase and asks him to study a mysterious object, which Fury says may hold untold power. An invisible Loki prompts Selvig to agree, and he does.","agent garrett,alternate world,humility,super strength,exile,hammer,stylized,unworthy,banishment,thor,gym,tool box,robin hood,brother against brother,odin,exciting,heir to throne,volstagg,battle,marvel,body building,xena,laufey,throne,nail,asgard,bifrost,apathy,fandral,arrogance,hero,jotunheim,scientist,lord of the rings,father son relationship,superhero,warrior,earth,humorous,jackie chan,planet,loki,diy,electrocution,weapon,immortal,god,human alien,rivalry over throne,comic",1784.jpg,2011-05-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/thor/id457161240?uo=4,uHBnrJowBZE,70141586,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Thor/70141586,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

951,Three Days of the Condor,"A bookish CIA researcher finds all his co-workers dead, and must outwit those responsible until he figures out who he can really trust.
Joe Turner, code name Condor, works as a reader for Section 17 - fronting as the American Literacy Historical Society - of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The section's readers read everything that is published to see if the material is being used or planted by national security agencies for the US or enemy regimes in actual operations. The office for the section, which is comprised of eight people in total, is located in a nondescript but secure building in New York City. After returning to the office from a lunch food run for which he initially left the building through an unofficial entrance/exit, Condor finds that all six of his colleagues at work that day, including his girlfriend Janice Chon, have been executed, their dead bodies strewn throughout the office. The seventh has been murdered in his home. Not knowing any of his superiors outside the section, Condor slowly begins not to trust the organization itself. After a botched attempt to bring him in, Condor decides to go on the run and try and figure out what is happening on his own. In his quest, Condor kidnaps a young, seemingly lonely woman named Kathy Hale, who, despite being scared by what is happening, eventually believes Condor's story and decides to help him. He also believes the executions have something to do with the tall Alsatian accented man he keeps encountering, and the last report he wrote and submitted to his superiors outside the section.

","Joe Turner (Robert Redford) is a CIA employee (Condor is his code name) who works in a clandestine office in New York City. He reads books, newspapers, and magazines from around the world, looking for hidden meanings and new ideas. As part of his duties, Turner files a report to CIA headquarters on a low-quality thriller novel his office has been reading, pointing out strange plot elements therein, and the unusual assortment of languages into which the book has been translated.
On the day in which Turner expects a response to his report, a group of armed men, led by an Alsatian assassin later identified as Joubert (Max von Sydow), executes the six people in the office. Turner escapes death because at the moment of the incursion, he was out of the office getting lunch. Realizing he is in danger when he returns to the office and discovers his coworkers' bodies, Turner calls the CIA's New York headquarters, and is given instructions to meet some agents who will take care of him. The meeting, however, is a trap, and Turner escapes an attempt to kill him.
Needing a place to hide, Turner forces a woman, Kathy Hale (Faye Dunaway), whom he sees randomly in a ski shop, to take him to her apartment in Brooklyn Heights. He holds her prisoner while he attempts to figure out what's going on. However, his hiding place is discovered. A hitman, disguised as a postman with a parcel that must be signed for, shows up at the apartment. Turner opens the door and a fight ensues. Turner kills the hitman.
Realizing that he cannot trust anyone within the CIA, Turner begins to play a cat-and-mouse game with Higgins (Cliff Robertson), deputy director of the CIA's New York division. With the help of Hale, Turner abducts Higgins, who reveals through questioning that the killer was a Frenchman named Joubert.
Higgins discovers that the postman who attacked Turner in Hale's apartment was a former U.S. Marine Corps Gunnery Sergeant and CIA operative who had collaborated with Joubert on a previous operation. That operation's mastermind, however, is revealed to be Leonard Atwood (Addison Powell), the CIA Deputy Director of Operations and Higgins' superior.
Meanwhile, using material he found on the fake postman's body, Turner finds where Joubert is staying, then uses his skills as a former telephone lineman to trace a call Joubert makes from his hotel room. He then finds the name and address of the person Joubert called: Atwood. Turner confronts Atwood at his home late at night and questions him at gunpoint. Turner learns that the report he had filed had uncovered a secret plan to take over Middle East oil fields, setting in motion the deaths of all of his section's members.
Joubert surprises them, takes away Turner's pistol, and unexpectedly kills Atwood. The contract has now changed: even though Atwood had hired Joubert to terminate Turner before, Atwood's superiors have now hired Joubert to terminate Atwood. Turner is dumbfounded, realizing that Joubert and he are on the same side, working once again for the CIA. Joubert is disarmingly courteous, suggesting that Turner leave the country, even become an assassin himself since Turner had shown such resourcefulness in staying alive. Turner rejects the suggestions, but seems to take seriously Joubert's warning that the CIA will still try to kill him. Joubert even muses aloud on how Turner's killing would likely be carried out.
Turner goes back to New York City and meets Higgins on a busy street. Higgins defends the oil fields plan, claiming that there will be a day in which oil shortages will cause a major economic crisis for the country. And when that day comes, Americans will want the government to use any means necessary to obtain the oil. Turner says he has told the press ""a story"" (they are standing outside The New York Times office), but Higgins questions Turner's assurances that the story will be printed. After a brief dialogue, an anxious Turner glances at Higgins and The New York Times office, then hastily walks away. The final shot is a freeze frame of Turner passing behind a Salvation Army band singing Christmas carols, while looking over his shoulder back at Higgins.","suspenseful,tense",951.jpg,1975-09-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/three-days-of-the-condor/id352882601?uo=4,PBZf7vifXmY,,,"Classics,Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Romance"

925,Tin Cup,"A washed up golf pro working at a driving range tries to qualify for the US Open in order to win the heart of his successful rival's girlfriend.
Roy 'Tin cup' McAvoy, a failed pro golfer who lives at the run-down driving range which he manages with his sidekick and caddy Romeo in the West Texas tin pot town of Salome, ends up signing over ownership to a madam of 'show girls' to pay off debts. His foxy novice golf pupil, female psychiatrist Dr. Molly Griswold, turns out to be the new girlfriend of McAvoy's sarcastic one-time college golf partner, slick PGA superstar David Simms, who drops by to play into Roy's fatal flaw: the inability to resist a dare, all too often causing him to lose against lesser players, in this case gambling away his car. Falling for Molly, Roy decides to become her patient; in order to earn her respect, he decides to try to qualify for the US Open, after starting off as Simm's caddy 'for the benefit of his experience'. His talent proves more then adequate, but over-confident negligence of risks, while pleasing the crowds, is murder on his scores, while Simms spits on the fans but never wastes a point.

","Roy ""Tin Cup"" McAvoy (Kevin Costner) is a former golf prodigy who has little ambition. He owns a driving range in West Texas, where he drinks and hangs out with his pal Romeo Posar (Cheech Marin) and their friends. Dr. Molly Griswold (Rene Russo), a clinical psychologist, wants a golf lesson. She asks Roy because he knows her boyfriend David Simms (Don Johnson), a top professional golfer. Roy is immediately attracted, but she sees through his charm and resists.
Simms shows up at Roy's trailer ahead of a local benefit tournament. Roy thinks Simms is offering him an invitational spot to play, but Simms actually wants to hire him as a caddy (since Roy knows the course). During the round, Roy needles Simms about ""laying up"" instead of having the nerve to go for the green, 230 yards away over a water hazard. Simms fires back that Roy's problem is playing recklessly instead of playing the percentages. Roy brags that he could make it, and spectators make bets among themselves that Roy could. Simms warns Roy that he'll fire him if he tries, but Roy does anyway, making a brilliant shot.
To get even, Roy decides to try to qualify for the U.S. Open. He also makes a play for Molly, seeking her professional help. Molly agrees to help Roy rebuild his self-confidence in exchange for the golf lessons. In two qualifying rounds, with Romeo as caddy, Roy's golf is excellent but his head needs help. He continues to resist playing safely, smashing most of his clubs (leaving only his 7-iron intact) in a snit that causes Romeo to quit, but still manages to qualify. Following the round, he makes a wager with Simms that costs him his car. He persuades Romeo to go along as caddy, but develops a problem with his golf swing. On the first day of the tournament in North Carolina he shoots a horrible 83. Meanwhile, Molly gets a glimpse of Simms' unpleasant side when he arrogantly refuses to give a child an autograph.
Molly sees that trying to change Roy is a mistake and encourages him to be himself. At her suggestion, Roy wins another silly wager with Simms, the leader after the first round. Then with renewed confidence, ""Tin Cup,"" a nobody from nowhere, shocks the golf world with a remarkable record second round of 62, making the cut. His third round is also excellent and moves him into contention. His flaw, though, is that on all three rounds, he refused to lay up on the par-5 18th hole, hitting the ball into the pond.
On the last day, Roy, Simms and real-life PGA Tour pro Peter Jacobsen (playing himself) are in a three-way battle to be the Open's Champion. Jacobsen finishes with a par on 18, tied for the lead with Roy and one shot ahead of Simms. Simms yet again lays up at the 18th hole, playing it safe. Roy should do likewise, but over Romeo's objections and urged by Molly to ""go for it,"" he takes his fateful shot which finally carries the green. However, a ""little gust from the Gods"" causes his ball to roll back into the pond. Reminiscent of his blow-up back in college when he failed to qualify for the Tour, Roy tries to hit the same shot repeatedly, with the same heart-breaking result. With one last ball in his bag, Roy risks not only being humiliated but being disqualified (having no golf balls to play with), but still goes for the green. On his 12th shot, the ball clears the water and slowly rolls into the hole. After a wild celebration, Roy finally realizes what he has done and feels ashamed of himself, but Molly assures him. ""Five years from now nobody will remember who won or lost, but they're gonna remember your 12!""
Now back in Texas, Molly tells Roy that by finishing in the top 15 at the Open he automatically qualifies to play again next year. She further suggests that he go back to the qualifying school so he can get on the Tour. Molly, who picked up a bunch of new clients at the tournament, prepares for a career of helping players with the mental portion of the game. They kiss passionately as the movie ends.

7322,"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy","In the bleak days of the Cold War, espionage veteran George Smiley is forced from semi-retirement to uncover a Soviet agent within MI6.
In the early 1970s during the Cold War, the head of British Intelligence, Control, resigns after an operation in Budapest, Hungary goes badly wrong. It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian agent - a mole - and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.

","In October 1973, Control, the head of British Intelligence (""the Circus""), sends agent Jim Prideaux to Budapest in Communist Hungary to meet a Hungarian general who had promised to deliver valuable information. However, Prideaux is shot and captured by Soviet agents. Amid the international incident that follows, Control and his right-hand man George Smiley are forced into retirement. Control, already ill, dies soon afterwards.
Percy Alleline becomes the new Chief of the Circus, with Bill Haydon as his deputy and Roy Bland and Toby Esterhase as close allies. They initiate a secretive operation called ""Witchcraft"" to obtain valuable Soviet intelligence. Control and Smiley had distrusted this project. Witchcraft material is being shared with the US, in exchange for valuable American intelligence.
Smiley is brought out of retirement by Oliver Lacon, the civil servant in charge of intelligence, to investigate a claim by Ricki Tarr, an MI6 operative thought to have defected, that there has been a long-term mole in a senior role in British Intelligence. Control had held this suspicion as well. Working outside of the Circus, Smiley chooses a few men and begins to interview people who left the Circus about the same time as he and Control did.
One is Connie Sachs, who had been sacked by Alleline after claiming that Alexei Polyakov, a Soviet cultural attach‚àö¬© in London, was a Soviet spy. Another is Jerry Westerby, who had been duty clerk on the night Prideaux was shot. Westerby says that on that night he called Smiley's house for instructions, but Ann, Smiley's wife at the time, had answered. Shortly after, Haydon arrived at the Circus and said that he saw the news on the tickertape at his club. Smiley realizes that Haydon must have heard the news from Ann, confirming his suspicion that the two had been having an affair.
Smiley comes home and finds Tarr hiding there. Tarr tells him that he had been sent to Istanbul to investigate a Soviet agent named Boris. Tarr found that Boris had no significance, but that Boris's wife Irina was also an operative and seemed to have information. So Tarr overstayed in Istanbul and started having an affair with Irina to gain her trust. Irina, however, knew who Tarr was, and asked to trade the information ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ that a mole working for a KGB spymaster named Karla existed in the top ranks of the Circus ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ for a new life in the West.
Tarr sent Irina's request back to London, but the reply did not come for several hours. The reply ignored Irina's request and said to come home immediately. Tarr then finds that Boris, as well as the British station chief in Istanbul, have been killed. Tarr saw Irina captured and being taken back to Russia, and was subsequently accused of defecting and of murdering the British station chief, so he went into hiding.
Smiley tells Peter Guillam, an officer at the Circus who is secretly aiding Smiley's investigation, to steal the Circus logbook for the night Tarr called: he finds the pages for that night are cut out, suggesting that Tarr's story is true.
Smiley finds Prideaux, who was secretly returned by the Russians but sacked from the service, and is now in hiding, disguised as a language teacher at a boys' school. Prideaux reveals that the purpose of the Hungary mission was to get the name of the mole. Control had codenamed the suspects ""Tinker"" (Alleline), ""Tailor"" (Haydon), ""Soldier"" (Bland), ""Poorman"" (Esterhase) and ""Beggarman"" (Smiley himself). Prideaux tells how he was brutally interrogated and gave in, and also how he saw a blonde female prisoner (Irina) being shot in front of him. However, says Prideaux, the Soviets already knew of Control's investigation into the mole, and were only interested in finding out how far that investigation had progressed.
Smiley learns that Alleline, Haydon, Bland, and Esterhase have been regularly meeting Polyakov ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the ""Witchcraft"" source ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ at a safe house to get material. At every meeting, Polyakov gives these men supposedly high-grade Soviet intelligence in exchange for low-grade British material that helps him maintain his cover with the Soviets. In reality, however, one of these men is the mole, and is passing along substantive material, including American intelligence, and Polyakov is his handler. The material Polyakov passes along is mostly ""chicken feed,"" with just enough substance to persuade the Americans to share information with the British.
Smiley gets the safe house's location by threatening to deport Esterhase, who was formerly Hungarian and would surely be treated as a traitor there. Smiley then sets a trap by having Tarr appear at the Paris office announcing he knows who the mole is and is ready to give the name. The mole hears this, and immediately arranges with Polyakov to meet at the safe house to ask the Soviets to kill Tarr. Smiley waits at the safe house and captures the mole: Haydon.
At the Circus interrogation center in Sarratt, Haydon reveals that he seduced Smiley's wife on Karla's orders, in order to distort any suspicions Smiley may have had of Haydon. Haydon also reveals that Prideaux confided in him about Control's suspicion of a mole right before Prideaux left for Hungary, since they were close friends. The Circus makes plans to exchange Haydon back to the Soviets, but Prideaux, having learned of how Haydon betrayed him, kills him. Smiley is restored to the Circus as its chief.","mi6,covert,deceit,spy,lie",7322.jpg,2011-09-16,,Aco15ScXCwA,70202128,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Tinker_Tailor_Soldier_Spy/70202128,

Stark was looking for a fresh new talent to star in a film adaptation of Richard Mason's novel The World Of Suzie Wong, and he was had a hunch eighteen-year-old Ka Shen was the sort of woman he was looking for. After several screen tests, Ka Shen won the role of Suzie Wong, and took the stage name Nancy Kwan. The World Of Suzie Wong earned Kwan an Academy Award nomination and made her an overnight star; at a time when most Asian actors were stuck playing demeaning, stereotyped roles (and many roles for Asians were played by Caucasian actors in make-up), Kwan became one of Hollywood's first Asian stars and a big-screen sex symbol. Kwan's next picture was a box-office smash, a screen version of the hit Broadway musical Flower Drum Song, and Kwan worked steadily in major studio productions through the 1960s. In 1972, Kwan moved back to Hong Kong to look after her ailing father and ended up staying ten years, continuing to act while also launching a new career as a producer. Filmmaker Brian Jamieson offers an intimate look as Nancy Kwan's private and professional lives in the documentary To Whom It May Concern: Ka Shen's Journey, which features extensive interviews with Kwan as well as Sandra Allen, Joan Chen, France Nuyen and Vivian Wu. The film received its world premiere at the 2010 Cinequest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi",,880.jpg,2010-12,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/to-whom-it-may-concern-ka/id546993034?uo=4 ,,,,"Documentary,Special Interest"

559,Tokyo Drifter,"After his gang disbands, a yakuza enforcer looks forward to life outside of organized crime but soon must become a drifter after his old rivals attempt to assassinate him.
In this jazzy gangster film, reformed killer Phoenix Tetsu‚Äö√Ñ√¥s attempt to go straight is squashed when his former cohorts call him back to Tokyo to help battle a rival gang. This onslaught of stylized violence and trippy colors got director Seijun Suzuki in trouble with Nikkatsu studio heads, who were put off by his anything-goes, in-your-face aesthetic, equal parts Russ Meyer, Samuel Fuller, and Nagisa Oshima. Tokyo Drifter‚Äö√Ñ√¥s a delirious highlight of the brilliantly excessive Japanese cinema of the sixties.

2404,Too Big to Fail,"Chronicles the financial meltdown of 2008 and centers on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.
A close look behind the scenes, between late March and mid-October, 2008: we follow Richard Fuld's benighted attempt to save Lehman Brothers; conversations among Hank Paulson (the Secretary of the Treasury), Ben Bernanke (chair of the Federal Reserve), and Tim Geithner (president of the New York Fed) as they seek a private solution for Lehman's; and, back-channel negotiations among Paulson, Warren Buffet, investment bankers, a British regulator, and members of Congress as almost all work to save the U.S. economy. By the end, with the no-strings bailout arranged, modest confidence restored on Wall Street, and a meltdown averted, Paulson wonders if banks will lend.

","In the mid-2000s, Wall Street was booming: record high bonuses, multimillion-dollar salaries, a skyrocketing housing market. But in 2008, it all came crashing down--and brought the U.S. economy to the brink of collapse. From Oscar(R)-winning director Curtis Hanson and based on Andrew Ross Sorkin's bestseller comes this gripping drama about the financial crisis of 2008 and the inner sanctum of men and women who decided the fate of the world's economy in a matter of a few weeks. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Timothy Geithner are three of the figures who played key roles in preventing a global meltdown unlike anything seen before.

Oscar-winning director Curtis Hanson (8 Mile, L.A. Confidential) adapts author Andrew Ross Sorkin's penetrating expose of the 2008 Wall Street financial crisis in this made-for-HBO docudrama featuring an all-star cast. As the U.S. economy hits the skids, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson (William Hurt) finds himself caught up in a critical battle of wills between the key players on Wall Street, and the powers that be in Washington, D.C. With just weeks to go before the country plunges into the most devastating financial crash since the Great Depression, the powerbrokers on both sides scramble to pull the failing economy back from the brink of disaster.

7344,Top Gun,"Maverick is a hot pilot. When he encounters a pair of MiGs over the Persian Gulf, his wingman is clearly outflown and freaks. On almost no fuel, Maverick is able to talk him back down to the Carrier. When his wingman turns in his wings, Maverick is moved up in the standings and sent to the Top Gun Naval Flying School. There he fights the attitudes of the other pilots and an old story of his father's death in combat that killed others due to his father's error. Maverick struggles to be the best pilot, stepping on the toes of his other students and in a different way to Charlie, a civilian instructor to whom he is strongly attracted. 

It all started when Jerry Bruckheimer saw an article in California Magazine. Titled `Top Guns', plural, it told of the Navy's Elite Fighter Weapons School in Miramar, San Diego, a training ground where the best of the best went to get better. Bruckheimer flipped the article on to partner Don Simpson's desk: ""It's Star Wars... On Earth.""

Two decades on, Bruckheimer's glib analogy now seems especially fitting. Like Star Wars, Top Gun only fires on all cylinders for viewers of a certain age. You weren't born between 1968-73? Then you missed the moment. Sure, you'll still appreciate the standout dogfights, backlit F-14s spinning and plummeting at Mach-2, the pilots' hair on fire, but you'll choke at the cheesy love scene, the even cheesier music and the Stilton-stinky politics. If you were a teenager upon the movie's 1986 release, however, none of that matters. No, scratch that. It does matter: the so-blue-it-could-be-underwater sex scene, shuddering synthesisers and black-visored Russkies adding to the camp glory that is Top Gun, the high-concept Action & Adventureer of the terrifically tacky '80s.

The plot is drafted straight from the nearest sports movie, locker scenes intact, as Tom Cruise's cocky Maverick battles Val Kilmer's phlegmatic Ice Man for the Top Gun trophy. There are a couple of uniform sub-plots, too: Maverick woos Kelly McGillis's sizzling flight instructor with his fancy moves and looks wounded-but-virile in pristine Y-fronts as he mourns for best buddy Anthony Edwards.

Yet for all Bruckheimer and Simpson's insistences that Top Gun should, as they put it, ""play to Momma and Poppa in Oklahoma"", it's a movie with energy to burn. It made Cruise a superstar. It introduced us to a bubbly Meg Ryan (""Take me to bed or lose me forever!""). And its gleaming, high-voltage visuals earned Tony Scott his directorial wings - not to mention his own office on the Paramount lot - after the fussy flop that was lesbian-vampire flick The Hunger.

All this and a volleyball sequence so slick, so well-oiled, it was voted `favourite scene in the movies' by Suck Magazine. Three years running. Take my breath away, indeed.

As students at the Navy's elite fighter weapons school compete to be best in the class, one daring young flyer learns a few things from a civilian instructor that are not taught in the classroom.

Writers: Jim Cash, Jack Epps Jr.
Stars: Tom Cruise, Tim Robbins, Kelly McGillis","United States Naval Aviator Lieutenant Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) flies the F-14A Tomcat off USS Enterprise (CVN-65), with Radar Intercept Officer (""RIO"") Lieutenant (Junior Grade) Nick ""Goose"" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards). At the start of the film, wingman ""Cougar"" (John Stockwell) and his radar intercept officer ""Merlin"" (Tim Robbins), intercept MiG-28s over the Indian Ocean. During the engagement, one of the MiGs manages to get missile lock on Cougar. While Maverick realizes that the MiG ""(would) have fired by now"", if he really meant to fight, and drives off the MiGs, Cougar is too shaken afterward to land, despite being low on fuel. Maverick defies orders and shepherds Cougar back to the carrier, despite also being low on fuel. After they land, Cougar retires (""turns in his wings""), stating that he has been holding on ""too tight"" and has lost ""the edge"", almost orphaning his newborn child who he has never seen. Although disapproving of Maverick's reckless flying and repeated violation of rules, the Enterprise's Commander, Air Group ""Stinger"" (James Tolkan) sends him and Goose‚Äö√Ñ√Ænow his top crew‚Äö√Ñ√Æto attend the Top Gun school at NAS Miramar.
Maverick flies recklessly partially because of his father, Duke Mitchell, a Naval Aviator with VF-51 aboard the USS Oriskany (CV-34) during the Vietnam War. The elder Mitchell died on November 5, 1965 when his McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was shot down, and the official story, which Maverick refuses to believe, is that Duke made a mistake. Goose is cautious and devoted to his wife, Carole (Meg Ryan), and child. The two officers are nonetheless close friends and effective partners, with Goose as the only family Maverick has. At a bar the day before the Top Gun program starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman by singing ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"". He learns the next day that she is Charlotte ""Charlie"" Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), a civilian contractor described as having a Ph.D. in Astrophysics (the study of the physics of celestial objects, rather than the more plausible aeronautical engineering) and civilian Top Gun instructor.
Maverick's reckless flying both annoys and impresses Lieutenant Commander Rick ""Jester"" Heatherly (Michael Ironside) and other instructors. He defeats Jester in combat, but violates two rules of engagement in the process. He continues to pursue Charlie and becomes a rival to top student LT Tom ""Iceman"" Kasansky (Val Kilmer)‚Äö√Ñ√Æwho considers Maverick's methods dangerous and unsafe. Although outwardly critical of Maverick's tactics, Charlie eventually admits that she admires his flying but was critical because she was afraid for her credibility. They begin a romantic relationship.
During one flight, Maverick breaks off from his wingman ""Hollywood"" to go one-on-one with chief instructor Commander Mike ""Viper"" Metcalf (Tom Skerritt), described as ""the (finest) fighter pilot... in the world"". Although Maverick matches the older pilot move for move, Viper lasts long enough for Jester‚Äö√Ñ√Æwho has defeated Hollywood off-screen‚Äö√Ñ√Æto maneuver around and ""shoot"" Maverick down, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual ability.
Near the end of the program, Maverick and Iceman both chase Jester, the latter attempting to gain a missile lock on the target. Under intense pressure from Maverick, Iceman breaks off. Maverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, entering a flat spin from which he cannot recover, forcing him and Goose to eject. Goose ejects directly into the jettisoned aircraft canopy and breaks his neck, dying instantly.
Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility, he feels guilty for Goose's death, losing his aggressiveness when flying. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers leaving the Navy. Unsure of his future, he seeks Viper's advice. Viper reveals that he served with Maverick's father in VF-51, and discloses classified details, explaining how Duke stayed in the fight after his F-4 was hit and saved three planes before he died. During the graduation party, Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately report to Enterprise to deal with a ""crisis situation"", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken communications ship, the SS Layton, that has drifted into hostile waters. Maverick and Merlin are assigned to one of two F-14s as back-up for those flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. In the subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs, Hollywood is shot down but manages to eject; Maverick is sortied alone due to catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, they shoot down four MiGs and force the others to flee, and return triumphantly to Enterprise, where the two men, with newfound respect for each other, finally become friends. Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Top Gun as an instructor (which Stinger jokingly expresses horror at the thought of). Later, he is seen tossing Goose's dogtags into the ocean, signifying that he is finally free of the guilt over his death.
Sitting alone in a restaurant in downtown San Diego, Maverick hears ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"" playing on the jukebox and recalls meeting Charlie. She enters the bar and the two reunite.","hong kong,aircraft carrier,dress whites,jester,death of friend,motorcycle,reo speedwagon,rubber dog shit ,jukebox,cant fight this feeling,take my breath away,loverboy,memories,smile,propaganda,nothing's gonna stop us now,harold faltermeyer,aviation,tower fly by,berlin,naval aviation,love confession,turn and burn,viper,cold war,goose,lead me on,great balls of fire,singing,aerial combat,take me to bed or lose me forever,death,top gun,show off,f15,f14,destination unknown,supersonic airplane,pilot,maverick,letting a friend down,mr. mister,confrontation,ducati,the righteous brothers,great balls of fire,marietta,high five,airforce,through the fire,beach volleyball,loving feeling,flying,larry greene,danger zone,dangerous,wing man,bird,miramar,speed,sittin' on the dock of the bay,flight school,best friends,piano playing,vietnam war,loss of confidence,stud,youve lost that lovin feelin,woosh,fighter pilot,polaroid,raised middle finger,the final countdown,fly by,miami sound machine,starship,naval uniform,love,one percent,lieutenant,playing with the boys,kasanzky,accidental death,mighty wings,your ego is writing checks your body can't cash,aerial combat,stink,military discipline,male bonding,mig,heaven in your eyes,kenny loggins,finger,uniform,broken wings,fly,jet fighter,u.s. navy,fighter pilot,you stink,naval officer,son of a bitch,top gun anthem,classified,the power of love,eject,flirting,the need for speed,sun glasses,show me the way home, jerry lee lewis,teena marie , cheap trick,best friend,jesters dead,i feel the need,ejection seat,hollywood,hot summer nights,race bike,jennifer rush,dog tag,damn this kid is good, honey,steve stevens,take my breath away,top secret,warplane,afterburn,otis redding,wingman",7344.jpg,1986-05-16,,qAfbp3YX9F0,1056189,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Top_Gun/1056189,"Romance,Drama,Action & Adventure"

3634,Toy Story 2,"The toys are back in town and ready to play once again on the big screen in Toy Story 2, the exciting sequel to the landmark 1995 animated blockbuster from Disney/Pixar. This comedy-adventure picks up as Andy heads off to Cowboy Camp leaving his toys to their own devices. Things shift into high gear when an obsessive toy collector named Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight), owner of Al's Toy Barn, kidnaps Woody (Tom Hanks). At Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he is a highly valued collectible from a 1950s TV show called ""Woody's Roundup,"" and he meets the other prized toys from that show - Jessie the cowgirl (Joan Cusack), Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete the Prospector (Kelsey Grammer).  Back at the scene of the crime, Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the gang from Andy's room -- Mr. Potato Head (Don Rickles), Slinky Dog (Jim Varney), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and Hamm (John Ratzenberger) -- spring into action to rescue their pal from winding up as a museum piece. The toys get into one predicament after another in their daring race to get Woody home before Andy returns.","Three years after the events in Toy Story, Woody prepares to go to cowboy camp with Andy, but his arm is accidentally ripped. Andy decides to leave him behind, and his mother puts him on the shelf. After Woody has a nightmare about Andy throwing him in a trash full of arms, he discovers that a penguin toy named Wheezy has been on the shelf for months because of a broken squeaker. When Woody saves Wheezy from a yard sale, he is stolen by a toy collector who Buzz Lightyear and the other toys recognize from a commercial as Al McWhiggin, the greedy, avaricious owner of a shop named Al's Toy Barn. Buzz, Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Slinky Dog, and Rex set out to rescue Woody.
In Al's apartment, Woody discovers that he is a valuable collectible based on an old TV show called Woody's Roundup, and is set to be sold to a toy museum in Tokyo, Japan. The other toys from the show - Jessie the yodeling cowgirl, Woody's horse Bullseye, and Stinky Pete the Prospector, are excited about the trip but Woody intends to go home because he is Andy's toy. Jessie, who is afraid of the dark, is upset with him as the museum will only want the whole gang; without him, they will go back into storage. That night, when Woody's whole arm comes off, his attempt to retrieve it and escape is foiled when the TV comes on. Woody, seeing the remote in front of Jessie, accuses her of sabotaging his escape. The following morning, Woody's arm is reconnected and he decides to stay when Jessie reveals that she was once the beloved toy of a child named Emily who eventually outgrew and gave her away and Prospector warns him that the same fate awaits him when Andy grows up.
Buzz and the other toys reach Al's Toy Barn. While searching the store for Woody, Buzz is captured and imprisoned in a box by a newer Buzz Lightyear action figure which thinks itself a real space ranger, as Buzz did in the original film. The new Buzz joins the other toys, who do not notice the switch, as they make their way to Al's apartment. Buzz escapes and pursues them, thinking they have also been captured by Al. When he gets out of Al's Toy Barn, he unknowingly and accidentally releases an action figure of his archenemy Emperor Zurg who follows him. Buzz rejoins the others as they find Woody, who initially refuses to return because he does not want to abandon the rest of the Roundup Gang. After Buzz reminds Woody of ""a toy's true purpose"", and he is moved by seeing himself sing ""You've Got a Friend in Me"" on the television, he changes his mind again and asks the Roundup toys to come with him. However, Stinky Pete prevents their escape and reveals that he wants to go to Tokyo because he spent his life on a dime store shelf and was never sold. To ensure this, he made sure Woody would not go home, and was also responsible for sabotaging his escape the previous night. Al arrives and takes Woody and the Roundup toys with him, forcing both Buzz Lightyears and Andy's toys to follow him. They follow Al to an elevator where they encounter Zurg who fights the new Buzz until he is knocked off the elevator by Rex. When they reach the ground floor, the new Buzz stays to play with Zurg once he discovers that Zurg is his father (echoing The Empire Strikes Back) while Buzz and the other toys continue their pursuit of Al.
Accompanied by three toy Aliens, they steal a Pizza Planet delivery truck and follow Al to Tri-County International Airport where they enter the check-in area, the baggage processing area to find Woody and the Roundup toys. During a fight with Woody, Stinky Pete rips his arm and tries to mutilate him, but is captured and stuffed into a little girl's Barbie backpack by Buzz and the other toys. While Woody and Bullseye are saved, Jessie ends up on the plane for Tokyo. Assisted by Buzz and Bullseye, Woody boards the plane and convinces Jessie to come with them to Andy's house, telling her that he has a little sister. However, the plane starts up before they can escape but they leave through an emergency hatch just as the plane gets onto the runway. Woody lassoes his string over a nut on the plane's wheels, and swings with Jessie between the plane wheels before landing on Bullseye just as the plane takes off. Buoyed up by living ""Woody's Finest Hour,"" the toys go home.
Andy returns home, repairs Woody's arm, and accepts Jessie and Bullseye as his new toys. The toys also learn from a commercial that Al's business has suffered due to his failure to sell the Roundup toys. As Jessie and Bullseye delight in having a new owner, Woody tells Buzz that he is not worried about Andy outgrowing him, because when he does, they will always have each other for company ""for infinity and beyond."" Meanwhile, Wheezy has also been fixed and ends the film with an Elvis style version of ""You've Got a Friend in Me.""","feel good,joy,humorous",3634.jpg,1999-11-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/toy-story-2/id268793231?uo=4,Lu0sotERXhI,,,"Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

But, when a mix-up lands them at Sunnyside Daycare, they meet a host of new toys and soon discover a wild new adventure is just beginning!  Take an amazing journey with some of the most beloved characters in movie history and discover what being a friend is truly all about.","Andy (John Morris) now nearly 18 years old,[11] is leaving for college, and his toys feel like they have been abandoned as they have not been played with for years. Andy decides to take Woody (Tom Hanks) with him to college and puts Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) and the rest of the toys in a trash bag for storage in the attic. However, the toys are accidentally thrown out when Andy's mother (Laurie Metcalf) finds the bag and puts it out on the curb, causing the toys to think that they are no longer wanted. They escape and decide to climb in a donation box for Sunnyside Daycare. Woody, the only toy who saw what actually happened, follows the other toys and tries to explain that they were thrown out by mistake, but they refuse to believe him.
Andy's toys are welcomed by the many toys at Sunnyside and given a tour of the seemingly perfect play-setting by Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear (Ned Beatty) (simply known as Lotso), Big Baby (Woody Smith), and Ken (Michael Keaton), whom Barbie (Jodi Benson) falls in love with. All of the toys love their new home, leaving a steadfast Woody alone in an attempt to return to Andy. Woody's escape attempt falls short and he is found outside by Bonnie (Emily Hahn), an imaginative little girl. She takes him home and plays with him along with her other toys, who are well-treated, happy, and readily welcome Woody. At the daycare, Andy's toys are getting played with very roughly by the rambunctious youngest toddlers.
Buzz goes to ask Lotso to transport him and the other toys to a better room, only to be caught by Lotso's henchmen and restored back to his original space ranger persona. At the same time, Andy's toys realize that Woody was right about Andy when Mrs. Potato Head sees Andy searching for them through her missing eye, which was left behind in Andy's room. Before they could leave, they are imprisoned by Lotso and his gang, including a reset Buzz. Back at Bonnie's, Woody learns from one of the toys, named Chuckles the Clown (Bud Luckey), that Lotso was once a good toy and had an owner named Daisy who also owned Chuckles the Clown and Big Baby. One day, Daisy left them behind on a picnic. The three eventually find their way back to Daisy's house, only to find that she replaced Lotso with an identical teddy bear. When he found Sunnyside, he and Big Baby took it over and ran it like a prison.
The following morning, Woody returns to Sunnyside through Bonnie's backpack and reunites with his friends. That night, the toys execute a daring escape plan, and in the process they accidentally reset Buzz into a delusional Spanish mode, in which his memory remains wiped but he becomes flamboyantly chivalrous; despite this, Buzz allies himself with Woody and immediately falls in love with Jessie (Joan Cusack). The toys reach a dumpster, but are caught by Lotso and his gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals what he learned about Lotso, and Big Baby throws Lotso into the dumpster. Seeking revenge, Lotso pulls Woody into the dumpster just as the truck collects the trash. Woody's friends fall into the back of the truck trying to rescue him and a falling television hits Buzz when he tries to save Jessie, returning him to his normal self. The toys find themselves at the dump and eventually wind up on a conveyor belt leading to a giant incinerator. Woody and Buzz then help Lotso ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ whom they saved earlier ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ reach an emergency stop button, only to have Lotso leave them behind. Believing the end is near, the toys join hands and accept their fate, but are soon rescued by the Aliens (Jeff Pidgeon) operating a large industrial claw. Lotso makes his way outside, but a passing garbage truck driver finds him and, recognizing he had the same toy as a kid, straps him to the radiator grill of his truck. Meanwhile, Woody and his friends board another trash truck driven by an older Sid Phillips (Erik von Detten) back to Andy's house.
In Andy's room, Woody climbs back into the box with Andy's college supplies while the other toys ready themselves for the attic. Woody suddenly has an idea and leaves a note for Andy on the toys' box. Andy, thinking the note is from his mother, takes them to Bonnie's house and introduces her to his old toys. Bonnie recognizes Woody who, to Andy's surprise, is lying at the bottom of the box. Though initially reluctant, Andy happily passes him on to Bonnie, and then spends some time playing with her and the toys before leaving. The film ends with Woody and his friends watching Andy's departure and beginning their new lives with Bonnie.
During the credits, Woody and the other toys learn through notes passed on in Bonnie's backpack that Barbie, Ken and Big Baby have improved the lives of the toys (now including an Emperor Zurg action figure) at Sunnyside. Buzz and Jessie (now a couple) then dance a pasodoble to a Spanish version of ""You've Got a Friend in Me.""","spaceman,cowboy,joy,toys,witty,cool toys,feel good,humorous,childhood",1579.jpg,2010-06-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/toy-story-3/id381438139?uo=4,TNMpa5yBf5o,70116690,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Toy_Story_3/70116690,"Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

In a city where streets are overrun by drug dealers, those who have sworn to uphold the law are breaking them to clean up the streets. Denzel Washington plays L.A.P.D. detective Alonzo Harris, a veteran narcotics officer whose methods of enforcing the law are questionable, if not corrupt.

","The film follows a single day in the life of an Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officer, Jake Hoyt (Hawke), who is scheduled to be evaluated by Detective Alonzo Harris (Washington), a highly decorated LAPD narcotics officer who could advance Jake's career. In Alonzo's car, the pair of officers observes teenage Mara Salvatrucha gang members dealing drugs in a park. Instead of arresting the buyers, Alonzo confiscates the drugs and tells Jake to take a hit from the marijuana. Jake initially refuses, but Alonzo puts a gun to his head and says Jake's failure to use drugs could get him killed by a street dealer.
Jake relents and smokes the marijuana, but shortly thereafter, Alonzo tells him the marijuana was laced with PCP. While driving, Jake notices a female high school student being sexually assaulted by two men in an alley. Jake jumps out to help her and subdues the attackers, but Alonzo refuses to report the incident. He tells the girl to leave, telling Jake that the girl's gang member cousin will seek the attackers out to exact revenge. Jake discovers the girl's wallet on the ground and takes it. Jake objects to Alonzo's use of vigilante ""street justice"", but Alonzo characterizes Jake as na‚àö√òve.
Alonzo and Jake cruise around and are approached by a wheelchair bound drug dealer named Blue (Snoop Dogg). Blue suspects them of being the police and takes off, with them chasing him. When they catch up with him, they then search him, find crack rocks and a loaded handgun on his person, and then interrogate him. In exchange for not being charged, Blue gives them a name, Sandman. They find out Sandman is imprisoned and go to his home in Watts. Alonzo repeatedly delays giving the search warrant to Sandman's wife, which is actually a cover for Alonzo to steal drug money. When they finally give the wife the warrant, just a restaurant take out menu, she becomes belligerent. The wife realizing she has been robbed, calls out to the gang members in the nearby housing projects, and they engage the duo in a firefight. Barely managing to escape, an irate Jake again objects to Alonzo's actions, especially since it could have gotten them killed. The duo then arrive at Baldwin Village to visit Alonzo's El Salvadorian mistress Sara (Eva Mendes) and their young son. Afterward, Alonzo meets with a group of high-ranking police officials dubbed the ""Three Wise Men"" (Tom Berenger, Harris Yulin, and Raymond J. Barry). They tell Alonzo they know he owes money to the Russian Mafia and suggest that he leave town. But Alonzo insists he can control the situation and gets permission from the Wise Men to ""cash in on an account"" with the caveat that he avoid a scandal. Alonzo later tells Jake that he had to give Sandman's money to the Three Wise Men to obtain an arrest warrant.
Alonzo takes Jake and several other narcotic officers to the home of Roger (Scott Glenn), a drug dealer and former police officer the two visited earlier. Using the warrant, they seize several million dollars from underneath the floor of Roger's kitchen, but Jake refuses to take his share of the cash -- much to the suspicion of the other cops. Alonzo then shoots Roger and arranges the scene to appear like a justified shooting. Jake refuses to lie, and after being threatened seizes Alonzo's gun.
A Mexican standoff ensues, with Jake threatening to shoot Alonzo while the other officers threaten to shoot Jake. Alonzo then reveals that the LAPD will run a blood test on Jake following the shooting, thus detecting the PCP he had smoked earlier. Alonzo offers to have the test results falsified in exchange for Jake's cooperation. Jake reluctantly agrees, and Alonzo again urges Jake to drop his na‚àö√òve view of police work.
Alonzo then drives Jake to the home of a gangster named ""Smiley"" (Cliff Curtis), allegedly to run an errand. Alonzo gives Smiley a package containing a large stack of money, which Smiley asks his sister to count while he plays poker with two other gang members. Jake is persuaded to join the game and engages in tense conversation with the three men. After Smiley's sister confirms to him that the count is correct, Smiley receives a message on his phone. Smiley then reveals to Jake that Alonzo has abandoned him, and explains Alonzo's situation: by midnight, Alonzo must pay $1 million to the Russian mob for killing one of their couriers in Las Vegas or be killed himself.
Alonzo has paid Smiley to kill Jake. Jake tries to escape but is overpowered and dragged into the bathroom to be executed. The men search his pockets, finding the wallet he had picked up earlier from the girl he rescued, who is Smiley's cousin. Smiley calls the girl, who confirms that Jake defended her against the attackers. In gratitude for protecting his cousin, Smiley lets Jake go, and asks for no hard feelings because the planned execution was ""just business"".
Jake returns to Sara's apartment looking for Alonzo. He attempts to arrest Alonzo, but Alonzo resists and they fight. Jake eventually subdues him, after which the local gang members and residents begin congregating to watch. Alonzo tries to get the crowd on his side by offering a reward to whoever kills Jake, but they have grown tired of Alonzo's arrogance and allow Jake to walk away with the money.
In his escape to Los Angeles International Airport, Alonzo is surrounded by Russian hitmen who kill him. The final scene has Jake pulling into his driveway and going home to his wife, Lisa (Charlotte Ayanna), and daughter, while a radio broadcast describes Alonzo's death as occurring honorably while ""serving a high-risk warrant near LAX"".","narc,bad cop,lapd,pistol whip,on the job,training,detective,practical,bleak,disturbing,cannabis,street gang,drugs,day of reckoning,do the right thing,corrupt cop,rookie,cynical,drugs,training,corrupt police,bulletproof vest,tense,blackmail,police corruption,narcotics,reality,marijuana,rough,drug dealer,suspenseful,pistol,streetwise,surprise,crack cocaine,atmospheric,street wise,police training",1339.jpg,2001-09-02, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/training-day/id271360192?uo=4,gKTVQPOH8ZA,60021234,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Training_Day/60021234,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

","A long time ago, far away on the planet of Cybertron, a war is being waged between the noble Autobots (led by the wise Optimus Prime) and the devious Decepticons (commanded by the dreaded Megatron) for control over the Allspark, a mystical talisman that would grant unlimited power to whoever possesses it. The Autobots managed to smuggle the Allspark off the planet, but Megatron blasts off in search of it. He eventually tracks it to the planet of Earth (circa 1850), but his reckless desire for power sends him right into the Arctic Ocean, and the sheer cold forces him into a paralyzed state. His body is later found by Captain Archibald Witwicky, but before going into a comatose state Megatron uses the last of his energy to engrave into the Captain's glasses a map showing the location of the Allspark, and to send a transmission to Cybertron. Megatron is then carried away aboard the Captain's ship. A century later, Captain Witwicky's grandson Sam Witwicky (nicknamed Spike by his friends) buys his first car. To his shock, he discovers it to be Bumblebee, an Autobot in disguise who is to protect Spike, who possesses the Captain's glasses and the map engraved on them. But Bumblebee is not the only Transformer to have arrived on Earth - in the desert of Qatar, the Decepticons Blackout and Scorponok attack a U.S. military base, causing the Pentagon to send their special Sector Seven agents to capture all ""specimens of this alien race."" Spike and his girlfriend Mikaela find themselves in the midst of a grand battle between the Autobots and the Decepticons, stretching from Hoover Dam all the way to Los Angeles.

3771,Tropic Thunder,"Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr. lead an ensemble cast in ""Tropic Thunder,"" an action comedy about a group of self-absorbed actors who set out to make the most expensive war film. After ballooning costs force the studio to cancel the movie, the frustrated director refuses to stop shooting, leading his cast into the jungles of Southeast Asia, where they encounter real bad guys.","Hook-handed Vietnam veteran John ""Four Leaf"" Tayback's (Nick Nolte) memoir, Tropic Thunder, is being made into a film. With the exception of newcomer supporting actor Kevin Sandusky (Jay Baruchel), the cast‚Äö√Ñ√Æfading action hero Tugg Speedman (Stiller), five-time Academy Award-winning Australian method actor Kirk Lazarus (Downey, Jr.), rapper Alpa Chino (Brandon T. Jackson), and drug-addicted comedian Jeff Portnoy (Black)‚Äö√Ñ√Æbehave unreasonably. Rookie director Damien Cockburn (Steve Coogan) cannot control them during filming of a large war scene and production is reported to be one month behind schedule. Cockburn is ordered by studio executive Les Grossman (Tom Cruise) to get filming back on track, or risk its cancellation.
Acting on Tayback's advice, Cockburn drops the actors into the middle of the jungle, with hidden cameras and rigged special effects explosions to film ""guerrilla-style"". The actors have guns that fire blanks, along with a map and scene listing that will lead to a helicopter waiting at the end of the route. Unbeknownst to the actors and production, the group have been dropped in the middle of the Golden Triangle, the home of the heroin-producing Flaming Dragon gang. Shortly after the group set off, the five actors are stunned to see Cockburn blown up by an old land mine. Speedman, believing Cockburn faked his death, persuades the others that Cockburn is alive and that they are still shooting the film. Lazarus is unconvinced, but joins them in their trek through the jungle.
When Tayback and pyrotechnics operator Cody Underwood (Danny McBride) attempt to locate the dead director, they are captured by Flaming Dragon, at which point Tayback reveals that he fabricated his memoir and that he has hands. As the actors continue through the jungle, Lazarus and Sandusky discover that Speedman is leading them in the wrong direction. The four actors, tired of walking and hoping to be rescued, leave Speedman, who goes off by himself and is captured by Flaming Dragon. Taken to their heroin factory, Speedman believes it is a POW camp from the script. The gang discovers he is the star of their favorite film, the box office bomb Simple Jack, and force him to reenact it several times a day. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, Speedman's agent Rick Peck (Matthew McConaughey) is trying to negotiate with Grossman an unfulfilled term in Speedman's contract that entitles him to a TiVo. Flaming Dragon calls the two and demands a ransom for Speedman, but Grossman instead berates the gang. Despite the threats, Grossman expresses no interest in rescuing Speedman and attempts to convince Rick about the benefits of allowing Speedman to die and collecting the insurance. Grossman also offers Rick a Gulfstream V and money in return for his cooperation.
Lazarus, Chino, Portnoy, and Sandusky discover Flaming Dragon's heroin factory. After seeing Speedman being tortured, they plan a rescue attempt based on the film's script. Lazarus impersonates a farmer towing a captured Portnoy on the back of a water buffalo, distracting the armed guards so Chino and Sandusky can locate the captives. After the gang notices inconsistencies in Lazarus' story, the actors open fire, temporarily subduing them. When the gang realize they are being guarded by actors, they gather their guns and begin firing. The four actors locate Speedman, Tayback, and Underwood, and cross a bridge rigged to explode to get to their helicopter. Speedman asks to remain behind with the gang which he considers his family, but quickly returns when Flaming Dragon fires in pursuit. Tayback detonates the bridge allowing Speedman to reach safety, but as the helicopter takes off, the gang fires an RPG at the helicopter. Rick unexpectedly stumbles out of the jungle carrying a TiVo box and throws it in the path of the RPG, saving them. The crew return to Hollywood, where footage from the hidden cameras is compiled into a feature film, Tropic Blunder, which becomes a major critical and box office hit. The film wins Speedman his first Academy Award, which Lazarus presents to him at the ceremony.","exploding body,theatrical agent,bayoneted,drug trafficking,actor,southeast asia,disguise,guerilla,film director,thunder,crucified hero pose,drug addiction,talking to me this whole time,exciting,biting,torture,acting,film making,wrong place,napalm,fake trailer,heroin,joy,over acting,uh 1 huey helicopter,drug lord,vietnam,disgust,key grip,satire,land mine,m 16,crude humor,drugs,blow up,offbeat,apocalypse now parody,shot multiple times,vietnam veteran,humorous,film executive,drug addict,closeted homosexual,wrong time,grenade,opium poppy,boom,clever,rpg,rifle",3771.jpg,2008-08-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/tropic-thunder/id291563909?uo=4,VsEdmjAudSI,70097582,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Tropic_Thunder/70097582,Comedy

7317,True Grit,"A tough U.S. Marshal helps a stubborn young woman track down her father's murderer.
Following the murder of her father by hired hand Tom Chaney, 14-year-old farm girl Mattie Ross sets out to capture the killer. To aid her, she hires the toughest U.S. marshal she can find, a man with ""true grit,"" Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn. Mattie insists on accompanying Cogburn, whose drinking, sloth, and generally reprobate character do not augment her faith in him. Against his wishes, she joins him in his trek into the Indian Nations in search of Chaney. They are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, who wants Chaney for his own purposes. The unlikely trio find danger and surprises on the journey, and each has his or her ""grit"" tested.

","Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) explains that her father was murdered by one of his hired hands, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), when she was 14 years old. While collecting her father's body, Mattie queries the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. After being told that Chaney has fled with ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper) and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses to hire Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), whom the sheriff had described as being the ""meanest. "" The taciturn, one-eyed Cogburn rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the reward money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill (Dakin Matthews), who did business with her father.
Meanwhile, Texas Ranger LeBoeuf (Matt Damon) arrives on the trail of Chaney for the murder of a Texas state senator. LeBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, who knows the Choctaw terrain where Chaney is hiding, but Mattie refuses his offer. Mattie wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn to search for Chaney, but Cogburn later leaves without her, having gone with LeBoeuf to apprehend Chaney.
After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LeBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LeBoeuf expresses his displeasure by birching Mattie with a switch rod, but Cogburn eventually stops him. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate States of America ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Cogburn served with Quantrill's Raiders and LeBoeuf with Edmund Kirby Smith ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ Cogburn ends their arrangement and LeBoeuf leaves. Later, while pursuing the Pepper gang that Chaney is reportedly traveling with, the two meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. There they find two outlaws, Quincey (Paul Rae) and Moon (Domhnall Gleeson), and interrogate them. As Moon acquiesces by divulging what he knows to Cogburn, Quincey fatally stabs Moon, before Cogburn shoots Quincey dead. Before dying, Moon says Pepper and his gang will be returning later that night.
Just before the Pepper gang arrives, LeBoeuf arrives at the dugout and is taken hostage. Cogburn, hiding on the hillside with Mattie, shoots and kills two gang members, but Pepper escapes. The next day, Cogburn gets in a drunken argument with LeBoeuf, who departs once again. While getting water from a nearby stream, Mattie encounters Chaney. She shoots him, but he survives and drags her back to Ned, who forces Cogburn to leave by threatening to kill her. Being short a horse, Ned leaves Mattie with Chaney, ordering him not to harm her or he will not get paid after his remount arrives.
Once alone, Chaney disobeys Ned and tries to kill Mattie. LeBoeuf appears and knocks Chaney out, explaining that he rode back when he heard the shots, and he and Cogburn devised a plan. They watch from a cliff as Cogburn takes on the remaining members of Ned's gang, killing two and wounding Ned, before his horse is struck and falls, trapping Cogburn's leg. Before Pepper can kill Cogburn, LeBoeuf shoots and kills Pepper from roughly four hundred yards away. Chaney regains consciousness and knocks LeBoeuf unconscious with a rock. Mattie seizes LeBoeuf's rifle and shoots Chaney dead in the chest. The recoil, however, knocks her into a deep pit containing rattlesnakes. Cogburn arrives, but Mattie is bitten on her hand before he can get to her. Cogburn cuts into her wound to suck out as much of the poison as he can, and then rides day and night to get Mattie to a doctor, carrying her on foot after her horse collapses from exhaustion, finally making his way to Bagby's store.
Twenty-five years later, Mattie (Elizabeth Marvel) ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ now 40, reveals through narration that she had her left forearm amputated due to the gangrene from the snakebite. Cogburn stayed with her at Bagby's until she was out of danger, though he left the store before she regained consciousness. Mattie never saw Cogburn again, despite a letter she wrote to him inviting him to visit and to collect the $50 she still owed him the next time he was near Yell County. She receives a note from Cogburn inviting her to meet him at a traveling Wild West show in which he now performs. She arrives, only to learn that Cogburn died three days earlier. She has his body moved to her family cemetery. Standing over Cogburn's grave, she reflects on her decision to move his remains, and about never having married. She also reveals that she never saw LaBoeuf again, though she would like to, and imagines that some of the starch has probably gone out of his cowlick by now, observing that ""time just gets away from us"".","fireplace,corpse,dogfall,boarding house,yell county,child's point of view,sheriff,lawyer,pit,shot in the forehead,shot in the back,shot in the stomach,shot to death,revenge,spyglass,marshal,doctor,ugly stick,son-of-a-bitch,hanging,futile,sniper,train,pay for everything,crow,the wicked flee when none pursueth,outlaw,undertaker,that didn't pan out.,pony,forest,eye patch,sucking poison,held at gunpoint,cowboy,deal,shotgun,texas ranger,thrown from a horse,alcoholic,criminal,horse,title same as book,court,river,colonel,murder,there is nothing free except the grace of god.,fugitive,gunfight,proverbs,rope,u.s. marshal,trick shooting,cave,spurs,revolver,trial,handgun,child in peril,one-eyed fat man,rifle,mountain,14 year old",7317.jpg,2011-02-11,,CUiCu-zuAgM,70142543,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/True_Grit/70142543,"Western,Drama"

A suburban family is torn apart when fourteen-year-old Annie (Liana Liberato) meets her first boyfriend online. After months of communicating via online chat and phone, Annie discovers her friend (Chris Henry Coffey) is not who he originally claimed to be.

","14-year-old Annie Cameron lives in suburban Chicago. She enjoys a healthy relationship with her family. On her birthday, her parents give her a laptop. She is rather naive in respect of some of the ways in which the Internet can be harmful. When she meets Charlie in an online chat room, she establishes an instant connection with him. At first, Charlie states that he is sixteen years old. Over time, as the two bond by sending phone text messages and through instant messaging, he bumps his age up to 20, then 25. Annie is taken aback at first, but then dismisses these concerns. Her parents are not aware of her infatuation, or the threat Charlie poses, and Annie even deceives them a bit, as she continues the on-line relationship, not wanting to end things with him because she is flattered by the attention. After three months of communicating electronically, Charlie invites Annie to meet him at the mall.
While her parents are delivering Annie's brother to his first semester at college, and taking the orientation tour, Annie goes to the mall and awaits her first face-to-face meeting with Charlie. When he appears, she discovers he is significantly older than he presented himself to be, appearing to be in his late thirties or early forties. Annie is upset about him having lied about his age, but still spends time with him after he compliments and sweet-talks her and convinces her to ignore their age difference, even to the point of driving to a motel with him. Despite the fact that Annie is a minor, Charlie has her model lingerie and proceeds to inappropriately touch her. He soon coaxes her onto the bed and they have consensual, but statutory sex. He secretly films what he does to Annie.
A few days pass, and Annie becomes frantic at not hearing from Charlie. Her behavior changes towards all around her. At school, Brittany, Annie's best friend, deduces Annie had sex, as she had seen her and Charlie that day at the mall. Brittany is concerned about this and notifies the school administration. The police arrive and depart with Annie, drawing unwanted attention from fellow students at her high school. These actions initiate an FBI investigation. The FBI have Annie contact Charlie, in an attempt to identify him, but he figures out the ruse and breaks off contact with her before the FBI can trace his location. Annie's father, Will, starts his own obsessive investigation, taking up the services of a private investigation firm in New Jersey. He even steals a collection of his daughter's chat conversations with Charlie from the FBI. His relationship with his daughter and his wife Lynn begins to deteriorate, and he questions his work at an advertising firm, which uses provocative advertisements involving teenagers. When Will tells his boss that his daughter was sexually assaulted, his boss is shocked but becomes dismissive when told that Annie knew the man and went willingly to the hotel, saying ""it could have been a lot worse.""
Annie, still believing Charlie loves her, is angry at Brittany for not keeping her relationship with Charlie secret, and she is livid at her parents for making her betray him and for forbidding her to contact him anymore. A few more days pass, and although Charlie has not been identified, DNA evidence proves he has behaved in the same manner with other young girls who reported it to the police. This causes Annie to be devastated because she thought she was special, the only girl in his life. After seeing pictures of the other girls, she feels betrayed, and she finally admits to herself, and to her hospital counselor, that she was raped.
The next day, Annie tries to move on with her life by participating in her school's volleyball game. There, Will sees a man in the crowd. Not only is he taking pictures of the girls in the game, but he also looks surprisingly similar to one of the local registered sex offenders a private New Jersey investigation firm provided him pictures with. An irate Will interrupts the game in order to confront the man. He beats him to the floor, causing a scene. A girl in the game reveals the man to be her father. The assaulted man chooses not to press charges for fear that he will be outed to his family. Will apologizes to the man but Annie feels humiliated. At home, Annie confronts her father. Annie insists that she wants to move on with her life. She believes that Will does not fully appreciate her position as the victim.
Annie hears from Brittany about a website in which people are belittling the fact that she was raped. This pushes her over the edge. At home, she locks herself in the bathroom and attempts suicide by overdosing with pills, but is saved by her father. Brittany spends the night to keep her company, mending their broken friendship.
Annie wakes up early the next day, and discovers her father sitting outside in the freezing cold weather. She approaches him, asking if he is all right. Will begins talking to her, reminiscing about the first time she ever got in the family pool, and how brave she was to do it. He tells her that she used to be confident, and nothing frightened her. He admired the way she loved the world and trusted the people in it and how now all that has changed. He weeps and pleads for forgiveness even though he believes he does not deserve it. Annie starts to cry and then embraces him.
As the credits roll, a home video reveals Charlie to be a high school physics teacher named Graham Weston, a married father with a young son.","msn messenger,rape,father daughter conflict,technology,lie,pedophile,chat,child,fake,text messaging,suicide,rape,parenting,instant message,counselor,obsession,teen,teenage girl,best friend,taken advantage,internet chat,parent,father daughter relationship,youth,misunderstanding,anger,social network,lying about age,sadness,yahoo messenger,internet,skype",2662.jpg,2011-04-01, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/trust/id444344783?uo=4,,,,Horror

He starts boxing while at a state detention center; his coach there sends him to Cus D'Amato who becomes trainer, father figure, and confidence builder. Tyson wins a series of championships and, for six years, is unbeatable. A failed marriage, a felony conviction, and lack of training lead to his fall.

","This documentary is a self-discovery of a matured Mike Tyson, who reflects on his highly controversial and publicly viewed life. It begins with clips of 20-year-old Tyson's convincing World Boxing Council Heavyweight Championship win over Trevor Berbick, then explores the fighter's upbringing and motivation. It is revealed that he had a fractured family life and difficult childhood in Brownsville, Brooklyn, where his crimes led him to Tryon School for Boys in Johnstown, New York. A father-son relationship with his first professional trainer and only father figure in his life, Cus D'Amato, is expressed as Tyson chokes back tears. He reveals his vulnerability when he relates the fear that he felt when D'Amato died in 1985. Tyson was only 19 years old when he lost the one real parental figure in his life.
Tyson eventually unified the WBC, WBA and IBF title championship belts, becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion of the world. This turned into a traumatic event that was the root cause of Tyson's many personal issues. Tyson makes it apparent that his great stardom at only the age of 20 was a blessing for him but also a curse. From his great achievements at such a young age to the eventual tangled web of his existence, Tyson is able to expose his contrasting flaws of mental instability, immaturity, lust for women and fear, all of which explain his downfall as a boxer and his controversial life. In the end, having fought a battle with fear in order to fight for his respect, Tyson is shocked by the outcome: a renewed respect for life and family.",,2271.jpg,2008-05,http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/tyson/id323727814?uo=4 ,,,,"Documentary,Sports & Fitness"

","Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) is born with Type I osteogenesis imperfecta, a rare disease in which bones break easily. Drawing on what he has read in comic books during his many hospital stays, Price theorizes that if he is frail at one extreme, then perhaps there is someone ""unbreakable"" at the opposite extreme.
Years later, security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is also searching for meaning in his life. He gave up a promising football career to marry his love Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) after they were involved in an auto accident. However, their marriage is dissolving, to the distress of their young son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). Returning from a job interview in New York, David is the sole survivor of a horrific train wreck that killed 131 passengers, sustaining no injuries himself. He is contacted by the adult Elijah, who proposes to a disbelieving David that he is a real instance of the kind of person after whom comic-book superheroes are modeled. David tries to ignore him, but Elijah stalks him and his wife, trying to get his attention. To relieve his family from further distress, David finally agrees to hear Elijah, and begins to test himself. While lifting weights with Joseph, they discover that his physical strength is far beyond what he previously thought and Joseph begins to idolize his father and believe he is a superhero.
Joseph confronts some bullies at school thinking he might share his dad's abilities, but is injured instead. David tries to console his son by saying that Elijah is wrong and that he is just as normal as everyone else. Joseph threatens to fire David's loaded pistol at him, claiming that his father would not die. David denies this but talks him out of the deed by threatening to move to New York.
Under Elijah's influence, David develops extra-sensory perception, previously thought to be unusual insight into human behavior, with which he can glimpse immoral acts committed by people he touches.
David's faith in Elijah is shaken when he remembers an incident from his childhood in which he almost drowned. However, Elijah suggests that the incident highlights his one weakness, water. David examines the wreckage of the train crash that he survived. David has a flashback of the car accident that ended his athletics career, and remembers that he was unharmed and that he ripped a door off the car in order to save Audrey, a memory he had long repressed. David used the accident as an excuse to quit football, because Audrey hated the sport and did not want him to play. At Elijah's suggestion, David walks through a crowd in a Philadelphia train station and senses crimes perpetrated by strangers who brush past him: a jewel robbery, a racist hate crime, and a rape. The worst offender is a sadistic janitor holding a family hostage and torturing them inside their home. On a rainy night, David follows the janitor to the victims' house. He frees the children, but is ambushed by the janitor who throws him off a balcony into a swimming pool. David nearly drowns but is rescued by the children. He grapples with the janitor, ultimately strangling him. That night, he is reconciled with Audrey. The following morning, he secretly shows the newspaper article of his anonymous heroic act to his son.
David attends an exhibition at Elijah's comic book art gallery and meets Elijah's mother (Charlayne Woodard). After talking with Elijah in the back room of his studio, David shakes his hand and receives visions indicating that Elijah orchestrated many of the fatal disasters he had mentioned including David's train accident, causing hundreds of deaths. Elijah insists the deaths were justified as a means to find David. He explains that his purpose in life is to be the archvillain to David's hero.
A screen caption reveals that David exposed Elijah to the police. Elijah was convicted of engineering the disasters and committed to an institution for the criminally insane.","supernatural power,super strength,car crash,mr.glass,psychopath,art exhibition,one of us has made a gross error,mutant,clairvoyant,destiny,villain,i'll just shoot him once,bleak,good versus evil,comic book shop,swimming pool,arch villain,train crash,bruce lee,injury,philadelphia pennsylvania,no shooting friends,osteogenesis imperfecta,train,ghetto,soothsayer,protection,mind bending,physical therapy,hostage,security guard,teletubbies,not a scratch,comic book,invulnerability,pennsylvania,sixth sense,art dealer,car accident,disability,water,you don't have a scratch on you,former football player,hero,genetic abnormality,survivor,brittle bones,flashback,superhero,arch-villain,jacking off ,murder,karate,scratch,terrorism,hallucination,comic book art,comic book,blockbuster,sole survivor,glass,birth defect,archenemy,contemplative,weightlifting,crime fighter,hero against will,bullets will bounce,shoplifter,atmospheric,art gallery,origin of hero,gloomy",3642.jpg,2000-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/unbreakable/id261327583?uo=4,d-bEPzyzNgg,60002319,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Unbreakable/60002319,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

","In the year 1202 A.D., an army led by three vampire elders (Marcus, Viktor, and Amelia) arrives at a Lycan ravaged village. After killing several werewolves, Viktor and Amelia capture their target: Marcus's brother, William Corvinus, the first and most powerful werewolf. Despite Marcus's defiance, Viktor orders that William be imprisoned in a secret location forever.
In the present day (just after the events of the first film), Selene takes Michael to a safe house so that she can return to the mansion to confront Kraven. She knows Kraven intends to kill Marcus and plans to stop him. However, Singe's blood has already awakened Marcus before Kraven arrives. Marcus wipes out Kraven and his men, and destroys the mansion. Lorenz Macaro, an elderly and imposing man, sends in a team of ""cleaners"" to investigate the aftermath from the battle in the Lycans' lair. When Macaro examines Viktor's body he finds a metal disk inside his ribcage which is the match to Sonja's pendant. The other half of the pendant is in the possession of Selene and Michael.
Marcus learns of Selene and Michael's location from camera surveillance of various safe houses and leaves to track them down. He attacks Selene and Michael, who evade him and hide in a warehouse. While inside, Selene and Michael share their feelings and have intercourse. Now knowing that the pendant is of some importance to Marcus, Michael and Selene set out to solve its mystery. Selene recalls that she'd seen it as a child, but doesn't know its significance. To find answers, they travel to the hideout of the exiled vampire historian, Andreas Tanis. Selene and Michael confront Tanis, who reveals that Marcus, not Viktor, was the first vampire; one of the three sons of Alexander Corvinus, the first immortal. Marcus was bitten by a bat and became a vampire; his twin brother, William, was bitten by a wolf and became a werewolf. The third son remained human his entire life and gave rise to a line of descendants including Michael, who became the first Lycan-Vampire Hybrid. The first werewolves created by William were entirely animal and unable to take human form again. Due to William's destructiveness, Marcus approached Viktor, a warlord dying of old age, and offered to turn him and his army into immortal vampires in exchange for tracking down and stopping William, and in destroying those he had infected.
Marcus intended to capture his brother and tame him, but Viktor ordered that William be locked away forever, far away from Marcus. Viktor did not kill the brothers because he believed that doing so would result in the immediate extinction of all other vampires and his Lycan slaves (a deception he had been fed by Marcus). Tanis also reveals that Selene's father was the architect who built William's prison and that the pendant is a key. After Lucian's escape, Viktor killed Selene's family as they knew of the prison's location, but turned Selene into a vampire. Tanis then refers Selene and Michael to Lorenz Macaro for help. Shortly after they leave, Marcus arrives and questions Tanis, who lies desperately and tries to evade telling Marcus he told Selene the family secrets. Tired of hearing Tanis' lies, Marcus learns the truth by drinking his blood, leaving Tanis dead.
Selene and Michael go to see Lorenz Macaro, who is actually Alexander Corvinus. Alexander reveals that he has devoted his life to containing the Vampire-Lycan War from the mortal world, however, he refuses to help kill his sons. When Marcus arrives, he impales Michael on a small pole and learns the location of William's hidden prison by drinking Selene's blood. He then attacks and mortally wounds his father and obtains the other half of the pendant, after deriding his father's refusal to help William and revealing he and William intend to rule the world as god-like masters of a race of hybrids. On Alexander's bidding, Selene drinks his blood, enhancing her physical strength and healing abilities to a level equivalent to that of a Hybrid such as Michael and Marcus themselves.[citation needed] When Selene asked what she would become, Alexander simply stated ""the future"". Afterwards, Alexander blows up his ship, killing himself.
Selene, aboard Corvinus' helicopter, leads the cleaners to the prison to confront and destroy Marcus, but he has already freed William. A battle ensues in which William bites the cleaners and begins turning them into werewolves. Michael, presumed to be dead inside his body-bag aboard the helicopter, suddenly regenerates and joins the fight in his Hybrid form. He ultimately kills William by tearing his head apart. Selene is then stabbed in the abdomen by Marcus, but it doesn't kill her and she pushes him into the crashed helicopter's spinning blades, killing him. After the battle, Selene suddenly notices that her hand is fully bathed in sunlight coming from the roof above, and she remains unharmed. Selene narrates that she fears the days ahead, as the death of the Elders will cause nothing but chaos, but she is nevertheless hopeful.","scary,suspenseful,stylized",3182.jpg,2006-01-19, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/underworld-evolution/id270673699?uo=4,7jHxESgl9qA,70042678,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Underworld_Evolution/70042678,"Action & Adventure,Horror,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

","Connie Sumner (Lane) and Edward Sumner (Gere) are a couple who live in suburban New York City. Their marriage is solid and loving but lacking passion. One day, Connie journeys into the city, where she is caught in a windstorm. As she seeks a taxi, she bumps into a stranger (Martinez). They both fall and Connie scrapes her knees. The stranger offers to let her use his apartment to clean up. The stranger introduces himself as Paul Martel, a Frenchman who buys and sells used books. When Martel makes small advances toward her, Connie becomes uncomfortable and decides to leave. He lets her go but gives her a book of Persian poetry, Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam as a gift.
Later that night, Connie mentions the incident to her husband. The next morning, she visits Paul's apartment where they share coffee and discuss literature, but she gets scared and leaves when he tries to engage her physically. Unable to stop thinking of Paul, she returns to his place a third time and, after some initial hesitance on her part, they have sex.
Connie and Paul begin a passionate sexual affair. Edward soon suspects something when his wife increases the frequency of her visits to Manhattan. She uses her work on a charity event as an excuse, but Edward finds holes in her stories when he speaks with mutual friends. Eventually, one of Edward's business partners catches a glimpse of Connie and Paul fawning over each other in a cafe and tells Edward, who hires a detective (Chianese) to follow Connie. The detective returns with pictures of Connie and Paul, which devastates Edward.
Connie sees Paul with another woman and attacks him, but he denies that the woman is special. She is enraged and they begin to fight in his building, but their anger turns into passion. Edward decides to visit Paul's apartment but leaves when unable to enter, and misses seeing Connie leave. He returns moments later, gets in and confronts Paul. Already upset, he is stunned to see a snow globe there, which he recognizes as his own gift to Connie. Paul says that Connie bought it for him as a gift, and Edward hits the other man with the globe and kills him. Edward cleans up the blood, wipes away his fingerprints and wraps Paul's body in a rug. As he works, the phone rings, and Edward hears Connie leaving a message that she must end the affair. Edward erases the message and leaves, putting the body in his car's trunk. Later that night, he drops it off at a dump.
Two police detectives arrive at the Sumner home. They explain that Paul's wife had reported him missing and they had found Connie's phone number in his apartment. She claims to have met him only once. A week later, the detectives return and tell Connie that they found Paul's body. She becomes upset while repeating her earlier story; Edward backs her up and adds that he never met Paul.

The four then leave for Newark International Airport. At the airport, the crew and passengers board United Airlines Flight 93. Shortly after boarding, and the safety briefing, Flight 93 is delayed for 41 minutes because of the high volume of traffic. The three other soon to be hijacked flights, American Airlines Flight 11, United Airlines Flight 175, and American Airlines Flight 77 take off at other airports.
Air traffic controllers monitoring all current flights determine that American Airlines Flight 11, a Boeing 767 from Boston's Logan International Airport has taken a turn toward New York City. Shortly after, Flight 11 crashes into the North Tower of the World Trade Center, although the air traffic controllers do not immediately realize what has happened. About 20 minutes earlier, a tape recording was made of Mohamed Atta's line ""We have some planes, just stay quiet and you'll be okay. We are returning to the airport.""
Meanwhile, United Airlines Flight 175, another Boeing 767, also from Boston, is also hijacked, and begins to descend and turn toward New York City as well. Air traffic controllers then realize they are dealing with multiple hijackings. American Airlines Flight 77, a Boeing 757 is also hijacked. The air traffic controllers and Air Force watch as Flight 175 crashes into the South Tower of the World Trade Center on live television, reported by CNN.
United Airlines Flight 93 reaches its cruising altitude about the same time that Flight 175 crashes. The pilots of Flight 93 receive a message, Beware cockpit intrusion. Two a/c hit WTC. The terrorists on Flight 93 argue about when to begin their operation. At 9:28 AM, after Ahmed al-Haznawi assembles a fake bomb, the other three hijackers wrestle their way into the cockpit, holding off the flight attendants, herding the passengers to the back of the plane, and then killing the pilots Jason Dahl, and LeRoy Homer, Jr.. The hijacker Ziad Jarrah tries to tell the passengers to Keep remaining sitting, we have a bomb on board. So sit. He accidentally transmits this and another message to Cleveland Air Traffic Control, which he realises later, turning off Flight 93's transponder.
Flight 93 turns towards D.C. while Ben Sliney ultimately decides to shut down all airspace in the United States and ground every flight. By this time, Flight 77 has crashed into the Pentagon.
The passengers on Flight 93 begin making phone calls to family through the on-board GTE Airfone system. After hearing that planes have crashed into the WTC and the Pentagon, they realize that if they do nothing they will also die, and eventually elect to storm the cockpit and retake the plane using whatever makeshift weapons they can. They wait for the right moment, as the hijackers eventually realise the passengers are thinking of taking back the plane. One of the hijackers asks Jarrah how much time they may have left, and he says 20 minutes. The hijacker responds with We don't have twenty minutes! This turns out to be all but false, as the passengers begin the revolt.
After Haznawi is beaten down and killed, Ahmed al-Nami warns Ziad Jarrah and Saeed al-Ghamdi in the cockpit of the passenger's revolt, and attempts to hold off the advancing passengers with a food cart, pepper spray, and a fire extinguisher; he too is soon overwhelmed and is killed by having his neck snapped.
Ziad Jarrah shakes the plane violently but the passengers manage to enter the cockpit; however, as they attempt to gain control, the plane plummets into an upside down nosedive. Passengers are heard screaming, wind is heard, and hands are seen grappling for the yoke. The film ends as the plane nears the ground, and the screen blacks out as the plane hits the ground.","brave,real life tragedy,overcome,suicide,september 11 2001,selfless,arab,flight,sacrifice,air traffic controller,brawl,bomb,bleak,disturbing,what happened to epilogue,stabbing,flight attendant,mass murder,aviation,cleveland ohio,virginia,muslim,cockpit,team,rough,hostage,united airlines flight 93,new york city,world trade center manhattan new york city,year 2001,prayer,doomed,new jersey,never again,manhattan new york city,critically acclaimed,one day,death,hijacker,airplane,hijack,real life event,passenger,captivating,airplane crash,sacrifice,controversy,airplane accident,self sacrifice,fire extinguisher,air traffic control,military,murder,suicide mission,terrorism,tragic ending,sincere,tense,hotel,airplane hijack,tragic event,911,violence,boston massachusetts,extremism,airport,suspenseful,hijacking,terrorist,tragedy",2384.jpg,2006-04-28, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/united-93/id361977050?uo=4,Cz9BTKO_plI,70048592,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/United_93/70048592,"Action & Adventure,Drama"

2085,Uprising,"Based upon the true story of the ""Warsaw Ghetto Uprising"" in 1943, this heart wrenching docudrama was nominated for 4 Emmy awards and 1 Golden Globe award. Following their invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Nazis force the Jewish population in Warsaw to relocate to an enclosed area that became known as the ""Warsaw Ghetto."" After years of Nazi oppression, a small resistance movement rises up and strikes back, eventually holding at bay thousands of German troops for seven months with homemade weapons and their bare hands. Starring Emmy and Golden Globe-winner Donald Sutherland (""Space Cowboys,"" ""Art of War""), Academy Award-winner Jon Voight (""Ali,"" ""Pearl Harbor""), Emmy-nominee David Schwimmer (TV's ""Friends,"" ""Band of Brothers""), Emmy-winner Hank Azaria (""America's Sweethearts,"" TV's ""Fail Safe""), Leelee Sobieski (""Joyride,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut"") and Cary Elwes (""Kiss the Girls,"" ""Twister""). Directed by Jon Avnet (""Up Close & Personal,"" ""Fried Green Tomatoes"").","Jews rise up in the Warsaw Ghetto against the Nazis in 1943.
Using radically refashioned archival footage of the Warsaw ghetto, this interview with Jon Avnet the director of Uprising talks about Marek Edelman who is an evocative memoir of his role in the rebellion that held back the Nazis for almost a month in 1943. The film begins with the growing list of prohibitions and regulations leading to the virtual imprisonment of about half-a-million Polish Jews in an old slum district of Warsaw with inadequate space and plumbing. An overhead tracking shot shows the number of people assembled in the first months of the relocation. The daily struggle against hunger and disease, especially among the dispossessed arrivals seen in their pitful rags, is aggravated by the German demands for ""deportations to the east"" that many begin to suspect are camouflaged mass murders. By the close of 1942, people living in the ghetto realize they are doomed, and the rudiments of resistance are planned by a handful of the young, including Edelman. Following some sporadic, spontaneous fighting at the ghetto railhead, the Umschlagplatz, in January, led by Moredecai Anielewicz, the scene is set for the more famous and prolonged battle that will begin on 19 April 1943. In the intervening time, many of the ghetto residents construct hidden shelters or bunkers in the basements and cellars of the buildings, often with tunnels leading to other buildings. The handful of fighters who have weapons take to these shelters, giving the uprising the advantage of defensive positions.

7155,Upside Down,"Adam and Eden fell in love as teens despite the fact that they live on twinned worlds with gravities that pull in opposite directions. Ten years after a forced separation, Adam sets out on a dangerous quest to reconnect with his love. Adam is a seemingly ordinary guy in a very extraordinary universe. He lives humbly trying to make ends meet, but his romantic spirit holds on to the memory of a girl he loved once upon a time from another world, an inverted affluent world with its own gravity, directly above but beyond reach... a girl named Eden. Their childhood flirtation becomes an impossible love. But when he catches a glimpse of grownup Eden on television, nothing will get in the way of getting her back... Not even the law or science!

Kirsten Dunst, Jim Sturgess, James Kidnie","The film starts with Adam telling the story of his planet, unique from other planets as it is the only one that has dual gravity. Two planets live next to one another. The gravity has 3 rules:
All matter is pulled by the gravity of the world that it comes from, and not the other.
An object's weight can be offset by matter from the opposite world (inverse matter).
After some time in contact, matter in contact with inverse matter burns.
The two worlds are separated. While Up is rich and prosperous, Down is poor. Up buys cheap oil from Down and sells electricity back to Down at much higher prices. Going Up is strictly forbidden and the only connection between the worlds is through the company ""TransWorld"".
Adam lives in an orphanage Down Below as he lost his parents in an oil refinery explosion. The only living relative he has is his great-aunt, whom he visits every week. His great-aunt has a secret recipe for flying pancakes using pollen from pink bees. The recipe has passed through generations and will be inherited by Adam.
As a child, Adam secretly climbs a mountain that gets very close to the Up world. There he meets Eden, a girl in Up. Years later, they are now friends as teenagers and are in a romantic relationship. They meet on their mountains and Adam uses a rope to pull Eden towards Down. As Eden sits on Adam's shoulders, they form an anti-gravity object that easily floats. But they are found and while Adam is trying to pass Eden back to her planet, he gets shot and drops her. He thinks she is dead. When he returns home, his aunt is arrested and her home burned.
Ten years later, Adam is now working on creating anti-gravity using his great-aunt's recipe. The recipe allows matter to feel both gravitational fields at once. Adam is developing it as a cosmetic product for face-lifts. Then he sees Eden on TV and learns she is alive and works at TransWorld. He finally works out his formula and gets hired by TransWorld to develop the face-lift cream. Adam's plan is to find Eden in TransWorld. In his office he meets Bob, a TransWorld employee from Up who makes a deal with him. In return of Adam bringing material (like stamps) from Down, he will help him find Eden.
With the help of Bob, Adam meets Eden by putting Up-material in his clothes to disguise himself as a worker from Up. But Eden doesn't recognize him as she lost her memories with the impact of the fall years before. The Up-material in Adam's clothes starts to burn so he has to return to Down. Later on, Bob is forcefully retired but as he leaves, he secretly gives Adam his ID to help him. Later, by calling Eden through Bob's phone, Adam manages to get a date. He presents himself as Bob.
Meanwhile, his cosmetic cream becomes of great importance to the company. While Adam is doing a presentation of the cream, Eden sees him and learns his real name. Adam runs to find her but Bob's ID has been terminated so he is noticed. He goes to Bob's house. He shows him that by mixing the matter from both gravity areas can make matter that resists both gravitational fields and tells him he didn't give TransWorld the secret ingredient of his compound, leaving the company unable to produce the product without him.
With Bob's help, he goes back to the restaurant where he met with Eden before and finds out she started to remember him. But the cops come and he has to run. When he returns to his planet, he goes to the mountain top where he met Eden. Eden comes to find him and they meet as they used to. But cops find them again and as they fail to escape, Eden is arrested by cops while Adam drops. TransWorld agrees to drop the charges against Eden if Adam gives them his formula and never contacts Eden again.
Now Adam has gone back to his old life, believing he will never see Eden again. Eden goes to Bob for help. Bob finds Adam and surprises him by showing he can stay Down without the help of the weight supplements; Bob has been able to use Adam's methods to create a way to negate the effect of gravity. Bob tells him he had the patent of his beauty cream before TransWorld and tells him he has a date.
At the spot Bob tells him, Adam finds Eden, also able to walk without weights. There, he learns that she is pregnant with twins and that is what keeps her Down.
The film ends by Adam telling their act has changed their worlds forever.",,7155.jpg,2013-03-15,,dkYvYGR7Ys4,,,"Romance,Science Fiction & Fantasy,Drama"

1328,V for Vendetta,"In an alternate future where Germany won World War II and Great Britain is now a fascist state, a masked vigilante known only as ""V"" conducts guerrilla warfare against the oppressive British government. When ""V"" rescues a young woman from the secret police, he finds in her an ally with whom he can continue his fight to free the people of Britain. Starring Academy Award-nominees and Golden Globe-winners Natalie Portman (""Closer,"" ""Star Wars"" episodes 1-3) and John Hurt (""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,"" ""Hellboy""), Academy Award and Golden Globe-nominee Stephen Rea (""Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles,"" ""The Crying Game"") and Hugo Weaving (""The Matrix"" and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy). Written and produced by the Wachowski brothers, creators of ""The Matrix"" trilogy.","In the 2030s, the world is in turmoil and warfare, while the United Kingdom remains stable under the fascist regime of the Norsefire party. Political prisoners, homosexuals and other undesirables are imprisoned in concentration camps. Evey Hammond, a woman who works at the state-run British Television Network, is rescued from an attempted rape by members of the ""Fingermen"" secret police by a Guy Fawkes-masked vigilante known as ""V"". He leads her to a rooftop to watch his destruction of the Old Bailey. Norsefire explains away the incident as an ""emergency demolition"" of a structurally unsound building, but V takes over the television broadcasts to claim responsibility. He urges the people of Britain to rise up against their government and meet him in one year, on November 5, outside the Houses of Parliament, which he promises to destroy. Evey helps V to escape, but is knocked out in the process.
V brings Evey back to his lair, the Shadow Gallery, where she is told she must stay in hiding until the fifth of November the following year for her safety. After learning that V is killing government officials, she escapes to the home of her boss, comedian and talk show host Gordon Deitrich. In return for Evey's trusting him with her safety, Deitrich reveals to her a collection of prohibited materials such as subversive paintings, an antique Quran, and homoerotic photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Deitrich explains that he has to conceal his sexuality to retain his television career. Deitrich does an over-the-top satire of the government on his television show and his home is subsequently raided, with both he and Evey captured. She is incarcerated and tortured for days for information about V, with her only solace in the notes written by another prisoner, an actress named Valerie Page, who was arrested for being a lesbian.
Evey is told that she will be executed unless she reveals V's location. An exhausted but defiant Evey says she would rather die, at which point it is revealed that her imprisonment and torture were staged by V as an exercise to free her from her fears. The notes are real, having been passed by Valerie to V years earlier when he was similarly imprisoned. Although Evey initially hates V for what he did to her, she realizes she is a stronger person. She leaves him with a promise to return before November 5.
Inspector Finch, Scotland Yard's chief of police, searches for the true identity of V, eventually tracing him back to a bioweapons program at a detention center for ""social deviants"" and political dissidents in Larkhill. Finch eventually realizes that the program, directed by then-under secretary Adam Sutler, resulted in the creation of the ""St. Mary's Virus"" and its release in a false flag terrorist attack. The deaths of 80,000 people and the resulting fear allowed the Norsefire party to win the next election, thereafter silencing all opposition and turning the United Kingdom into a totalitarian state.
As November 5 nears, V's distribution of thousands of Guy Fawkes masks begins causing chaos in the UK and the population starts questioning Norsefire's rule. On the eve of the 5th, Evey visits V, who shows her an explosive-laden train in the abandoned London Underground set to destroy Parliament. He leaves it up to Evey to decide whether to use it, believing that he is unfit to decide. V leaves to meet secret police chief Creedy, who made a deal with V to hand over Sutler in exchange for V's surrender. Although Creedy executes Sutler as V watches, V refuses to surrender and is shot by Creedy's bodyguards. V survives, partially because of his concealed armour, and kills Creedy and his men. Mortally wounded, V returns to Evey to thank her and admits he is in love with her before dying in her arms.
As Evey places V's body aboard the train, she is found by Finch. Having learned much about the corruption of the Norsefire regime, Finch allows Evey to send the train on its way. Thousands of Londoners, all wearing the Guy Fawkes masks and unarmed, march on Parliament to watch the event. Because Sutler and Creedy are dead, the military stands down in the face of a civil rebellion. Accompanied by the 1812 Overture, Parliament and Big Ben are destroyed as Evey and Finch look on. Finch asks Evey for the identity of V, to which she replies, ""He was all of us.""",,1328.jpg,2006-02-13, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/v-for-vendetta/id284441731?uo=4,,,,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

","By definition, cinema implants experiences in the minds of its viewers, so it follows that movies about characters burrowing into the subconscious of unwitting subjects naturally fit the medium. From ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" to ""Inception,"" contemporary movies have embraced this loopy fantasy by illustrating the improbable journey in exciting, magical terms. ""Vanishing Waves,"" the sophomore feature from Lithuanian director Kristina Buozyte, takes the opposite tact, depicting a tragic story of impossible love by hitting dark, elegiac notes without negating the inherent trippiness of the scenario. Both disturbingly surreal and hauntingly beautiful, ""Vanishing Waves"" finds that the human psyche is a severely haunted house.

Then again, the mind in question is significantly more haunted than most. While the doe-eyed Aurora (Jura Jutaie) lies dormant in a coma in the wake of a debilitating auto accident, a group of enigmatic scientists cluster around her, attempting to inject their conscious subject Lukas (Marius Jampolskis) into her mind by attaching diodes to his head and dunking him into a damp sensory deprivation chamber. As the scientists scrutinize 3D models on old-fashioned computer monitors, ""Vanishing Waves"" takes the focus off the precise meaning of their study and instead foregrounds the impact it has on the unsuspecting Lukas.
READ MORE: 'Vanishing Waves' and 'Here Comes the Devil' Rule the Winners Cirlce at Fantastic Fest

Unlike the slow-burn experimentation found under similar circumstances in ""Altered States,"" the scenario in ""Vanishing Waves"" yields instant success, and a startled Lukas finds himself not only literally gazing into Aurora's mind's eye but cavorting with her in the nude and quickly falling for her erotic appeal. Each bonding session with Aurora ends with a rude awakening, as Lukas is pulled out of his dream state and peppered with questions from the doctors around him. Both startled and aware that he may have crossed a vaguely defined ethical boundary, Lukas keeps the details of his missions into Aurora's mind a secret -- but we take the trip with him each time.

Little else happens in ""Vanishing Waves,"" but Lukas' real life love affair suffers from the strain of his bizarre newfound attraction and as the researchers grow dubious about his motives, the stakes inch higher. In favor of prolonged exposition, ""Vanishing Waves"" frequently turns to a series of increasingly disorienting sequences depicting Lukas' encounters with Aurora. Although they exchange few words, their bond develops a profound dimension that Buozyte depicts with swirling camerawork and shadowy, inexplicable moments that take on an ominous edge as Lukas gets closer to Aurora's emotional core.

While he locks lips with her from their first encounter, as he gets further invested in her past, he discovers its creepier mysteries, at one point stumbling into a seething mass of nude bodies and getting trapped in a claustrophobic orgy of her own making. Although Lukas makes feeble attempts to fully comprehend the everything he sees, he knows that he has started to care and worry about her disturbed state. Jampolskis' nuanced performance draws out Lukas' increasing shift from confused lab rat to committed lover eager to rescue his damsel in distress from the specter of death.

Oscillating between the austere laboratory setting and the murky palette of Aurora's mind, ""Vanishing Waves"" threatens to bludgeon its dreary scenario into a lifeless state by way of redundancies. But with their joint commitment rendered in expressionistic terms, Lukas' investment in his attempts to save Aurora from certain death take root in a consistent stream of feelings rendered with poetic imagery. Constantly drawn to his dream life with Aurora, Lukas wanders through each scene in a dazed state, and we're stuck their with him. Rarely does a final credits sequence arrive like such a harsh wakeup call.",,7156.jpg,2013-03-15,,yk-bLCJz2KA,70261753,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Vanishing_Waves/70261753,"Science Fiction & Fantasy,Romance"

44,Venus,"Life for a pair of veteran actors gets turned upside down after they meet a brash teenager.
Maurice Russell, once a great actor, is now living in London in the twilight of his life. Those of his generation remember him fondly, while those in the younger generations have no idea who he is. He spends most of his time hanging out with his friends Ian, also an actor, and Donald, or visiting with his wife Valerie for who he has great affection but with who he no longer lives. His acting career is virtually over, he only taking roles on the odd occasion when he needs the money. Ian has decided to invite his young great-niece Jessie from the provinces to come and stay with him, basically to act as his caregiver in case he falls ill, but also to be his companion. He envisions listening to Bach with her and her cooking him food to which he is accustomed. Jessie's stay is nothing as he envisions. She doesn't know how to cook, she drinks all his alcohol, and she has unrealistic visions of what she will accomplish in her life. Maurice, however, sees in Jessie, a person who can help him recapture part of his youth and vigor, including more fully realizing his thoughts of sex. Maurice calls her Venus, after one of his favorite paintings. As Maurice and Jessie spend more time together, they use each other to get what they want. But it isn't until Maurice approaches the end of his life will either understand if what they have is true friendship.

","The plot concerns Maurice (Peter O'Toole), an elderly actor who finds himself increasingly attracted to his friend Ian's great-niece Jessie (Jodie Whittaker) while simultaneously finding himself in deteriorating health due to prostate cancer. Maurice's friend describes the great-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London, England to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego Vel‚àö¬∞zquez.
Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as ""yodelling"") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname ""Venus"". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have.
The plot comes to a head when Jessie becomes involved with a boy. The two young lovers convince Maurice to take a walk so that they can have sex. Maurice initially obliges the request, but returns to kick them out of his flat. A scuffle ensues and Jessie knocks down Maurice, injuring him. Jessie leaves with the boy and apparently spends the night out partying with him at clubs, later returning to check on Maurice. When the paramedics arrive, Maurice claims he cannot remember who attacked him, much to Jessie's surprise. Then Maurice calls for ""Venus"" to take care of him.

","Vera Drake (Imelda Staunton) is devoted to her family, looking after her husband and children, her elderly mother, and a sick neighbour. Her shy daughter, Ethel (Alex Kelly), works in a lightbulb factory, and son, Sid (Daniel Mays), tailors men's suits. Her husband, Stanley (Phil Davis), is a car mechanic. Although Vera and her family are poor, their strong family bonds hold them together, and we see Vera's constant small acts of kindness to the many people she encounters throughout her day. Vera works as a house cleaner. However, unbeknownst to her family, she also serves as a backroom abortionist. She receives no money for this, believing her help to be an act of charity. However, Lily (Ruth Sheen), who also carries on a black-market trade in scarce postwar foodstuffs, charges two guineas (two pounds and two shillings: equivalent to ¬¨¬£48 in 2005) for arranging the abortions, without Vera's knowledge.
The film also contains a subplot about an upper class young woman, Susan (Sally Hawkins), the daughter of one of Vera's employers. Susan is raped by a suitor, becomes pregnant, and asks a friend to put her in contact with a doctor, through whom she can obtain an abortion. The doctor first refers her to a psychiatrist, who prompts her to answer questions in a certain way, so that he can recommend an abortion on legal grounds: that she has a family history of mental illness and that she may commit suicide if not allowed to terminate the pregnancy. The abortion costs her a hundred guineas.
After one of her patients nearly dies, Vera is arrested by the police and taken into custody for questioning. She is held overnight and appears before a magistrate the next morning. Sid is shocked by his mother's secret activities and tells his father that he does not think that he can forgive her.
Vera is bailed to appear at the Old Bailey. None of Vera's employers will give her a character reference. Her solicitor thinks she will receive the minimum sentence of 18 months in jail; the judge sentences her to two and a half years imprisonment 'as a deterrent to others'. This affects all the people who previously depended on Vera's kindness.","thought provoking,bleak,sincere,captivating,contemplative,gloomy",2014.jpg,2004-10-22, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/vera-drake/id389126324?uo=4,_5L3hGxHumY,70011194,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Vera_Drake/70011194,Drama
307,Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"Two girlfriends on a summer holiday in Spain become enamored with the same painter, unaware that his ex-wife, with whom he has a tempestuous relationship, is about to re-enter the picture.
Sexually adventurous Cristina and her friend Vicky, who is bright but cautious, holiday in Barcelona where they meet the celebrated and wholly seductive painter, Juan Antonio. Vicky is not about to dive into a sexual adventure being committed to her forthcoming marriage. But Cristina is immediately captivated by Juan Antonio's free spirit and his romantic allure is enhanced when she hears the delicious details of his divorce from fellow artist, the tempestuous Maria Elena.

 Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, Javier Bardem
","Vicky (Rebecca Hall) and Cristina (Scarlett Johansson) visit Barcelona for the summer, staying with Vicky's distant relative Judy (Patricia Clarkson) and her husband, Mark Nash (Kevin Dunn). A narrator (Christopher Evan Welch), present throughout the film, describes the two friends: Vicky is practical and traditional in her approach to love and commitment and is engaged to the reliable Doug (Chris Messina). She is in Barcelona getting her masters in ""Catalan identity."" Cristina, on the other hand, imagines herself to be a nonconformist, spontaneous but unsure of what she wants from life or love.
At an art exhibition, they catch a glimpse of the artist Juan Antonio Gonzalo (Javier Bardem). Cristina is intrigued by him at first sight, and grows curious when Judy and Mark tell the women that the artist has suffered a violent relationship with his ex-wife. Later that night, the women notice him across the room in a restaurant. He approaches their table to invite them to join him for the weekend in the city of Oviedo, in a small plane he flies himself, for sight-seeing, drinking wine, and sex. Cristina accepts the offer almost at once, but Vicky is unimpressed by his brazenness. She eventually decides to accompany her friend anyway, mainly to keep an eye on her and make sure that she doesn't get into trouble.
At the end of their first day, Juan Antonio asks both women to come to his room. Vicky refuses, but Cristina agrees, though she falls ill before anything happens. For the remainder of the weekend, Vicky and Juan Antonio are together while Cristina recuperates. During their trip, he tells her about his former wife and muse, Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena, and their tumultuous relationship. Vicky's opinion of Juan Antonio begins to change when he takes her to visit his father, an old poet. Late at night, they attend a Spanish guitar concert. Afterwards, Vicky finally succumbs to his advances on the way back home.
The next day, Juan takes them back to Barcelona. Vicky, feeling guilty, does not mention the incident to Cristina, and the two begin to grow apart, Vicky throwing herself into her Catalan culture studies and Cristina taking up photography. Cristina quickly moves in with Juan Antonio. Meanwhile, Doug unexpectedly telephones Vicky, suggesting that they get married in Spain. She reluctantly agrees and he flies to meet her.
One night, Cristina and Juan Antonio are awakened by a call, learning that Juan's ex-wife Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena (Pen‚àö¬©lope Cruz) has attempted to kill herself. Juan Antonio brings her to his house, and she moves into the guest room. Though initially Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena mistrusts Cristina, she soon grows fond of her and her photography.
Cristina soon realizes that the ex-spouses are still in love, and Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena confides that their relationship was always loving but unstable because they were missing something, a mystery element. Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena suggests that the missing link is, in fact, Cristina and the three become polyamorous. Cristina discloses the events of her life to Vicky, who appears secretly jealous of her friend's relationship with Juan Antonio, and to Doug, who disapproves.
As the summer winds to a close, Vicky realizes she is unsatisfied in her married life and is still attracted to Juan Antonio. She learns that Judy is also unhappy in her marriage and confides in the older woman. Judy, who sees Vicky as a younger version of herself, decides to bring Juan Antonio and Vicky together. Vicky, however, believes that Judy, through Vicky, is ""trying to rewrite"" her own history. Meanwhile, Cristina becomes restless and announces she is leaving Juan Antonio and Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena. Mar‚àö‚â†a does not take the news well and breaks down. Cristina spends the last weeks of the summer in France. With their ""missing link"" gone, Juan Antonio and Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena's relationship becomes abusive again, and Mar‚àö‚â†a descends back into insanity.
Attempting to pair up Juan Antonio and Vicky, Judy arranges for them both to be at a party. Juan Antonio begs Vicky to meet him the next day. After lying to Doug, Vicky goes to Juan's home for lunch, after which Juan tries to seduce her again. She is at the point of consenting when Mar‚àö‚â†a Elena bursts in with a gun and begins firing wildly. As Juan Antonio tries to calm his sobbing ex-wife, he accidentally shoots Vicky in the hand. Vicky shouts at both of them, saying they are insane and she could never live like this, and leaves.
When Cristina returns from France, Vicky confesses the entire story to her. Cristina says she never knew that Vicky felt that way about Juan Antonio, and she (Cristina) wishes she could have helped her. Doug never learns what truly happened. As the three Americans return home, Vicky goes back to her married life and Cristina remains where she started, knowing only what she doesn't want.","argument,sex,sentimental,cynical,more...,sadness,jealousy,threesome,trust,witty,heated,humorous,photo,captivating,less...,biting,contemplative,three,sexual,clever,tantrum,anticipation,culture",307.jpg,2008-05-17, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/vicky-cristina-barcelona/id305118879?uo=4,39PuFOTjtk8,70097585,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Vicky_Cristina_Barcelona/70097585,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"

598,Waiting for Guffman,"An aspiring director and the marginally-talented amateur cast of a hokey small-town Missouri musical production go overboard when they learn that someone from Broadway will be in attendance.
A town of Blaine, Missouri is preparing for celebrations of its 150th anniversary. Corky St.Clair, an off-off-off-off-off-Broadway director is putting together an amateur theater show about the town's history, starring a local dentist, a couple of travel agents, a Dairy Queen waitress, and a car repairman. He invites a Broadway theater critic Mr. Guffman to see the opening night of the show.

Director:
 Christopher Guest
Writers:
 Christopher Guest, Eugene Levy
Stars:
 Christopher Guest, Fred Willard, Catherine O'Hara
","The film is a parody of community theater set in the fictional small town of Blaine, Missouri. It chronicles the trials and tribulations of a handful of utterly delusional residents as they prepare to put on a community theater production led by eccentric director Corky St. Clair, played by Christopher Guest. The show, a musical chronicling the town's history, titled Red, White and Blaine, is to be performed as part of the town's 150th anniversary celebration.
Along with Guest, the film stars Catherine O'Hara and Fred Willard as Ron and Sheila Albertson, a pair of married travel agents (yet have never traveled outside of Blaine) who are also regular amateur performers, and give their companions a little too much information at a restaurant dinner; Parker Posey as the perpetual Dairy Queen employee Libby Mae Brown; Bob Balaban as Lloyd Miller, the increasingly frustrated musical director who actually possesses some talent; Lewis Arquette as Clifford Wooley, a ""long time Blaineian"" and retired taxidermist who is Red, White and Blaine's bean-loving narrator; Matt Keeslar as the handsome and oblivious mechanic Johnny Savage, who Corky goes out of his way to get into the play; and Eugene Levy as Dr. Alan Pearl, a tragically square dentist determined to discover his inner entertainer. Brian Doyle-Murray appears briefly as Savage's dad and boss who is immediately suspicious of Corky's eccentric behavior.
Corky has presumably used connections gained from his ""off-off-off-off"" Broadway past to invite Mort Guffman, a Broadway producer, to critique Red, White and Blaine. Corky leads the cast to believe that a positive review from Guffman could mean that the group can take their show all the way to Broadway.
The program itself is designed to musically retell the history of Blaine, whose founding father was a buffoon incapable of distinguishing the geography of middle Missouri and the Pacific coastline. We also learn why the town refers to itself obtusely as ""the stool capital of the United States"". The music contained within is a series of grating and poorly performed songs such as ""Nothing Ever Happens on Mars"" (a reference to the town's supposed visit by a UFO), and ""Stool Boom"". The DVD contains ""This Bulging River"" and ""Nothing Ever Happens in Blaine"", which were edited from the cinema release.
Central to the film are Corky St. Clair's stereotypically gay mannerisms. He supposedly has a wife called Bonnie, whom no-one in Blaine has ever met or seen; he uses her to explain his habit of shopping for women's clothing and shoes. When Johnny Savage is forced by his suspicious father (Brian Doyle-Murray) to quit the show, Corky takes over his roles, which were clearly intended for a young, masculine actor: a lusty young frontiersman, a heartbroken soldier, and a little boy wearing a beanie and shorts. St. Clair never sheds his dainty demeanor, bowl haircut, lisp or earring in spite of his historical roles, and his face is pasted with an overkill of stage rouge and eyeliner. Corky is also faced with creating his magic on a shoestring budget, and at one point quits the show after storming out of a meeting with the City Council, who turns down his request for $100,000 to finance the production. But the distraught cast and persuasive city fathers convince Corky to return to the show (to the disappointment of Lloyd Miller, who had taken over in Corky's absence).
At the show's performance, Guffman's seat is seen to be empty, much to the dismay of the cast; Corky assures them that Broadway producers always arrive a bit late for the show, and sure enough a man, (Paul Benedict), soon takes Guffman's reserved seat. The show is well received by the audience, and St. Clair invites the assumed Guffman backstage to talk to the actors. Upon arriving, he declares that he is not Guffman, and had come to Blaine to witness the birth of his niece's baby but enjoyed the show. Corky then reads a telegram stating that Guffman's plane was grounded by snowstorms in New York (though it is in the summer).
An epilogue shows the fates of the cast: While Libby Mae has returned yet again to the Dairy Queen, Dr. Pearl and the Albertsons have both pursued their dreams of being entertainers: Ron and Sheila travel to Hollywood to work as extras, and Dr. Pearl now entertains elderly Jews in Florida retirement communities. Corky has returned to New York, where he has opened a Hollywood-themed novelty shop, which includes such items as Brat Pack bobblehead dolls, My Dinner with Andre action figures, and The Remains of the Day lunch boxes. When Corky is showing his collection, a Charlie Weaver doll can be seen. Charlie Weaver aka Cliff Arquette was Lewis Arquette's father.",,598.jpg,1997-01-31, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/waiting-for-guffman/id372924757?uo=4,,,,Comedy
1594,Waitress,"Jenna is a pregnant, unhappily married waitress in the deep south. She meets a newcomer to her town and falls into an unlikely relationship as a last attempt at happiness.
Jenna is unhappily married, squirreling away money, and hoping to win a pie-baking contest so, with the prize money, she'll have enough cash to leave her husband Earl. She finds herself pregnant, which throws her plans awry. She bakes phenomenal pies at Joe's diner, listens to old Joe's wisdom, tolerates her sour boss Cal, is friends with Dawn and Becky (her fellow waitresses), and finds a mutual attraction with the new doctor in town. As the pregnancy advances, life with Earl seems less tolerable, a way out less clear, and the affair with the doctor complicated by his marriage. What options does a waitress have?

Director:
 Adrienne Shelly
Writer:

Stars:
 Keri Russell, Nathan Fillion, Jeremy Sisto
","Keri Russell plays Jenna, a waitress living in the American South, who is trapped in an unhappy marriage with the abusive Earl (Jeremy Sisto). She works in Joe's Pie Diner, where her job includes creating inventive pies with unusual titles inspired by her life, such as the ""Bad Baby Pie"" she invents after her unwanted pregnancy is confirmed. Jenna longs to run away from her dismal marriage, and is slowly accumulating money to do so. She pins her hopes for escape on a pie contest in a nearby town, which offers a $25,000 grand prize, but her husband won't let her go. Her only friends are coworkers Becky and Dawn (Cheryl Hines and Adrienne Shelly), and Joe (Andy Griffith), the curmudgeonly owner of the diner and several other local businesses, who encourages her to begin a new life elsewhere.
Jenna's life changes after she meets her new physician, Jim Pomatter (Nathan Fillion). He has moved to the small town to accommodate his wife, who is completing her residency at the local hospital, and is filling in for the woman who has been Jenna's doctor since childhood. The two are attracted to each other, and over the course of several pre-natal appointments the attraction grows. After Dr. Pomatter invites her into the office under a quickly exposed pretext, she impulsively initiates a passionate (and secret) affair.
Prompted by the gift of a baby journal, Jenna begins to keep a diary, ostensibly for her unborn child, with voiceovers giving the viewer access to her thoughts about that future child and her own plans. Between these entries, her relationship with Dr. Pomatter, and the thoughts she reveals as she describes the various pies she creates, the audience gets to know her evolving hopes and dreams, concerns and fears, and slowly growing attachment to the baby she at first didn't want.
After giving birth, Jenna bonds immediately with the baby girl she names Lulu. Earl, clearly disappointed it's a girl and witnessing that bonding, reminds Jenna of a promise he had forced her to make earlier not to love the baby more than she does him. That comment, the proverbial straw that broke the camel's back, wipes away any concerns she has about her lack of money and her fear of her husband. With determined frankness she tells him bluntly she hasn't loved him in years, will no longer put up with his possessiveness and abuse, and wants a divorce. Later, while Becky and Dawn are helping her prepare to leave the hospital and letting her know that Joe had collapsed and died, Jenna remembers an envelope Joe had brought to her before the birth, when she finds out he had been admitted as a patient in the same hospital. In the envelope she finds a handmade card with a sketch of her, a check for $270,450, and a message of friendship that urges her to start her life anew. While leaving the hospital, Dr. Pomatter wants to have a word with her in private regarding their affair and what is to happen now. She promptly breaks it off, handing him a chocolate Moon Pie and asks her friends to wheel her out. On the way out they ask her what that was all about, to which she coolly replies that she was having an affair with him and just ended it.
An epilogue depicts Jenna winning the pie contest, and becoming the new owner of the diner where she worked, now called Lulu's Pies, serving brightly colored pies to her customers and friends. The final shot shows her walking home hand-in-hand with the now toddler-aged Lulu (played by Shelly's actual daughter, Sophie).","humorous,sentimental,bittersweet,touching",1594.jpg,2007-01-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/waitress/id270021764?uo=4,0cQ0WwcKCLk,70062726,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Waitress/70062726,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"
1903,Waking Life,"A man shuffles through a dream meeting various people and discussing the meanings and purposes of the universe.
Dreams. What are they? An escape from reality or reality itself? Waking Life follows the dream(s) of one man and his attempt to find and discern the absolute difference between waking life and the dreamworld. While trying to figure out a way to wake up, he runs into many people on his way; some of which offer one sentence asides on life, others delving deeply into existential questions and life's mysteries. We become the main character. It becomes our dream and our questions being asked and answered. Can we control our dreams? What are they telling us about life? About death? About ourselves and where we come from and where we are going? The film does not answer all these for us. Instead, it inspires us to ask the questions and find the answers ourselves.

Director:
 Richard Linklater
Writer:
 Richard Linklater
Stars:
 Ethan Hawke, Trevor Jack Brooks, Lorelei Linklater
","Waking Life is about an unnamed[2] young man living an ethereal existence that lacks transitions between everyday events and that eventually progresses toward an existential crisis. For most of the film he observes quietly but later participates actively in philosophical discussions involving other characters‚Äö√Ñ√Æranging from quirky scholars and artists to everyday restaurant-goers and friends‚Äö√Ñ√Æabout such issues as metaphysics, free will, social philosophy, and the meaning of life. Other scenes do not even include the protagonist's presence, but rather, show an isolated person or couple speaking about such topics from a disembodied perspective. Along the way, the film touches also upon existentialism, situationist politics, posthumanity, the film theory of Andr‚àö¬© Bazin, and lucid dreaming, and makes references to various celebrated intellectual and literary figures by name.
Gradually, the protagonist begins to realize that he is living out a perpetual dream, broken up only by occasional false awakenings. So far he is mostly a passive onlooker, though this changes during a chat with a passing woman who suddenly approaches him. After she eccentrically greets and shares her creative ideas with him, he reminds himself of his recent realization and of the fact that she must, therefore, be a figment of his own dreaming imagination. Afterwards, he starts to converse more openly with other dream characters as well; however, he ultimately begins to despair about being utterly trapped in this unending, irresolvable dream-state.
The protagonist's final talk is with a character who looks somewhat similar to the protagonist himself and whom he briefly encountered previously, earlier on in the film. This last conversation reveals this other character's understanding that reality may be only a single instant that the individual interprets falsely as time (and, thus, life); that living is simply the individual's constant negation of God's invitation to become one with the universe; that dreams offer a glimpse into the infinite nature of reality; and that in order to be free from the illusion called life, the individual need only to accept God's invitation‚Äö√Ñ√Æthough he does not explicitly explain how this is achieved.
The protagonist is last seen walking into a driveway when he suddenly begins to levitate, paralleling a scene at the start of the film of a floating child in the same driveway. Unlike the child who grabbed firmly onto the handle of a nearby car, however, the protagonist uncertainly reaches toward the same handle but is too swiftly lifted above the vehicle and over the trees. He now rises into the endless blue expanse of the sky until he disappears from view altogether.","tense,contemplative,stylized,clever,atmospheric,captivating,offbeat",1903.jpg,2001-01-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/waking-life/id547156351?uo=4,uecHd_qW1es,60021932,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Waking_Life/60021932,"Animation,Art House & International,Drama,Special Interest"

","While the film begins with footage of Wal-Mart CEO Lee Scott praising the corporation at a large employee convention, the film spends a majority of its running time on personal interviews.

","In 1968, an audience of inmates at Folsom State Prison cheer for Johnny Cash's band as he waits backstage near a table saw, reminding him of his early life.
In 1944, Johnny, then known as J.R., grows up the son of a share cropper on a cotton farm in Dyess, Arkansas, and is adept with hymnals, while his brother Jack is training himself to become a pastor. While Jack is sawing wood for a neighbor, J.R. goes fishing while he finishes. However, Jack injures himself with the saw, and dies of his injuries. Cash's strained relationship with his father Ray, becomes much more difficult after Jack's death. In 1950, J.R. enlists in the United States Air Force as Johnny Cash, and is posted in West Germany. One day in 1952, he finds solace in playing a guitar he bought and writing songs‚Äö√Ñ√Æone of which will become ""Folsom Prison Blues"". Cash is eventually discharged, and marries his girlfriend Vivian Liberto. The couple move to Memphis, Tennessee, where Cash works as a door-to-door salesman to support his growing family. He walks past a recording studio, which inspires him to organize a band to play gospel music. Cash's band auditions for Sam Phillips, the owner of Sun Records. Phillips interrupts the audition and asks Cash to play a song that he really ""feels"", prompting them to play ""Folsom Prison Blues"". The band is contracted by Sun Records.
The band begins touring as Johnny Cash and the Tennessee Two. He meets many different artists on tour, including June Carter, with whom Cash soon falls in love. Cash begins spending more time with June, who divorces her first husband, Carl Smith. After an attempt by Cash to woo June backfires, he begins to take drugs and alcohol. After his behavior peaks during a performance with June, they go their separate ways. Over Vivian's objections, Johnny persuades June to come out of semi-retirement at an awards show and tour with him. The tour is a success, but backstage, Vivian is critical of June's influence. After one Las Vegas performance, Cash and June sleep together in her hotel room. The next morning, she notices Cash taking several pills and begins to doubt her choices. At that evening's concert, Cash, upset by Carter's apparent rejection, behaves erratically and eventually passes out. June disposes of Cash's drugs and begins to write ""Ring of Fire"", describing her feelings for Cash and her pain at watching him descend into addiction.
On his way home, Cash travels to Mexico to purchase more drugs and is arrested. Cash's marriage to Vivian begins to crumble and after a final violent dispute, the pair eventually divorce and Cash moves to Nashville in 1966. In an attempt to reconcile with June, Cash buys a large house near a lake in Hendersonville. His parents, and the extended Carter family, arrive for Thanksgiving, at which time Ray dismisses his son's achievements and behavior. After eating, June's mother‚Äö√Ñ√Æaware of her daughter's true feelings toward Cash‚Äö√Ñ√Æencourages her to help him. After a long detoxification period, Cash wakes up with June by his side. June says she, and God, have given Cash a second chance. Although not formally a couple, the two begin to spend most of their time with each other.
Cash discovers that most of his fan mail comes from prisoners, impressed with the outlaw image that Cash has cultivated. Cash visits his recording company he signed with in 1958, Columbia Records, and proposes that he record an album live inside Folsom Prison. Despite Columbia's doubts, Cash says that he will perform regardless and the label can use the tapes if they wish.
At the Folsom Prison concert, Cash tells how he always admired prisoners, explaining that his arrest for drug possession helped him to relate to them. The concert is a great success, and Cash embarks on a tour with June and his band.

3049,Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,"Ambitious young investment banker Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf) discovers that greed is still the name of the game when he forges a fragile alliance with onetime Wall Street hotshot Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) shortly after Gekko is released from prison. Having served eight years for securities fraud, money laundering, and racketeering, Gekko emerges from prison to find that his daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), prefers to remain estranged, and that his former Wall Street cohorts are still raking in the cash. Flash-forward to 2008, and Winnie is dating a proprietary trader named Jake Moore (LaBeouf), who expresses a passion for green energy while working for his mentor Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), of Keller Zabel Investments. Despite heading up one of the most prominent investment firms in the country, Louis Zabel is forced to personally fight for the future of Keller Zabel before the Federal Reserve after the company's stock takes a hit due to persistent rumors that it's being dragged down by debt. Denied a bailout from the government, Keller Zabel soon falls victim to a hostile takeover lead by powerful investment bank partner Bretton James (Josh Brolin), of Churchill Schwartz. His job on the line and his mentor out of the picture, Jake discovers that Gordon Gekko is out promoting his new book ""Is Greed Good?"" and decides to attend a lecture being given by the author at Fordham University. According to Gekko, greed is now sanctioned by the government, and the U.S. economy is on the verge of collapse as a direct result of leveraged debt and wild conjecture. When Jake goes behind Winnie's back to try and repair her relationship with her father, Gekko reveals his compelling theories on the likely reasons for Zabel's downfall. Later, as Jake begins plotting to avenge his mentor, Gekko starts to reveal his true colors. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","In 2001, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas) is released from prison after serving eight years for insider trading and securities fraud. Seven years later, Gekko is promoting his new book Is Greed Good?, while his estranged daughter, Winnie (Carey Mulligan), runs a small news website and is dating Jacob Moore (Shia LaBeouf), a top proprietary trader at Keller Zabel Investments (KZI). Jacob is a prot‚àö¬©g‚àö¬© of managing director Louis Zabel (Frank Langella), and is trying to raise money for a fusion research project.
After Keller Zabel's stock loses more than 30% of its value, Zabel tries to arrange a bailout for KZI from other Wall Street banks but is blocked by Bretton James (Josh Brolin), head of rival firm Churchill Schwartz, which Zabel had refused to bail out eight years earlier. The next morning Zabel kills himself by jumping in front of a subway train. Distraught, Moore proposes marriage to Winnie, who accepts. Later, he approaches Gekko after a lecture. Gekko tells Jacob that his daughter refuses to speak to him and that Keller Zabel's collapse started when rumours of the company having toxic debt started to spread. Jacob and Gekko arrange a trade: Jacob will reconcile Winnie and Gekko, while Gekko will gather information to destroy Bretton.
Aided by Gekko, Moore learns that Bretton James profited from the Keller Zabel collapse. In revenge, he spreads rumors about the nationalization of an African oil field owned by Churchill Schwartz. The company loses $120 million, and Bretton offers Moore a job, which he accepts determined to avenge Zabel. At his new job, Moore convinces Chinese investors to fund the fusion research he has been supporting. Bretton is impressed by Jacob's initiative and is also glad for the new investment.
As the economy starts to crumble, Winnie announces to Moore she is pregnant, and Bretton reveals to Moore that the Chinese investment is going into bunk solar panels and fossil fuels instead of fusion research, which upsets Moore. Gekko proposes a solution, using a $100 million trust fund account in Switzerland, which Gekko set up for Winnie in the 1980s, to fund the research and save the company. She signs the money over to Moore who then entrusts it to Gekko to legitimize the funds for investment in the fusion research company. However, the money never arrives, and Gekko leaves the country with the money. Jacob realizes that Gekko has been using him to get the money in the account for his own gain. Distraught, Jacob confesses to Winnie that he had been secretly meeting with Gekko. Winnie then asks Jacob to leave as she neither trusts him nor feels safe around him.
Moore tracks Gekko to London where he is running a hedgefund like financial company with the $100 million. Jacob proposes one last trade: Winnie gets her money back, and Gekko gets a grandson, but Gekko refuses. Moore pieces together everything from Keller Zabel's collapse to the economic bailout of Bretton's company and gives the information to Winnie telling her that revealing it will bring her website publicity and credibility. Winnie runs the story, and Bretton James is exposed. The investors leave Bretton and go to Gekko on the back of his $1.1 billion return as Bretton finds himself under intense legal scrutiny by the government. As Jacob finds Winnie in New York, Gekko appears and tells them that he deposited $100 million into the fusion research's account anonymously. He apologizes to Jacob and Winnie, who then reconcile. One year later, Gekko is seen at his grandson Louis ('Louie') first birthday party along with Jacob's mother and Jacob and Winnie's friends.","greed,gamble,risks,money talks,business world,wall street,busienss,risky,stocks,business,disgust,risk,risky business,betrayal,bullshit walks,e-commerce,lose it all,money,assess,anticipation,stock market,business model canvas,control,million,identify,trust,ecommerce,business model,makes the world go round,illion,business risk,business opportunity,surprise,employees",3049.jpg,2010-05-14, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/wall-street-money-never-sleeps/id390018656?uo=4,q7j8leLG8fc,70125930,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Wall_Street_Money_Never_Sleeps/70125930,Drama
1665,Wanted,"A frustrated office worker learns that he is the son of a professional assassin, and that he shares his father's superhuman killing abilities.
The anxious, clumsy and abused office clerk Wesley Allan Gibson has a hell and boring routine life: his obese boss humiliates him all the time and his girlfriend betrays him with his colleague and best friend during working period. When he meets the sexy Fox, Wesley is informed that his father was a professional killer that belonged to an ancient organization called Fraternity and killed by the skilled and powerful Cross, a hit-man that has betrayed the Fraternity. Wesley learns that his anxiety actually is a manifestation of his latent abilities and he joins the society under the command of Sloan. Trained by Fox, he changes his personality and attitude, being prepared to face the dangerous Cross and find a hidden secret.

","In Chicago, Wesley Gibson is an American born in Moravia, who works at a dead-end desk job with an overbearing boss, takes anti-anxiety medication for panic attacks, and has a live-in girlfriend who cheats on him with his best friend Barry.
One night in the pharmacy, Wesley is told by a mysterious woman named Fox that his father was a recently murdered assassin, and the killer, Cross, is after him. Cross and Fox engage in a shoot-out followed by a car chase in the streets of Chicago. Wesley manages to escape and Fox has a shoot-out again with Cross, causing a car accident that knocks Wesley unconscious. Fox brings Wesley to the headquarters of The Fraternity, a thousand-year-old secret society of assassins. The group's current leader, Sloan, explains that Wesley's panic attacks are actually the untrained expression of a rare superhuman ability; when stressed, the drastically increased heart rate and adrenaline levels result in bursts of superhuman strength, speed, and reflexes ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ demonstrated when he successfully shoots the wings off of three flies. The Fraternity can teach him to control this ability, so Wesley can follow in his father's footsteps as an assassin, beginning by inheriting his fortune. Wesley is initially reluctant and returns to work, only to finally snap when discovering several million dollars in his bank account. He excoriates his boss in front of the entire office, and on his way out, smashes Barry in the face with a computer keyboard. Fox is waiting outside to take him back to the Fraternity headquarters ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ an unassuming textile mill.
Wesley is then subjected to brutal training; among other forms of combat, he learns to fire bullets to curve around objects (even using Fox as a subject in front of the target). Afterward, Wesley is shown the Loom of Fate, a loom that gives the names of the targets through binary code hidden in weaving errors of the fabric. Those the Loom identifies will apparently cause tragedy in the future; but only Sloan sees and interprets the names fate wishes to see dead. Wesley is initially reluctant about killing people. Then Fox reveals that in her childhood, a hired assassin burned her father alive in front of her‚Äö√Ñ√Æand said hitman was supposed to be killed by the Fraternity before that, but the assassin failed to pull the trigger. She now considers preventing such tragedy her mission and her loyalty to the Loom of Fate and The Fraternity.
After several routine missions and a chance meeting with Cross, in which Wesley is shot in the arm with a deliberately traceable bullet, Sloan grants Wesley's wish to avenge his father and sends him after Cross‚Äö√Ñ√Æbut then secretly gives Fox a mission to kill Wesley, saying that his name had come up in the Loom as well. Analyzing the bullet that hit Wesley, it is discovered that the manufacturer was Pekwarsky, a bullet-maker living in eastern Moravia, the birthplace of the Fraternity. Wesley and Fox travel there and capture Pekwarsky, who arranges a meeting with Cross. Wesley faces Cross alone on a moving train. Fox steals a car and crashes it into the train, eventually causing a derailment. After Cross saves Wesley‚Äö√Ñ√¥s life by preventing him from falling into a ravine, Wesley fatally shoots him. Before dying, Cross reveals that he is Wesley's real father. Fox confirms this, and explains that Wesley was recruited because he was the only person that Cross would not kill. Fox then reveals the kill order on Wesley and raises her gun, but Wesley escapes by shooting out the glass underneath him and plunging into the river below with Cross's body.
Wesley is retrieved by Pekwarsky, who takes him to his father's apartment, located across the street from Wesley's old home. Pekwarsky explains that Sloan started manufacturing targets for profit after discovering that he was targeted by the Loom of Fate, and did not tell the Fraternity members that they were now nothing more than paid killers. The gang hang some of their friends in order to get to him. Cross discovered the truth and went rogue, and started killing Fraternity members to keep them away from his son. Pekwarsky departs, stating that Wesley's father wished him a life free of violence. Wesley, however, decides to take out Sloan after discovering a secret room containing all of his father's weapons and maps.
An enraged Wesley assaults the Fraternity's textile mill-fortress and battles his way through it, killing nearly every Fraternity member in the process. Upon entering Sloan's office, he reveals Sloan's deception to the master assassins present in the room. Sloan reveals that all of their names had come up in the weaving, and that he had merely acted to protect them. Were they to follow the code, every one of them should kill themselves on the spot. Fox, who believes in the code more than anyone due to her own experience, turns on her fellow assassins, and curves a bullet that kills every Fraternity member in the room, including herself, but not before she throws her gun to Wesley to distract him from trying to save her. During all this, the Loom of Fate is destroyed, and Sloan manages to escape.
Wesley, penniless once again, is left aimless. A man is then seen at a computer, much like Wesley at the beginning of the film. Sloan appears and points a gun at the back of the man's head. At that moment, the man turns around and is revealed to be a decoy. Sloan is then killed by Wesley using a long-distance bullet. Similar to the comic book miniseries,[3] the film ends with Wesley stating his accomplishments, then breaking the fourth wall by asking the audience ""What the fuck have you done lately?"".","exciting,curve,suspenseful,stylized,rough,gun slinger,gun",1665.jpg,2008-06-12, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/wanted/id286532012?uo=4,q9Mr-iYZRZk,70075479,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Wanted/70075479,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Mystery & Suspense,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

7125,Warm Bodies,"After a zombie becomes involved with the girlfriend of one of his victims, their romance sets in motion a sequence of events that might transform the entire lifeless world.

With much of the future world's population rendered into an undead horde, R is a young, and oddly introspective, zombie. On a feeding encounter with a human gathering party, R meets Julie and feels an urge to protect her. What happens with that is the beginnings of a strangely warm relationship that causes R to start to regain his humanity. As this change spreads throughout the undead population, Julie and R eventually find they are facing a larger issue even as their friendship is challenged. Caught between the paranoid human forces and the ferocious Bonie zombies who are a mutual threat, R and Julie must find a way to bridge the sides for fight for a better world no one thought possible.","After a zombie apocalypse, R, a zombie, spends his days wandering around an airport which is now filled with hordes of his fellow undead, including his best friend M. R and M achieve rudimentary communication with grunts and moans and ""Eh's"" and occasional near-words. As a zombie, R constantly craves human flesh, especially brains, as he is able to ""feel alive"" on the memories of their former owners. The zombies travel in packs, moving very slowly, searching for victims to feed on. While out looking for food, R and a pack of zombies find Julie Grigio and a group of her friends, who were sent out by Julie's father from a heavily-fortified, walled-off human enclave in a nearby city to recover medical supplies from abandoned buildings. R sees Julie and is drawn to her. After being shot in the chest by Julie's boyfriend, Perry, R kills Perry while Julie is distracted and eats his brain, giving R his thoughts and memories making his attraction to Julie become even stronger. He rescues Julie from the rest of the pack and takes her back to an airplane he lives in at the airport to keep her safe. The two bond, causing R to slowly begin to come to life.[9]
Eventually, Julie gets restless and convinces R to take her home. On the way, R reveals to her that he killed Perry, causing her to abandon R and return alone to the human enclave. R begins to make his way back to the airport, heartbroken, but when he sees that M and other zombies are also beginning to show signs of life, he and M lead a group to the human enclave, where R sneaks inside the wall. There he meets Julie's friend Nora and her father Colonel Grigio, leader of the human group. While Nora is grudgingly accepting, Colonel Grigio refuses to believe corpses can change and threatens to kill R. Julie and R escape to a baseball stadium where the rest of R's group is waiting, but find themselves under attack by a horde of skeletal zombies (also known as Boneys) who have irretrievably lost all traces of humanity, and are set on killing and eating anything with a heartbeat, which now includes R and his friends.
Julie and R run from the Boneys, finding themselves trapped. Taking the only escape route, R jumps with Julie into a pool far below, shielding her from the impact, and both of them survive the fall. Thrilled to be alive, they kiss passionately. However, Colonel Grigio shoots R in the shoulder, causing him to bleed and proving that he has become human again. The humans and zombies combine forces and kill the Boneys, and the zombies slowly assimilate into human society. The human population destroys the walls surrounding the human society after the annihilation of the Boney population, creating a life for both humans and reanimated corpses much like the days before the apocalypse. The film ends with now-human R and Julie overlooking the city. Julie tells R to rename himself, but he decides to keep his name R, content with his new life.","zombie sexuality,undead,girlfriend,redemption of the undead,flesh eating zombies,walking dead,have a heart,dystopia,zombie post apocalypse,zombies,zombie,apocalypse,eating,disgusting,dead,undead sexuality,torment,redemption",7125.jpg,2013-02-01,,07s-cNFffDM,70230639,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Warm_Bodies/70230639,
1761,Warrior,"The youngest son of an alcoholic former boxer returns home, where he's trained by his father for competition in a mixed martial arts tournament - a path that puts the fighter on a collision corner with his older brother.

Two brothers face the fight of a lifetime - and the wreckage of their broken family - within the brutal, high-stakes world of Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighting in Lionsgate's action/drama, WARRIOR. An ex-Marine haunted by a tragic past, Tommy Riordan returns to his hometown of Pittsburgh and enlists his father, a recovered alcoholic and his former coach, to train him for an MMA tournament awarding the biggest purse in the history of the sport. As Tommy blazes a violent path towards the title prize, his brother, Brendan, a former MMA fighter unable to make ends meet as a public school teacher, returns to the amateur ring to provide for his family. Even though years have passed, recriminations and past betrayals keep Brendan bitterly estranged from both Tommy and his father. But when Brendan's unlikely rise as an underdog sets him on a collision course with Tommy, the two brothers must finally confront the forces that tore them apart, all the while waging the most intense, winner-takes-all battle of their lives.

Director:
 Gavin O'Connor
Writers:
 Gavin O'Connor, Anthony Tambakis
Stars:
 Tom Hardy, Nick Nolte, Joel Edgerton
","The film opens with U.S. Marine Tommy Riordan (Tom Hardy) visiting his father, Paddy Conlon (Nick Nolte), a recovering alcoholic who has become a born-again Christian. Tommy becomes angry about his father's formerly abusive behavior and Paddy fails to convince him that he has truly changed. The next day, Tommy enters a gym where he beats a professional fighter named Pete ""Mad Dog"" Grimes (Erik Apple) unconscious in less than 30 seconds, in a fight which is filmed via a cell phone's video camera and later uploaded to the Internet, where it goes viral. Tommy learns about a winner-takes-all mixed martial arts tournament called Sparta where the winner receives $5,000,000. In order to provide for the family of his fallen friend in the Marine Corps, Tommy asks his father to help him train for the tournament, but only under the condition that Paddy does not try to reconcile their relationship.
Meanwhile, Paddy's older son, Brendan Conlon (Joel Edgerton), a high school physics teacher and former UFC fighter, is struggling to financially provide for his wife Tess (Jennifer Morrison) and two daughters and faces the possibility of his home getting foreclosed due to mortgage re-financing to pay for his younger daughter's open heart surgery. To increase his income, Brendan risks returning to his former profession as a mixed martial arts fighter battling amateur fighters for money. Rumors of Brendan fighting in the ring begin spreading amongst his students. The school's superintendent, objecting to his participation in such dangerous activities, suspends him without pay. Left with no other option, Brendan seeks the training of old friend Frank Campana (Frank Grillo) and begins competing in smaller venue fights. After the fighter Frank planned to enter into the Sparta tournament is injured during training, Brendan convinces Frank to enter him as a replacement.
After arriving at the tournament, Brendan discovers that Tommy has also entered. When the two brothers confront each other for the first time in 14 years, it is explained that Brendan chose to stay behind with his then-girlfriend Tess when he was 16 years old instead of moving away from their father with Tommy and their mother, who later grew ill and died. Brendan claims that he has forgiven his father for the wrong he has done, but Tommy is unconvinced. He refuses to forgive Brendan for not leaving with him and for not being there when their mother was sick.
Meanwhile, the video of Tommy beating ""Mad Dog"" attracts the attention of a Marine in Iraq whose life was saved by Tommy months prior. The information and video of Tommy saving the Marine is shared with the press and Tommy becomes a national hero, gaining a massive fan base and appreciation from not only viewers, but from the U.S. Marine Corps as well. However, Tommy's records surface from the Corps and reveal that he deserted the military after his entire unit was killed in a friendly fire bombing. It is explained that Tommy took his mother's maiden name as his own surname in order to evade arrest for his desertion and that military police will take him into custody after the tournament is over.
Over two nights, Brendan and Tommy have contrasting fortunes: Tommy quickly and brutally knocks out his three opponents, while Brendan has a much tougher time, outmatched physically but utilizing Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to force submissions. The night before the final day, Paddy attempts to talk to Tommy about his actions in Iraq only to be berated and dismissed, which the following morning has caused a distraught Paddy to start drinking again. Seeing his terrible pain, Tommy calms and comforts him. In the end the brothers are the last fighters remaining in the tournament, and despite Brendan's desire to reconcile, they unleash all the anger they have towards one another. The fight between the brothers shows Tommy having the upper hand initially, but Brendan manages to dislocate Tommy's shoulder. Tommy refuses to tap, and finally Brendan traps him in a rear naked choke. While they both lie struggling on the mat, Brendan tearfully apologizes to Tommy and tells him that he loves him. After some hesitation, Tommy taps out. The film ends with the two brothers exiting the ring, Tommy in tears with Brendan's arms around him, as their father watches them reconcile and smiles.","exciting,bleak,emotional,suspenseful,tense,rough,captivating",1761.jpg,2011-09-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/warrior/id467898112?uo=4,54vrgCP5nlc,70141653,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Warrior/70141653,"Action & Adventure,Drama"
3262,Watchmen,"A complex, multi-layered mystery adventure, ""Watchmen"" is set in an alternate 1985 America in which costumed superheroes are part of the fabric of everyday society, and the Doomsday Clock--which charts the USA's tension with the Soviet Union--moves closer to midnight. When one of his former colleagues is murdered, the outlawed but no less determined masked vigilante Rorschach sets out to uncover a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his former crime-fighting legion--a disbanded group of retired superheroes, only one of whom has true powers--Rorschach glimpses a wide-ranging and disturbing conspiracy with links to their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the future. Their mission is to watch over humanity...but who is watching the Watchmen?","The 'Minutemen', a collection of costumed crime fighters, formed in 1938 in response to a rise in costumed gangs and criminals, and the 'Watchmen' similarly form decades later. Their existence in the US has dramatically affected world events: the super powers of Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) help the United States win the Vietnam War, resulting in President Richard Nixon (Robert Wisden) being repeatedly reelected into the 1980s.[4] The existence of Dr. Manhattan gives the West a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which by the 1980s threatens to escalate the Cold War into nuclear war. During that time, growing anti-vigilante sentiment in the country leads to masked crime fighters being outlawed. While many of the heroes retire, Doctor Manhattan and the Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) operate as government-sanctioned agents, and Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) continues to operate outside the law.[5]
Investigating the murder of government agent Edward Blake, Rorschach discovers that Blake was the Comedian, and theorizes that someone may be trying to eliminate the Watchmen. He attempts to warn his retired comrades‚Äö√Ñ√Æhis former partner Daniel Dreiberg/Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), Dr. Manhattan, and the latter's lover Laurie Jupiter/Silk Spectre II (Malin ‚àö√ñkerman). Dreiberg is skeptical, but nonetheless relates the hypothesis to vigilante-turned-billionaire Adrian Veidt/Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), who dismisses it.
After Blake's funeral, Dr. Manhattan is accused of causing the cancers afflicting his former girlfriend and others who spent time with him after the scientific accident that gave him superpowers. Dr. Manhattan exiles himself to Mars, giving the Soviet Union the confidence to invade Afghanistan in his absence. Later, Rorschach's conspiracy theory appears to be justified when Veidt, who had long since made his identity as Ozymandias public before retiring, narrowly avoids an ostensible assassination attempt, and Rorschach finds himself framed for the murder of a former villain, Moloch (Matt Frewer). Meanwhile, Jupiter, after breaking up with Manhattan, goes to stay with Dreiberg, and the two former superheroes come out of retirement, eventually becoming lovers. After breaking Rorschach out of prison, Silk Spectre is confronted by Dr. Manhattan. He takes her to Mars and, after she asks him to save the world, explains he is no longer interested in humanity. As he probes her memories, he discovers she is the product of an affair between her mother, the original Silk Spectre (Carla Gugino), and the Comedian. His interest in humanity renewed by this improbable sequence of events, Manhattan returns to Earth with the Silk Spectre.
Investigating the conspiracy, Rorschach and Nite Owl discover that Veidt is behind everything. Rorschach records his suspicions in his journal, which he drops off at the publication office of New Frontiersman, a right-wing tabloid. Rorschach and Nite Owl confront Veidt at his Antarctic retreat. Ozymandias confirms he is the mastermind behind the Comedian's murder, Manhattan's exile, and the framing of Rorschach; he also staged his own assassination attempt to place himself above suspicion. He explains that his plan is to unify the United States and the Soviet Union, preventing a nuclear war, by destroying the world's main cities with exploding energy reactors he helped Dr. Manhattan create under the pretense of providing free energy for the world. Rorschach and Nite Owl attempt to stop him, but Ozymandias subdues them, and then reveals that his plan has already been set into motion: the reactors have been detonated, and the energy signatures are recognized as Manhattan's.
Silk Spectre and Dr. Manhattan arrive at the ruins of New York City and determine that it must be Veidt's work. They teleport to his Antarctic base just after he has beaten Rorschach and Nite Owl, causing Veidt to retreat and attempt to kill Manhattan. Unsuccessful, he shows them a televised news report in which Nixon states that the US and Soviets have allied against their new ""common enemy"", Dr. Manhattan. The heroes eventually realize that revealing the truth would only disrupt this peace. Rorschach, however, is unwilling to remain silent and forces a reluctant Manhattan to vaporize him. Dr. Manhattan then shares a final kiss with Silk Spectre and departs for another galaxy while an enraged Nite Owl assaults Veidt, who nevertheless defends his actions. Nite Owl and Silk Spectre leave him to muse on his choices.
Silk Spectre and Nite Owl return to New York City, which is being rebuilt, and plan to continue fighting crime. Silk Spectre reveals to her mother that she has learned the Comedian was her father, and the two reconcile. The editor of the New Frontiersman complains of having nothing worthwhile to print because of the new worldwide peace. He tells a young employee that he may print whatever he likes from a collection of crank mailings, among which lies Rorschach's journal.","not afraid,super hero,rockefeller,rorschach,armageddon,hiding in plain sight,doomsday,conspiracy,clock,stylized,soviet,retirement,dr. manhattan,doomsday clock,vigilante,super,sacrifice,veidt,macedonia,watch,killer,bleak,utopia,anticipation,superhero,masked vigilante,murder,investigation,chaos,ultimate weapon,comedian,trust,osterman,friends falling out,inkblot,compassion,save this world,exciting,rapist,suspenseful,nuclear war,anti hero,death of superhero,mothman,epic,alexander the great,one word title,fear",3262.jpg,2009-02-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/watchmen/id308856387?uo=4,NEm4-tGgqYI,70099111,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Watchmen/70099111,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

After their religious-nut mother dies suddenly, it's left to daughters Iris (Ambyr Childers) and Rose (Julia Garner) to take on the annual family tradition of preparing a feast of human flesh. But, despite the threat of their overbearing father (a terrifying Bill Sage), the girls want out.

WAWWA walks a fine line between chilling and, at times, just plain silly, but committed performances (especially from its two young leads), suitably gruesome shocks and a sprinkling of none-more-black humour help to keep it on track.

","Recently widowed Benjamin (Ben) Mee (Matt Damon), still grieving his loss and dealing with school behavior issues with his 14-year-old son, Dylan (Colin Ford), decides to get a fresh start by buying a new house. After touring many houses with his daughter, Rosie (Maggie Elizabeth Jones) and his realtor and finding none to his liking, his daughter finds a paper with what seems like the perfect house he is wanting. They drive up on a beautiful old large house and as Ben inspects the property and tells his realtor it's the perfect home, the realtor tries to explain that the situation is ""complicated"", when they hear a lion roar outside. The realtor explains that the house comes with a zoo in the back and if they want the house, they have to buy the zoo, which closed to the public several years before. Although reluctant to take on a zoo and all of its animals, he decides to give it a try, when he sees how happy his daughter, Rosie, is playing with the peacocks. His son, Dylan, however hates the idea of moving away from his friends, and retreats into his artwork (drawings and paintings which have grown more macabre since the death of his mother). Ben's brother tries to dissuade Ben from purchasing the property, but Ben buys it anyway. The zoo staff, led by head keeper, Kelly (Scarlett Johansson), help Benjamin to start renovating the zoo with the intent to reopen the zoo to the public. When Kelly confronts Ben about why he would buy a zoo, knowing nothing about how to, Ben thinks about it and responds, ""Why not?"" Meanwhile, Dylan befriends a young homeschooled girl named Lily (Elle Fanning) who works at the zoo, and has a huge crush on him, to which he is completely oblivious.
A strict USDA inspector, Walt Ferris (John Michael Higgins), shows up for a surprise inspection and makes a large list of repairs that would cost around $100,000 to do. Benjamin runs into financial trouble with all the expenses of running the zoo and does not have the money needed for the repairs. The zoo worker that handles the accounting gossips to the other workers that Ben is out of money and that he will probably sell the zoo, to which the workers' morale sinks, fearing the property will be sold to a buyer that will close the zoo. When Lily tells him that she heard his family might be leaving, Dylan is overjoyed, which hurts her feelings. Benjamin discovers that his late wife had left him an investment account with instructions to use the money wisely while listening to his heart. Ben's brother advises him to walk away and start over with the money, but Ben decides to use the money to repair the zoo. While this lifts the zoo workers' morale, Dylan is unhappy about having to stay. He confronts his father, and a heated argument ensues. They reconcile the next morning, and Dylan admits he misses Lily. Benjamin gives his son advice on reconciling with her by using his favorite principle, that you only need 20 seconds of courage to achieve great things. Ben realizes that instead of trying to start over by forgetting his wife that she will always be a part of him as he looks through old pictures of their family and remembers them playing as if they were right in front of him.
Prior to the zoo's grand opening, the facility passes a very stringent inspection from the USDA inspector, who begrudgingly wishes them good luck. Dylan, following his father's advice, confesses to Lily that he loves her and she forgives him. Then, Lily and Dylan go into a long and moving hug. The day before opening, the worst rainstorm in over 100 years threatens to wash out the zoo's grand opening, and although the weather clears in time, they are disappointed the next morning when no visitors arrive. They soon discover that a fallen tree has blocked the access road. Scrambling over the tree, Dylan discovers a huge crowd of waiting visitors, who climb over the tree with the zoo staff's help, and pour into the zoo. So many people come to visit that they run out of tickets and Ben and Kelly enter a shed to look for them and end up face to face. Kelly admits to Benjamin that she has a crush on him but, ""can't get a handle on it."" She kisses him, telling him maybe they can do that again on the New Year's eve. Benjamin replies by kissing her and telling her that he is looking forward to New Year's Eve.
At the end, Benjamin takes his children to where he met their mother, explaining that it was the point where they became a ""possibility"". He takes them through that day's encounter, where Ben worked up the nerve to talk to his future wife with ""20 seconds of courage,"" and walks up to the table she was at, and visualizes her actually sitting there, then asks her why such an amazing woman would talk to someone like him. His wife responds, ""Why not?"", echoing the reason why Benjamin bought the zoo in the first place.","courage,bear,snake,widowed father,teenage boy,right reasons,i like the animals. i love the people.,lion,listen,you never know,go for it,the key to talking is listening,take a chance,teenage girl,nothing can stop you,zoo at home,their happy is too loud,insane courage,zoo,stuffed animal,monkey,we bought a zoo,cool animals,zookeeper,inspection,love at first sight,peacock,great things will happen,accountant",2562.jpg,2011-11-26, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/we-bought-a-zoo/id496144170?uo=4,,70202131,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/We_Bought_a_Zoo/70202131,"Comedy,Drama"
2555,We Don't Live Here Anymore,"Two marriages and four lives are brought to a crossroads by infidelity in this drama, based on a pair of short stories by author Andre Dubus. Jack (Mark Ruffalo) is a college professor whose marriage to Terry (Laura Dern) has been going through a rough patch. Beyond the tensions over Terry's failings as a mother and housekeeper, Jack is deeply infatuated with Edith (Naomi Watts), the beautiful wife of his best friend, Hank (Peter Krause), a fellow professor and struggling poet. As it happens, Edith is also attracted to Jack, and they soon begin an affair that Edith is certain will soon be found out. Hank, meanwhile, is a man with a flexible attitude about his own fidelity, and he falls into a relationship with Terry. Before long, all four parties learn about the infidelity of their spouses and friends, with differing reactions; Terry becomes desperate to save her marriage, Jack decides he's in love with Edith, but neither couple is willing to divorce. We Don't Live Here Anymore received its world premiere at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival, where it was honored with the Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi","An indiscretion between two close friends tears down their respective marriages.
The movie is set in the Pacific Northwest; specifically, Washington state. We know this from a glimpse of a license plate, the craftsman architecture of the two houses, and the mature, rich landscapes in between. The setting, like the scrutiny of the four main character's lives, is defined by the narrowness of the camera's field-of view. The one commercial street in town is only seen in the reflection of a store window, a shot of a non-descript auto-yard, or the tunnel of a tree-lined suburban sidewalk. The lush, wooded landscape is understood as an immediate presence in the domestic and professional lives of the characters; a steep hill, railroad tracks, a rushing stream, and a path over an old steel bridge are revisited again and again by the characters in their capacities as lovers, parents and friends.

7318,We Need To Talk About Kevin,"Adapted from Lionel Shriver's 2003 novel, it's the kind of film that's impossible to shrug from your mind. it stays embedded like a sliver of ice, causing you to shudder again days, even weeks, after seeing it. The film's narrative line skitters back and forth across multiple time zones, but it's very soon evident that Kevin, the sullenly detached teenage son of Eva (Tilda Swinton) has done something monstrous, though only near the end of the movie do we learn exactly what it is.

We see Eva at various stages of her life: post-catastrophe, a pariah in her small New England town; in her carefree, pre-Kevin relationship with Franklin (John C. Reilly); and between these two points, desperately striving to raise a child whose attitude to her, and to everything around him, seems fixed from earliest infancy in unrelenting hostility.

The story pivots around an act of horrendous violence, but Ramsay keeps it, and other instances of chilling malevolence, cannily offscreen, leaving our imaginations to run riot. instead, oblique imagery drops disquieting hints from splashes of blood red from the joyous mess of a tomato festival in Latin America to the scarlet paint daubed over Eva's house by her neighbours, or the borderline-unwatchable scene at the dinner table when Kevin, having done something unspeakable to his little sister, sneeringly toys with a peeled lychee.

As the young sociopath, Ezra Miller (Afterschool) gives a scarily convincing performance, his default expression of bored contempt occasionally morphing into a lop-sided grin. Reilly, meanwhile, makes what he can of a thankless role as his father Franklin, breezily in denial of what's breeding in his household. But the film belongs to Tilda Swinton, inhabiting the role of Eva like someone with her skin flayed off and every nerve ending left exposed and screaming.

Hiding from a vengeful neighbour she's glimpsed in the supermarket, she cowers behind a stack of tomato-soup cans (that colour again) as if facing a firing squad. Faithful in tone and structure to Shriver's novel, We Need To Talk about Kevin shows Ramsay extending her range with impressive assurance. But if you were thinking of starting a family, be warned: this film has the power to put you off the idea for life.

Like The Omen without the supernatural guff, Kevin plays on all our worst fears about parenthood. A triumph for ramsay and swinton, but it's a lacerating experience to watch.

Director Lynne Ramsay
","Adolescent Kevin Katchadourian (Ezra Miller) is in prison after committing a massacre at his high school. His mother, Eva (Swinton), a once-successful travel writer, lives alone in a run-down house and works in a mall travel agency in a town near the prison where she visits Kevin. She looks back at her memories of him growing up as she tries to cope with the anger and hostility of her neighbours, who know her to be Kevin's mother. Her memories are shown in flashbacks.
Throughout his life Kevin has been detached and difficult. Eva had problems with identifying as a mother and has trouble bonding with Kevin, which affects his behavior; as a baby he cries incessantly, and as a child he resists toilet training, rebuffs Eva's clumsy attempts at affection, and shows no interest in anything. While he is still small, Eva's frustration with his intractability drives her to throw Kevin against the wall, breaking his arm. They get back from the hospital with Kevin's arm in a cast, and when his father, Franklin (John C. Reilly), asks what happened Kevin says he fell off the changing table onto his toy truck, and that was how it broke. Later there is a scene where his mother is driving him around and he wants to go home but she has to go to the store, and he begins rubbing the scar on his arm menacingly, blackmailing her about telling Franklin about what really happened. When Eva tries to talk to her husband about her increasing concern about Kevin's problems, he dismisses her concerns and makes excuses for Kevin's behavior. Their second child, Celia, is lively and cheerful, but her birth does nothing to lessen the tension within the family.
Kevin finally shows interest in something when Franklin gives him a bow and arrow set and teaches him archery; Kevin soon becomes an excellent marksman. When Celia's pet is killed and she is blinded in one eye by an incident with a caustic cleaning fluid, Eva is convinced Kevin is responsible, while Franklin insists these events were accidents and that their son is blameless. This pattern of suspicion on Eva's part and excuse on Franklin's ruins their marriage and intensifies Eva's fear of her son, as she sees growing evidence of Kevin's pleasure in hurting others. This eventually leads up to the massacre, where Kevin murders multiple students with his bow and arrow set, before locking himself in the gymnasium. It isn't until Eva arrives at the school from work, like the rest of the concerned adults, that Kevin walks out, turning himself over and revealing himself to be the killer, his mother being forced to witness. Eva finally arrives home, only to find the house empty and dark. To her horror, she discovers in the backyard the arrow-penetrated corpses of Franklin and Celia, whom Kevin murdered before his massacre at the school.
The film concludes on the second anniversary of the massacre, when Eva visits Kevin in prison. Kevin is anxious because his transfer to an adult prison is imminent. Eva asks him why he committed the murders and he responds that he thought he used to know, but is no longer sure. Eva gives Kevin a hug and says her good-byes while he is taken away.","death,liar,alienation,murder of daughter,sociopath,massacre,lie,psychopath,memento,sick child,destructiveness,defiance,mass murder,murder,wheelchair,dysfunctional family,killing spree,high school,ostracism,murder of husband,travel writer,school shooting,vandalism,paranoia,evil child,insanity,mental illness,tragic event,violence,eternal damnation,belligerence,anger,travel agency,miscommunication,belief in the afterlife,prozac,apology,cruelty,patricide,sororicide,incarceration,brother kills sister",7318.jpg,2011-10-21,,ZLRgAe2jLaw,,,Drama
601,We Were Here,"David Weissman's critically-acclaimed 2012 Independent Spirit Award nominee, WE WERE HERE is the first documentary to take a deep and reflective look back at the arrival and impact of AIDS in San Francisco. It explores how the City's inhabitants were affected by, and how they responded to, that calamitous epidemic. Though a San Francisco-based story, WE WERE HERE extends beyond San Francisco and beyond AIDS itself. It speaks to our capacity as individuals to rise to the occasion, and to the incredible power of a community coming together with love, compassion, and determination. Offering an intensely personal account of five individuals whose lives were forever transformed by the tragedy of AIDS, WE WERE HERE offers a hauntingly beautiful tribute to an era of tremendous suffering, loss and resilience.","We Were Here documents the coming of what was called the ""Gay Plague"" in the early 1980s. It illuminates the profound personal and community issues raised by the AIDS epidemic as well as the broad political and social upheavals it unleashed. It offers a cathartic validation for the generation that suffered through, and responded to, the onset of AIDS. It opens a window of understanding to those who have only the vaguest notions of what transpired in those years. It provides insight into what society could, and should, offer its citizens in the way of medical care, social services, and community support. -- (C) Official Site",,601.jpg,2011-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/we-were-here/id518174977?uo=4,,70170070,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/We_Were_Here/70170070,Documentary
3181,We Were Soldiers,"The story of the first major battle of the American phase of the Vietnam War and the soldiers on both sides that fought it.
In a place soon to be known as The Valley of Death, in a football field-sized clearing called landing zone X-Ray, Lt. Colonel Hal Moore and 400 young troopers from the elite newly formed American 7th ""Air"" Cavalry, were surrounded by 2,000 North Vietnamese soldiers dug into the tunnel warren mountainside. The ensuing battle was one of the most savage in U.S. history and is portrayed here as the signal encounter between the American and North Vietnamese armies. We Were Soldiers Once... And Young is a tribute to the nobility of those men under fire, their common acts of uncommon valor, and their loyalty to and love for one another.

","A French unit is on patrol in Vietnam in 1954, during the final year of the First Indochina War. The unit is suddenly ambushed by North Vietnamese Army forces, who kill the officers and the unit is overrun. Nguyen Huu An orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers, to discourage further French involvement in Vietnam.
Eleven years later, the United States had entered the Vietnam War. U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore is depicted as dedicated and deeply committed to training troops under his command. He is disquieted when his unit is re-flagged as the 7th Cavalry prior to deployment to Vietnam to being a battalion. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war will be fought ""on the cheap"", without declaring it a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) just prior to shipping out for Vietnam.
After arriving in Vietnam, he learns that an American base has been attacked and is ordered to take his 400 men after the enemy and eliminate the Vietnamese attackers, despite the fact that intelligence has no idea of the number of enemy troops. He leads a newly-created air cavalry unit into the Ia Drang Valley. After landing in the ""Valley of Death"", the soldiers learn that the location they were sent to is actually the base camp for a veteran North Vietnamese Army division of more than 4,000 men.
Upon arrival in the area with a platoon of soldiers, 2nd Lt. Henry Herrick spots a scout, runs after him, and orders reluctant soldiers to follow. The Vietnamese scout lures them into an ambush, resulting in several men of the platoon being killed, including Lt. Herrick and his subordinates. The surviving platoon members are surrounded with no chance of retreat. Sgt. Savage assumes command and calls in artillery and uses the cover of night to keep the Vietnamese from over-running their small defensive position. Meanwhile, with helicopters constantly dropping off the Cavalry units, Lt. Col. Moore manages to secure weak points before the Vietnamese can take advantage of such.
On the second day, despite being trapped and desperately outnumbered, the main U.S. force manages to hold off the Vietnamese with artillery, mortars, and helicopter lifts of supplies and reinforcements. Eventually, enemy Vietnamese commander Nguyen Huu An orders a large scale attack to completely overrun the American position.
At the point of breaking and being completely overrun by the enemy and with no option left, Moore orders his radioman to call in ""Broken Arrow"" (indicating that Moore's position is being overrun and can no longer be defended, and requesting all available combat aircraft to attack the enemy, even those close to the U.S. troops' position). The aircraft attack with bombs, napalm and machine guns, massacring many NVA's and Viet Cong but an accident occurs dangerously close to Moore's men, killing some of Moore's soldiers but successfully repelling the second Vietnamese attack. After the Vietnamese forces are repelled, the surviving men of the stranded platoon, led by Sgt. Savage, are eventually rescued.
Moore's troops regroup, secure the area, and stop at the base of a hill, where Moore surmises the Vietnamese division headquarters is holed up in tunnels. At the same time the Vietnamese commander plans a final assault on the Americans and sends out most of his troops to carry out the attack. The Vietnamese have set up strong defense emplacements near the hidden entrance of the underground passage to the command post spoken of by the scout. Hal and his men charge right at them, into a seemingly impending massacre, but before the Vietnamese can fire, Major Bruce ""Snakeshit"" Crandall and other helicopter gunships attack the Vietnamese, destroying the bulk of the enemy force.
Nguyen Huu An, the Vietnamese Commander, is alerted that the Americans have broken through their lines and there are no soldiers between the Americans and their command post. Since the Commander had deployed his reserve forces to a final offensive and the base camp has no troops to call upon for defense, the Vietnamese commander quickly orders the headquarters evacuated.
Moore, having achieved his objective, returns to the L.Z. (helicopter landing zone) to be picked up. True to his speech to his soldiers before deploying, only after all of his men (including the dead and wounded) are removed from the battlefield does he step on to a helicopter and fly out of the valley.
While the Vietnamese are collecting their dead, Nguyen Huu An, holding a small damaged American flag, tells one of his officers: ""Such a tragedy. They will think this was their victory. So this will become an American war. And the end will be the same (as the French) except for the numbers who will die before we get there.""
At the end of the film, it is revealed that the landing zone immediately reverted to North Vietnamese hands after the American troops were airlifted out. Hal Moore continued the battle in a different landing zone, and after nearly a year he returned home safely. His superiors congratulated him for killing over 1,800 North Vietnamese Army and Viet Cong soldiers. The film ends with an older Moore visiting the Vietnam war memorial and a showing of the names of soldiers who fell at Ia Drang.","first lieutenant,sergeant major,vietnamese,sergeant,army,war memorial,infantry,assault rifle,army base,combat photography,army men,war correspondent,u.s. cavalry,battlefield,u.s. army,friendly fire,rough,uniform,corporal,napalm,journalist,major,air raid,gatling gun,military wife,battle,captivating,vietnam,second lieutenant,air cavalry,hero,heroic military,ambush,military,journalism,vietcong,american soldier,sincere,soldier,training,tense,captain,army life,lieutenant colonel,suspenseful,vietnam war,bittersweet,chinook,gloomy,private",3181.jpg,2002-02-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/we-were-soldiers/id210175685?uo=4,vUsB68-w6Wg,60022697,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/We_Were_Soldiers/60022697,Drama

","On a Friday night in Nottingham, after a house party with his friends, Russell (Tom Cullen) heads out to a gay club, alone and looking for an encounter. Just before closing time he meets Glen (Chris New), an aspiring artist, and they end up sleeping together back in Russell's apartment. The next morning, Glen has Russell speak into a voice recorder about their experience. Glen says this is for an art project. After Glen leaves, Russell writes about Glen on his laptop, something he does about each of the men he has seen.
Russell, who works as a lifeguard, feels lonely about his lot in life. The next day Glen and Russell meet up and the two ride Russell's bike together. Back at Russell's apartment, they spend the day together, sharing stories of their past encounters and their experiences as gay men. Russell confides to Glen how he grew up in a foster home with a friend, Jamie, whom he considered as his brother.
Russell learns that Glen is leaving for Oregon the next day for a two-year art course. This leaves Russell upset. Glen invites him to attend a party he is throwing in a bar that night. Instead of forgetting his developing relationship with Glen, Russell goes to see him in the bar. Russell chats with a friend of Glen's, who reveals that Glen never let her listen to Russell's tape and that Glen usually lets her listen to all of them. She says that she and her friends don't expect Glen to follow through with his America trip, and also that Glen had a relationship with a guy named John, who cheated on him but became a martyr in their relationship and how he got beaten up in the park.
The pair get out of the bar and spend their time in the amusement park where Glen admits that he is never happy and feels down whenever he's with his friends. When they get back to Russell's place, they smoke marijuana and snort cocaine. At one point, Russel admits to Glen that he has something similar to Glen's art project, but his is not for anyone else. He reads some of his entries to Glen. It is revealed that one of the men Russell had slept with had been John, Glen's ex-boyfriend. Glen tries to laugh it off saying ""he'd love this"" ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ referring to his ex. It is not long before they have an argument as Glen speculates that things would be better for him in America, rather than in England. Russell believes they could be happy together, in a relationship. Russell then rebukes Glen for his relationship with John in that John made it difficult for Glen to trust others. Glen then strikes back at Russell telling him that he doesn't know anything about his life and that John couldn't even stand up for himself. This upsets Russell and he leaves to the bathroom.
However, Russell and Glen are reconciled, and soon they passionately share a kiss and sleep together. In the morning, they play a game where Glen pretends to be Russell's father where he could finally come out to him (a chance Russell never had as he never met his father). After Glen leaves, Russell feels desolate and goes to attend the birthday party of his friend Jamie's daughter. Jamie asks him what is wrong and, after some hesitation, Russell finally explains about Glen. Jamie suggests he drop Russell off at the train station to see Glen off. Jamie then drives Russell to the train station, where he chances upon Glen ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ who jokes how he expected him to show up. They say their last goodbyes and Glen kisses Russell, who finally overcomes his fear of being ""out"" in public. Glen hands Russell a present, which was the voice recorder on which Glen had earlier recorded Russell's account of how they met and their first encounter.",,7299.jpg,2011-11-04,https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/weekend/id547084840?uo=4,RUU_WzRBHX4,70178273,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Weekend/70178273,"Romance,Drama"

Yet its unprecedented success with stars such as Dr. Dre, Snoop Doggy Dogg and Tupac, quickly unraveled in a firestorm of rivalries, greed, violence and scrutiny by the government and the media as CEO Marion ""Suge"" Knight's unconventional business practices increasingly mirrored the violent, hard-edged themes of its music.","If you've seen any Tupac Shakur, Jam Master Jay, or Notorious B.I.G. documentaries, then you'd like this one.

You see interviews from Tupac, his security guards, Biggie Smalls, most producers from Death Row, their lawyers, detectives, witnesses, and even Suge Knight.

Something's wrong at the Rileys. Married nearly 30 years, Doug and Lois rarely talk. She doesn't leave their Indianapolis home, and she's ordered a gravestone with their names and birth years on it. He has a long-time Thursday night mistress whom he invites to go with him to a plumbing supply conference in New Orleans. Once there, Doug calls Lois to say he's staying for a while. What's he leaving behind and what's he looking for in New Orleans? And Lois, can she break out? 

A powerful drama about finding hope in the most unusual of places. Once a happily married and loving couple, Doug and Lois Riley (Gandolfini and Leo) have grown apart since losing their teenage daughter eight years prior. Leaving his agoraphobic wife behind to go on a business trip to New Orleans, Doug meets a 16-year-old runaway (Stewart) and the two form a platonic, familial bond. For Lois and Doug, what initially appears to be the final straw that will derail their relationship, turns out to be the inspiration they need to renew their marriage.

","Ever since the death of their daughter Emily, Doug (James Gandolfini) and Lois Riley (Melissa Leo) have been drifting apart. As Lois wrestles with a suffocating sense of guilt over her daughter's death, Doug copes by entering into an affair with Vivian, a local waitress. Lately, Lois hasn't even been able to muster the courage to venture outside, summoning hairdressers to her home in order to maintain appearances and communicating with few people other than her sister Harriet and the local pastor. When Vivian dies and Doug finds himself in a New Orleans strip club during a business trip, he realizes he's come to a dangerous crossroads in life.
Turning down an offer for a private dance by 16-year-old stripper Mallory (Kristen Stewart), Doug instead accompanies the girl home and makes a most unusual proposition: If Mallory will allow him to stay in her run-down house long enough to straighten himself out, he will pay her $100 a day for her trouble. For Mallory, who isn't used to getting money for nothing, it seems like a great deal. She accepts, and Doug phones Lois to tell her he won't be coming home. As time passes, Doug and Mallory settle into an unconventional kind of domesticity.
Meanwhile, back home, Lois realizes that she'll have to act fast in order to save her marriage, even if that means venturing well outside her comfort zone for the first time in nearly a decade. Most days she can't even make it to the mailbox, but after a couple of attempts, Lois manages to start up her car and get on the freeway heading south. When Lois arrives in Louisiana and discovers that her husband is living with a foul-mouthed, underage stripper, she is at first horrified. Like Doug before her, however, Lois quickly warms to Mallory due in part to her striking similarities to Emily. Before long, Lois, too, has moved in, and the three form an unconventional family. But when Lois attempts to steer Mallory from the path of self-destruction, the young girl bristles. Mallory is arrested after an altercation with a client, and Doug and Lois rush to be by her side, but shortly after they bail her out, she runs away. Doug and Lois realize they cannot use Mallory as a substitute for their daughter and return to Indianapolis. Shortly after returning and settling back at home, Doug receives a phone call from Mallory in Houston. She announces her plans about moving to Las Vegas, just before boarding the bus. Doug clarifies to her that she will always be supported by his family, if any needs should come. Doug and Lois finally begin to re-engage with the world.","champagne,jerking off ,prostitute,new orleans louisiana,striptease,teenage prostitute,$100,exposed thong underwear,teenager,fuck nuts,underage,runaway,teen prostitute,death of daughter,hooker,louisiana,french quarter,champagne bottle,matress,tricks,champagne room,private lap dance,business trip,strip club,tuna fish,cooter,toilet brush,plumber,po'boy,i bet your balls smell just like apple fritters,stripper,shithole",71.jpg,2010-01-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/welcome-to-the-rileys/id417006171?uo=4,HlSPOzQG-Uk,70121928,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Welcome_to_the_Rileys/70121928,Drama

","Act I
The film opens in the streets of Manhattan in the late summer of 1957. There is a mounting tension set to music (""Prologue"") between a white American gang, the Jets, led by Riff Lorton (Russ Tamblyn), and a rival gang of Puerto Rican immigrants, the Sharks, led by Bernardo Nu‚àö¬±ez (George Chakiris). The Jets harass the Sharks and vice versa, culminating in a free-for-all throughout the streets. Eventually, the Sharks catch the youngest member of the Jets, Baby John (Eliot Feld) on the playground. As they begin to ""bloody"" him, all the other Jets and Sharks rush in and start brawling. Soon, Lieutenant Schrank (Simon Oakland) and Officer Krupke (William Bramley) arrive and break up the melee. Schrank orders the Sharks off the playground and the Jets ""to make nice with them Puerto Ricans"" or there'll be a price to pay. Once Schrank and Krupke are gone, the Jets discuss challenging the Sharks to an all out rumble that will decide who gets control of the streets. They decide to deliver the challenge to the Sharks at a dance later that night, because it is neutral territory. Riff also explains to the Jets that they have seen other gangs (the Emeralds and the Hawks) come and go, but the Jet members state that the Sharks are different compared to the other gangs. However, Riff eases the statement, that no matter the odds or the situation the Jets will always pull through.
Riff decides that his best friend Tony Wycek (Richard Beymer), a co-founder of the Jets who has left the gang to work at a local candy/drug store, would be the best member to present the challenge to the Sharks because he has always come through for the Jets (""Jet Song""). Riff visits Tony at the store and asks him to come to the dance, but Tony is not interested. He tells Riff that he senses something very important is about to happen to him. After a little cajoling from Riff, Tony changes his mind and agrees to meet him and the Jets at the dance, in case it is there that he will discover that ""something"" (""Something's Coming"").
Bernardo, along with his friend, Chino, arrives to take his sister Maria (Natalie Wood) and his girlfriend Anita (Rita Moreno) to the dance. At the dance, which is held at the gym, the Jets, Sharks, and girls are greatly enjoying themselves (""Dance at the Gym""). The host of the dance, social worker Glad Hand (John Astin), tries to get the members of the rival gangs to dance together. Even so, the rival gang members and their girlfriends remain apart. During a mambo, Tony and Maria see each other, become infatuated, going into a trance-like state, and begin to dance, oblivious to the rivalry between their ethnic groups. They eventually kiss, but Bernardo angrily interrupts them. He orders Maria home and tells Tony to stay away from his sister. It's at this point that Riff proposes a ""war council"" with Bernardo, who agrees to meet at Doc's drug store after the dance. Tony leaves in a happy daze, singing of his newfound love (""Maria"").
Maria is sent home, and Anita argues with Bernardo that they are in America, not Puerto Rico. At the Sharks' apartment building, Anita and other girls from Puerto Rico engage in a spirited argument with Bernardo in defense of Maria's right to dance with whomever she pleases. They debate the advantages and disadvantages of their country (""America""). Eventually the women and the men disperse as Bernardo and his gang go to the war council.
Tony discreetly visits Maria outside the fire escape at her home and they confirm their love (""Tonight""). They arrange to meet the next day at the bridal shop where Maria works. Meanwhile, the Jets gather outside of Doc's store to wait for the Sharks. They are visited by Officer Krupke, who warns them not to cause trouble on his beat. After he leaves, they lampoon him and the various theories of how to deal with juvenile delinquency (""Gee, Officer Krupke!""). Doc (Ned Glass) is about to close the store, but the Jets convince him to stay open. The Sharks finally arrive and the war council begins. In the middle of this, Tony arrives and calls them chickens for having to fight with weapons. He demands that they have a fair one-on-one fist fight instead of an all-out rumble. The gang leaders agree, with Bernardo representing the Sharks and Ice (Tucker Smith) representing the Jets (much to Bernardo's disappointment, as he was hoping to face Tony). They are soon alerted of Lieutenant Schrank's arrival, so the gangs quickly intermix together and feign happiness and fun. Schrank pretends that it is a good thing that they are getting along and remarks he might even get a promotion, but he knows what they are up to. Schrank stamping orders the Puerto Ricans out (while they whistle ""My Country, 'Tis of Thee""), then asks the Jets where the rumble is taking place,in the process angering several members with sarcastic and insulting coments including A-Rab's father (and especially Action) who Schrank implies his mother is a prostitute, which angers Action who almost attacks Schrank, but is restrained by the other Jets much to the lieutenant's pleasure. Soon, the Jets disperse and Schrank leaves as well, leaving Tony and Doc alone in the store to clean up. Tony, who is in a good mood, surprises Doc and tells him about his love for Maria. The day comes to an end as a distressed Doc closes the store and Tony leaves.
[edit]Act II
The next day at Madam Lucia's bridal shop, Maria sings to her co-workers about how happy and excited she is (""I Feel Pretty""). After everyone except Maria and Anita leaves, Anita tells Maria about the impending rumble accidentally. Anita tells Maria to go home, but Maria insists that she wants to close the store by herself because she has work to do. Suddenly, Tony arrives to see Maria, leaving Anita in shock. Tony tells Anita of his and Maria's love, and Anita mocks Maria. Although Anita is initially shocked to see that Maria and Tony are having a romance, she shows some tolerance but worries about the consequences if Bernardo were to find out. Anita, who is also Maria's roommate, leaves to prepare for a planned date with Bernardo after the rumble. Maria pleads with Tony to prevent the rumble altogether, even if it is only a fist fight, and Tony promises to do so. Then Tony and Maria, using clothes in the bridal shop, fantasize about their wedding (""One Hand, One Heart""). They use the headless mannequins as their parents, best man (Riff) and Maid of Honor (Anita). They exchange wedding vows and kiss.
A musical montage (""Quintet"") intertwines the feelings of the Jets and Sharks in anticipation of the rumble, Tony and Maria's anticipation of meeting each other, and Anita preparing for her date with Bernardo. The Jets and Sharks arrive at their agreed location for the rumble, a fenced dead-end under a stretch of New York highway. As the ""fair fight"" begins between Bernardo and Ice, Tony arrives and tries to stop it, but is met with ridicule and mockery from Bernardo and the Sharks. Unable to stand by and watch his best friend be humiliated, Riff angrily lashes out and punches Bernardo (""The Rumble""). Drawing their knives, Riff and Bernardo fight each other. Riff gets the upper hand attempting to stab Bernardo but Tony stops him. Riff breaks away and runs back into the fight, only to be fatally stabbed by Bernardo. Riff collapses while handing the knife to Tony and Bernardo looks shocked at what he has done. Enraged, Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife, resulting in a full-fledged melee. Suddenly, police sirens blare out and the gang members flee, leaving behind the bodies of Riff and Bernardo.
Blissfully unaware of what has happened, Maria is waiting for Tony on the roof of her apartment building. One of the Sharks, Chino (Jose DeVega), whom Maria has been promised to, arrives and angrily tells her that Tony killed her brother. Tony arrives, and initially Maria lashes out at him in anger, but Tony explains what happened and asks for her forgiveness before he plans to turn himself in to the police. Maria decides that she still loves Tony and begs him to stay with her. They reaffirm their love (""Somewhere""), kiss, and make love for the first time (offscreen).
Meanwhile, the Jets (with Ice now in command and joined by the Jet girls) have reassembled outside a garage. Action demands revenge for Riff's death, but Baby John as well as A-Rab, opposes it. Action yells at Baby John and for being scared, A-Rab protects Baby-John and lashes out against Action, then tensions flare amongst several Jets. When a man in an upper apartment window throws a glass piece that breaks on the ground to scare off the jets as well as with his yelling, Action attempts to throw a rock at the man, however, he is subdued by Ice, who pulls all of the jets into the garage and tells them they will have their revenge on the Sharks, but must do it carefully at ease, or get caught and to pay the consequences for their actions. (""Cool""). When all of the Jets have cooled down, they each quietly file out of the garage and make their way back to Doc's Candy Store when Anybodys (Susan Oakes), a tomboy who is desperate to join the Jets, arrives after infiltrating the Sharks' turf and warns them that Chino is now after Tony with a gun. Ice sends the Jets to various locations to find Tony and warn him. Anybodys' persistence finally pays off as Ice asks her to search in and out of the shadows and commends her for her deed.
In Maria's bedroom, she and Tony have just finished making love. Tony puts a small mysterious box on Maria's bedroom with the words ""Capullo de Rosa"". The couple hear Anita arriving home, and Maria and Tony make quick, whispered arrangements to meet at Doc's drug store and run away together to marry. Anita hears through the door and knows that something is going on. Tony escapes through the bedroom window and flees, but Anita sees him running away. Anita chides Maria for the relationship (""A Boy Like That""). Anita says that a man who kills is bad, but she soon softens as Maria sings back. Maria's heartfelt love (""I Have a Love"") wins over Anita, and despite her grief over Bernardo's death, Anita agrees to cooperate with a plan to help Maria and Tony run away and marry, because she is her friend. Anita quickly tells Maria that Chino is searching for Tony with a gun.
Lieutenant Schrank arrives and questions Maria about the events leading up to the rumble, but Maria is protective of Tony and lies to cover for him. To deceive the policeman, Maria sends Anita to Doc's drugstore on the pretense that she is fetching medicine for her headache. She asks Anita to say she has been detained, explaining she would have gone herself otherwise. Anita's real purpose is to tell Tony (who is found by Anybodys outside Maria's apartment and takes refuge in the cellar of Doc's drugstore) that Maria is detained from meeting him. But when Anita enters the drugstore and asks for Tony, the Jets mock, harass, and mock rape her until Doc stops them. Infuriated by the attack, Anita gives the Jets a different message for Tony: Maria is dead, shot by Chino for loving Tony. Doc reproaches the Jets, then delivers the message to Tony. In shock and despair, Tony runs to find Chino, shouting ""Come and get me, too!"", and not knowing that Chino is actually secretly waiting for him.
Now on the playground next to Doc's store, Tony suddenly sees Maria and they begin to run toward each other with joy. Suddenly, Chino appears and shoots Tony. As the Jets and Sharks arrive, Maria and a fatally wounded Tony reaffirm their love (""Somewhere""), but Tony dies in her arms. Maria takes the gun from Chino and blames the rival gang members for the deaths of Tony, Bernardo, and Riff with their hate, threatening to kill as many of them as she can, while still leaving one bullet for herself. However, she can't do it and drops the gun before sinking to the ground, crying. Three of the Jets start lifting his body and two Sharks join them to help carry him off. Maria and several Jets and Sharks walk behind them in a funeral procession and Chino is arrested and led away by Schrank and Krupke for killing Tony.","stylized,bittersweet,emotional,captivating,touching",3568.jpg,1961-10-18, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/west-side-story/id253021356?uo=4,yA_aFprGzyc,,,"Drama,Musical & Performing Arts,Romance"

891,Whatever Works,"Attempting to impress his ideologies on religion, relationships, and the randomness (and worthlessness) of existence, lifelong New York resident Boris Yellnikoff rants to anyone who will listen, including the audience. But when he begrudgingly allows naive Mississippi runaway Melodie St. Ann Celestine to live in his apartment, his reclusive rages give way to an unlikely friendship and Boris begins to mold the impressionable young girl's worldly views to match his own. When it comes to love, ""whatever works"" is his motto, but his already perplexed life complicates itself further when Melodie's parents eventually track her down.

","Boris Yelnikoff (Larry David) is a misanthropic chess teacher and former Columbia professor. Divorced, he eschews human contact except for his friends (Michael McKean, Adam Brooks, Lyle Kanouse) and students, criticizing everyone he meets for not matching him intellectually.
Boris comes home one night to find Melodie (Evan Rachel Wood), a simpleminded 21-year-old, lying on his doorstep. He reluctantly lets her in for a meal and soon she tells him her story. She turns out to be of a distinctly southern background, having been born to fundamentalist parents in Mississippi and ran away from them. She asks if she can stay the night, which Boris eventually allows, and she stays with him while she's looking for a job. Melodie develops a crush on Boris despite their age difference and their varying cultures and intelligence.
Melodie finds a job as a dog walker while still living with Boris. Out on the job, she meets Perry (John Gallagher, Jr.) and they arrange a date. When she comes back home, she explains to Boris that she didn't like Perry because he loved everything in the world too much. Boris realizes that he loves her and they get married.
After a year passes, her mother Marietta (Patricia Clarkson) finds Melodie, explaining that she and her husband John (Ed Begley, Jr.) thought Melodie had been kidnapped. She goes on to tell her that John left her and sold their house after John lost money in the stock market. She meets Boris and is disappointed with him, so she tries to convince Melodie to end her marriage. The three go for lunch at a restaurant and meet Boris' friend, Leo (Conleth Hill). As Marietta goes to use the restroom, Randy James (Henry Cavill) inquires about Melodie. Marietta slyly decides to recruit him to end Melodie's marriage. Later that evening, Leo, who had taken an interest in Marietta, asks her over for dinner. They spend the evening together, and they both discover that she is a wonderful photographer and he even makes plans to contract her professionally.
Boris explains to the audience that the next few weeks, Marietta changed and started experimenting in artistic photography, exotic new habits, and having a polyamorous relationship with Leo and his business partner, Morgenstern (Olek Krupa). Marietta still hates Boris and continues to arrange for Melodie to marry Randy. She takes her to an outdoor craft market and ""accidentally"" runs into Randy, who questions her about her marriage. Later shopping for clothes, Melodie meets Randy in another planned encounter with her and gets her to admit that her relationship with Boris is not entirely satisfying. He invites her to the boat he lives on, and the two end up kissing and beginning an affair.
John arrives at Boris and Melodie's home full of regret and hopes to get the family back together. They all go to Marietta's photography exhibit opening together, and he sees how his ex-wife has changed since she moved to New York. Distraught, he retreats to a bar, drinking away his misery. While there, he meets a recently divorced gay man named Howard (Christopher Evan Welch), and realizes that he is also gay.
Melodie tells Boris she is in love with Randy. Boris is disheartened by this and jumps out a window again, but this time lands on Helena (Jessica Hecht) breaking her arm and leg. As he visits her in the hospital, he asks her if there is anything he can do to make up with her, and Helena says she would like to go to dinner with Boris.
Finally, Boris hosts a New Year's Eve party, at which everyone is seen in their new relationships: Marietta with Leo and Morgenstern, John with Howard, Melodie with Randy, and finally Boris with Helena. Melodie and her parents had, each one separately, completely shed their former southern conservative mindsets and wholeheartedly adopted the liberal New York way of life and values. (John tells that his former membership in the National Rifle Association had been but a sublimation of his repressed homosexuality). They are now all the best of friends, and at midnight heralding a new year they kiss and Boris tells the audience that you just have to find all the enjoyment that you can, that you have to find ""whatever works.""

Forney, who watched her go into the store at closing time, jumps through a plate-glass window and helps deliver her baby daughter.
Novalee wakes up in the hospital to find she is a media celebrity for giving birth in a Wal-Mart. She befriends her nurse, Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), and tells her that her daughter's name will be Americus ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ as Moses had suggested she give her baby a strong name. Lexie reveals that she is a single woman with four children by three different men. Novalee's mother (Sally Field), who abandoned her as a child, has seen her on television and appears at the hospital. Her mother says that the two women can get an apartment together, takes the $500 that Novalee received from the President of Wal-Mart, and agrees to pick up Novalee and Americus the next morning. Her mother never shows up, and Sister Husband comes to pick up Novalee and offers to let Novalee and the baby live at her house.
Novalee's ex-boyfriend Willy Jack Pickens is shown getting into trouble with the law, trying to develop as a country singer while in prison, and after prison he signs on with music agent Ruth Meyers (Joan Cusack).
Novalee is shown to be enjoying her life at Sister Husband's house, sharing a friendship with Forney, working at Wal-Mart and having a pregnancy scare after sleeping with a young mechanic in town. One night, while Novalee and Forney are getting Christmas trees, Forney remarks that Americus is 5 months old that day. Novalee panics over her unlucky number and races home to find out that Americus was kidnapped. Sister Husband tells the police about the extremely religious couple from Midnight, Mississippi, who came to her house to give the ""Wal-Mart Baby"" the word of God. Novalee remembers that, in the hospital, she received a card from Midnight saying her baby was an abomination under God. The police quickly apprehend a vehicle with Mississippi plates and Americus is found safe in Baby Jesus's place in a nativity scene outside a church.
Five years pass, and Novalee begins an award winning career as a photographer with the help of Moses. When a tornado blows through town, Sister Husband is killed and their home is destroyed. After the funeral, one of Sister Husband's friends from Alcoholics Anonymous informs Novalee that she is the beneficiary of Sister's estate, worth around $41,000. Novalee proceeds to build a new home for herself and Americus on Sister's land.
One day, Novalee receives a call from Lexie's oldest child. She rushes over to find Lexie bruised and battered, and brings her and her (now) five children to live with her and Americus in their new house. Lexie tells Novalee that her latest boyfriend had gone to her house and tried to molest her two oldest children, when Lexie returned home from work early and caught him. Lexie eventually marries the ordinary but reliable ""Ernie the Exterminator"" and has a sixth child.
When Forney‚Äö√Ñ√¥s sister passes away and he does not appear at the funeral, Novalee finds him in a hotel and comforts him. After they sleep together, Forney says he loves her and wants to get a factory job and stay with her. Novalee lies and says she does not love him‚Äö√Ñ√Æwhich frees him to return to Bowdoin College in Maine.
On Americus's 5th birthday, Novalee is paranoid about her party because of the unlucky 5. She picks up a newspaper and reads a story about a double amputee being robbed of his wheelchair. The man proves to be Willy Jack, who lost his legs when he became an endless drunk after being sued for copyright infringement for ""his"" hit song. Novalee visits Willy in the hospital and tells him about what happened to her. He admits that he lied to her when he told her that he didn't feel the baby's heart beat the day he left her behind. Willy says he wishes he could go back and undo the lie, because of how one lie can change your whole life. Willy explains people lie because they're ""scared, crazy, or just mean"". Novalee realizes that she made a similar mistake lying to Forney. She drives Willy Jack home to Tennessee and then continues to Maine to find Forney at college. Novalee admits to him that she lied and that she really loves him and they return to Oklahoma to get married in their Wal-Mart.",,3840.jpg,2000-04-28, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/where-the-heart-is/id273382037?uo=4,,60000925,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Where_the_Heart_Is/60000925,"Comedy,Drama"
7334,Whip it,"In Bodeen, Texas, an indie-rock loving misfit finds a way of dealing with her small-town misery after she discovers a roller derby league in nearby Austin.

In a town near Austin, Bliss Cavendar's strong-willed mom believes Bliss, at 17, can win pageants - the key to a happy life. Bliss isn't the beauty pageant type: she's shy, quiet, and has just one friend, Pash, her fellow waitress at a diner. Things change for Bliss when she discovers a women's roller derby league in Austin, tries out, proves to be whip fast, and makes a team. Now she needs to become someone tough on the rink, keep her parents from finding out where she goes twice a week, and do something about a first crush, on a musician she meets at the derby. Meanwhile, mom still sees Bliss as Miss Bluebonnet. Things are on a collision course; will everyone get banged up?

","Bliss Cavendar (Ellen Page) is a misfit in the small town of Bodeen, Texas, with no sense of direction in her life. Her mother, Brooke (Marcia Gay Harden), a former beauty queen, pushes her to enter beauty pageants despite her lack of interest. Bliss and her best friend, Pash (Alia Shawkat), dream of escaping. Pash plans to attend an Ivy League school in a big city, but Bliss is uncertain as to what she wants for her future. During a shopping trip to Austin with her mother, Bliss encounters three roller derby team members. Intrigued, she and Pash attend a roller derby bout under the pretense of going to a football game, where they see the Holy Rollers defeat the Hurl Scouts, a perennially unsuccessful derby team.[3] Bliss tells the Hurl Scouts that they are ""her new heroes"" and is suddenly drawn to the idea of being a roller derby skater herself when one of the Hurl Scouts, Maggie Mayhem (Kristen Wiig) replies, ""Well, put some skates on. Be your own hero.""
Returning to Austin, Bliss lies about her age and tries out for the Hurl Scouts, discovering her natural skating abilities in the process. After realizing she needs to be ruthless in roller derby, Bliss sees she needs to take charge in other aspects of her life, revealed through various subplots. One involves Bliss' love interest, a lanky young rock guitarist and singer named Oliver (Landon Pigg) whom she meets via her exposure to roller derby. They enjoy a whirlwhind romance and an underwater lovemaking session before Oliver leaves for a tour, taking a T-shirt Bliss gave him to remember her by. She later finds a picture of him at a gig with another girl, who is wearing her t-shirt. She breaks up with him following his return, although he vehemently denies that anything happened.
Another sub-plot examines Bliss' relationship with her parents, a loving but controlling mother and an amiable but clueless father (Daniel Stern) who seldom opposes his wife's parental decisions. Although, eventually, Bliss' father convinces her mother to let Bliss out of a pageant (which is at the same time as the championship roller derby game) and convinces the Hurl Scouts to come get Bliss for the bout. Various other sub-plots include her relationship with Pash, and confrontations with a stuck up snob at school. Pash is fine with Bliss' new path, until she gets arrested with an open container of beer while she is waiting for Bliss, who has left to go find Oliver. Eventually, Pash gets together with their manager and forgives Bliss. The movie ends with the Hurl Scouts narrowly losing the championship match and everyone finally getting along; the team chants ""We're number two!"" which was the same thing they chanted when they lost their first match.","raised middle finger,rivalry,small town,green bra,women's sports,gym locker,vomiting in a toilet,young athlete,roller skating,practice,college acceptance,waitress,roller skate,star athlete,deaf athlete,infidelity,underdog loses,beauty pageant,roller skater,roller skates,buddy holly,pinball,swimming in one's underwear,female athlete,jumping into a pool with clothes on,mother daughter conflict,teenage girl,austin texas,training,texas,friend,roller derby,trespassing,pie in the face,lying about age,coach,athlete,bong,babe ruth,coming of age,knocked her up,pageant,smart girls,stuffed in a locker,trophy,playbook,blue hair,jabba the hut",7334.jpg,2009-10-02,,,,,"Sports & Fitness,Drama"
413,White Men Can't Jump,"Black and white basketball hustlers join forces to double their chances. Billy and Sydney think they're the best basketball hustlers in town, so when they join forces, nothing can stop them, except each other. To add to their problems, Billy owes money and is being chased by a pair of gangster types.

""White Men Can't Jump"" is a slam dunk, high-flying comedy hit!

","Billy Hoyle (Harrelson) is a former college basketball player who makes a living hustling streetballers who assume he cannot play well because he is white. Hoyle never downplays his skill to increase the stakes; it is the black basketball players' own assumptions that are at the root of the hustle.
Such a talented but arrogant player is Sidney Deane (Wesley Snipes), a star on the Venice Beach, California outdoor courts. He is humiliated twice by Billy in front of his friends, losing a wager. But he also recognizes a good thing when he sees one and immediately begins to think of a number of ways Billy can be useful to him.
Billy and his girlfriend Gloria Clemente (Rosie Perez) are on the run from out-of-state mobsters because of a gambling debt. A voracious reader, making note of obscure facts, Gloria's goal in life is to be a contestant on the television show Jeopardy! and make a fortune. Sidney's mission in life is to buy a house for his family outside the rough Baldwin Village, Crenshaw District neighborhood of Los Angeles. He talks Billy into a partnership and they hustle other players for money. But when they unexpectedly lose a game, it turns out that Sidney has double-crossed Billy by deliberately playing badly alongside him, making Billy lose $1,700 to a group of Sidney's friends.
Gloria is incensed at Billy's blowing his money again and is also suspicious of how it happened. On the way to Sidney's apartment, she tells Billy: ""Sometimes when you win, you really lose. And sometimes when you lose, you really win. And sometimes when you win or lose, you actually tie and sometimes when you tie, you actually win or lose. Winning or losing is all one organic globule, from which one extracts what one needs.""
Once they get to Sidney's and appeal to his wife (Tyra Ferrell) for fairness, Gloria agrees to share some of the money provided Sidney and Billy are willing to team up again for a major 2-on-2 outdoor tournament. While they bicker incessantly, Sidney and Billy do win the grand prize of $5,000, largely due to Billy's ability to disrupt his opponents' concentration. Billy's most notable claim is that he is ""in the zone,"" a state of mind in which nothing can get in his way. Sidney is pleased with the outcome, yet he cannot help mocking Billy about his inability to slam dunk. ""White men can't jump,"" he notes. Billy claims that dunking the basketball is unnecessary grandstanding, while expressing a belief that black guys like Sidney would ""rather look good and lose than look bad and win.""
Billy insists that he can indeed dunk but Sidney clearly disagrees. Infuriated, Billy claims he is willing to bet his share of the $5,000 on his ability to dunk. Sidney accepts and gives him three chances. Billy fails, losing his share. When he tells Gloria, she leaves him. One of Sidney's friends works as a security guard at the TV studio that produces Jeopardy!. He agrees to get her on the show, if Billy can sink a hook shot from beyond the half-court line, which he does. To begin, Gloria stumbles over sports questions (notably naming Babe Ruth as the NBA's leading rebounder), but makes a comeback with a pet topic, ""Foods That Start With The Letter 'Q' "". She wins $14,100 on her first episode. Gloria and Billy get back together.
Billy sings Gloria a song he has composed to win her back. Everything in his world is all right again, but now it is Sidney who suffers misfortune and needs a favor. He and his family are burglarized and become more desperate for money. Billy is supposed to get a steady job and settle down, but Sidney needs him to play basketball for money again and use his share of Gloria's take. Gloria warns that if Billy gambles with her money ""we are through."" Billy feels he must honor the obligation he owes Sidney for getting Gloria on Jeopardy! in the first place. They play a final game against two hoops legends of the L.A. scene, ""The King"" and ""Duck."" In a very tight game, Sidney and Billy prevail, the winning points coming when Sidney lobs an ""alley-oop"" pass to Billy, who dunks it.
Returning home happy, Billy discovers Gloria has kept her word and left him for good. He is crushed. Then the mobsters who are after Billy track him down and he pays off his debts. Billy once again asks Sidney to set him up with a real job. Billy says that Gloria has left him many times, but that ""this is it"", and Sidney remarks ""Maybe you two were better off without each other."" As the closing credits are about to roll, Billy launches into yet another basketball argument with Sidney and they are right back where they began‚Äö√Ñ√Æbut, this time, as friends.","con,dunk,motherfucking,listen to the woman,color in title,jeopardy,smoke or you get smoked,hustle,basketball,lose it all,buddy,anticipation,oh man shut your anorexic malnutrition tapeworm-having overdose on dick gregory bahamian diet-drinking ass up,slam dunk,trust,con artist,winning or losing,hoop,swish,anger,basketball movie,basket,leave me alone,white men can't jump,sizzler,chump,hoops",413.jpg,1992-03-27, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/white-men-cant-jump/id371238237?uo=4,g4aNy-3n1GU,,,"Comedy,Drama"

From the shores of California, Hawaii, Mexico, and Puerto Rico to the basketball courts of New York City, through the cotton fields of the Mississippi Delta up to the ivory towers of Texas and back into the swimming pools of Florida, White Wash is a historical exploration of race, identity, and the myths we live by and that ultimately unite us all.

256,Who Framed Roger Rabbit,"It's 1947 Hollywood, and Eddie Valiant (Bob Hoskins), a down-on-his-luck detective, is hired to find proof that Marvin Acme, gag factory mogul and owner of Toontown, is playing hanky-panky with femme fatale Jessica Rabbit, wife of Maroon Cartoon superstar Roger Rabbit. When Acme is found murdered, all fingers point to Roger, and the sinister, power-hungry Judge Doom (Christopher Lloyd) is on a mission to bring Roger to justice. Roger begs the Toon-hating Valiant to find the real evildoer and the plot thickens as Eddie uncovers scandal after scandal and realizes the very existence of Toontown is at stake! WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT is deliciously outrageous fun the whole family will enjoy.","In 1947, cartoon characters, commonly called ""toons"", are living beings who act out cartoons in the same way that human actors make live-action production. Toons interact freely with humans and live in Toontown, an area near Hollywood, California. R. K. Maroon is the human owner of Maroon Cartoon studios; Roger Rabbit is a fun-loving toon rabbit, one of Maroon's stars; Roger's wife Jessica Rabbit is a gorgeous toon woman; and Baby Herman is Roger's costar, a 50-year-old toon who looks like an infant. Marvin Acme is the practical joke-loving owner of Toontown and the Acme Corporation.
Maroon hires private detective Eddie Valiant to investigate rumors that Jessica is having an extramarital affair. Eddie and his brother Teddy used to be friends of the toon community, but Eddie has hated them, and has been drinking heavily, since Teddy was killed by a toon a few years earlier. When he shows Roger photographs of Jessica ""cheating"" on him by playing patty-cake with Acme, Roger becomes distraught and runs away. This makes him the prime suspect when Acme is found murdered the next day. At the crime scene, Eddie meets Judge Doom and his Toon Patrol of weasel henchmen. Although toons are impervious to physical abuse, Doom has discovered that they can be killed by submerging them in a mixture of solvents he refers to as ""Dip.""
Baby Herman insists that Acme's will, which is missing, bequeaths Toontown to the toons. If the will is not found by midnight, Toontown will be sold to Cloverleaf Industries, which recently bought the Pacific Electric system of trolley cars. One of Eddie's photos shows the will in Acme's pocket, proving Baby Herman's claim. After Roger shows up at his office professing his innocence, Eddie investigates the case with help from his girlfriend Dolores while hiding Roger from the Toon Patrol. Jessica tells Eddie that Maroon blackmailed her into compromising Acme, and Eddie learns that Maroon is selling his studio to Cloverleaf. Maroon explains to Eddie that Cloverleaf will not buy his studio unless they can also buy Acme's gag-making factory. His plan was to use the photos to blackmail Acme into selling. Before he can say more, he is killed by an unseen assassin and Eddie sees Jessica fleeing the scene. Thinking that she is the killer, Eddie pursues her into Toontown. When he finds her, she explains that Doom killed Maroon and Acme in an attempt to take over Toontown.
Eddie, Jessica, and Roger are captured by Doom and his weasels and held at the Acme Factory, where Doom reveals his plan. Since he owns Cloverleaf and Acme's will has yet to turn up, he will take control of Toontown and destroy it with a mobile Dip-sprayer to make room for a freeway, then force people to use it by dismantling the trolley fleet and make a fortune through a series of businesses built to appeal to the motorists. With Roger and Jessica tied up, Eddie performs a vaudeville act that makes all but one of the weasels literally die of laughter (the leader is subjected to the Dip) and confronts Doom. Doom survives being run over by a steamroller, revealing that he himself is a toon and admitting that he killed Teddy. Eddie eventually dissolves Doom in the Dip by opening the drain on the Dip machine. As toons and the police arrive, Eddie discovers that an apparently blank piece of paper on which Roger wrote a love poem to Jessica is actually Acme's will, written in disappearing/reappearing ink. Eddie kisses Roger‚Äö√Ñ√Æproving that he has regained his sense of humor‚Äö√Ñ√Æand the toons celebrate their victory.","exciting,sexy,joy,witty,humorous,stylized,feel good,offbeat",256.jpg,1988-06-21, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/who-framed-roger-rabbit/id492265546?uo=4,OzuXjep6pbs,,,"Action & Adventure,Animation,Comedy,Kids & Family,Mystery & Suspense"

2571,Who Stole the Electric Car?,"A documentary that investigates the birth and death of the electric car, as well as the role of renewable energy and sustainable living in the future.

With gasoline prices approaching $4/gallon, fossil fuel shortages, unrest in oil producing regions around the globe and mainstream consumer adoption and adoption of the hybrid electric car (more than 140,000 Prius' sold this year), this story couldn't be more relevant or important. The foremost goal in making this movie is to educate and enlighten audiences with the story of this car, its place in history and in the larger story of our car culture and how it enables our continuing addiction to foreign oil. This is an important film with an important message that not only calls to task the officials who squelched the Zero Emission Vehicle mandate, but all of the other accomplices, government, the car companies, Big Oil, even Eco-darling Hydrogen as well as consumers, who turned their backs on the car and embrace embracing instead the SUV. Our documentary investigates the death and resurrection of the electric car, as well as the role of renewable energy and sustainable living in our country's future; issues which affect everyone from progressive liberals to the neo-conservative right.

","The film deals with the history of the electric car, its modern development, and commercialization. The film focuses primarily on the General Motors EV1, which was made available for lease mainly in Southern California, after the California Air Resources Board (CARB) passed the Zero-emissions vehicle (ZEV) mandate in 1990 which required the seven major automobile suppliers in the United States to offer electric vehicles in order to continue sales of their gasoline powered vehicles in California. Nearly 5000 electric cars were designed and manufactured by GM, Toyota, Honda, Ford, Nissan, and Chrysler; and then later destroyed or donated to museums and educational institutions. Also discussed are the implications of the events depicted for air pollution, oil dependency, Middle East politics, and global warming.
The film details the California Air Resources Board's reversal of the mandate after relentless pressure and suits from automobile manufacturers, continual pressure from the oil industry, orchestrated hype over a future hydrogen car, and finally the George W. Bush administration.
A portion of the film details GM's efforts to demonstrate to California that there was no consumer demand for their product, and then to take back every EV1 and destroy them. A few were disabled and given to museums and universities, but almost all were found to have been crushed. GM never responded to the EV drivers' offer to pay the residual lease value ($1.9 million was offered for the remaining 78 cars in Burbank before they were crushed). Several activists, including actresses Alexandra Paul and Colette Divine, were arrested in the protest that attempted to block the GM car carriers taking the remaining EV1s off to be crushed.
The film explores some of the motives that may have pushed the auto and oil industries to kill off the electric car. Wally Rippel offers, for example, that the oil companies were afraid of losing their monopoly on transportation fuel over the coming decades; while the auto companies feared short term costs for EV development and long term revenue loss because EVs require little maintenance and no tuneups. Others explained the killing differently. GM spokesman Dave Barthmuss argued it was lack of consumer interest due to the maximum range of 80‚Äö√Ñ√¨100 miles per charge, and the relatively high price.
The film also showed the failed attempts by electric car enthusiasts trying to combat auto industry moves, and save the surviving vehicles. Towards the end of the film, a deactivated EV1 car #99 is found in the garage of Petersen Automotive Museum, with former EV sales representative, Chelsea Sexton, invited for a visit.
The film also explores the future of automobile technologies including a deeply critical look at hydrogen vehicles, an upbeat discussion of plug-in hybrids, and examples of other developing EV technologies such as the Tesla Roadster (released on the market two years after the film).",,2571.jpg,2009-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/who-stole-the-electric-car/id514504566?uo=4,,,,Comedy
1104,Wicker Park,"Intricately moving back and forth in time and revealing the story from each character's perspective, Wicker Park is an intense psychological drama about a man caught in an obsessive search for a woman he fell deeply in love with - a woman who then vanished without a trace. Two years after her disappearance, he catches a fleeting glimpse of her in a local bar and begins a twisting search to find her and discover what really happened.","Matt Simon, a young advertising executive, returns to Chicago with his fianc‚àö¬©e, Rebecca, after spending the last two years in New York. He bumps into his old friend Luke on the way into a meeting at Bellucci's, in preparation for a business trip to China. Once inside he thinks he overhears Lisa, the beautiful dancer he was in love with two years ago when she vanished overnight. He tries to catch her as she leaves but is brought up short by Rebecca, so he ducks out of the trip and embarks on an obsessive search for her, as the story of Matt and Lisa's romance unfolds in flashbacks.
The key card Lisa left at Bellucci's leads Matt to a hotel where he finds Lisa's silver compact and an article marked in the newspaper. He leaves a note for Lisa at Bellucci's, then asks Luke to borrow his car, promising to return it before nightfall. He trails the man from the newspaper article to an apartment, where he discovers a note to Lisa with her key enclosed under the door. The apartment is deserted but Matt leaves her a note himself, to meet him in Wicker Park, and keeps the key. By the time Matt returns the car he is ecstatic because he thinks he has found Lisa, but Luke is furious, because he had a date with a woman named Alex, who won't wait. When Alex calls, Matt takes all the blame and Luke is mollified.
The next day, after waiting in vain at Wicker Park, Matt goes back to the apartment where he is caught by a brunette woman who says that her name is Lisa. She says the apartment is hers, and she has a coat and red-soled shoes with a broken heel identical to Lisa's - shoes that came from Luke's shop, where Lisa first met Matt. She claims the man in the newspaper was stalking her, which is why she was at the hotel, and asks him to stay the night. They end up sleeping together but after she leaves for work he arranges to catch another flight to China and drops the key down a grate. Flashbacks reveal that she is actually Alex, Lisa's old neighbor and friend, and an aspiring actress. We learn that Alex saw Matt and fell in love with him, but before she found the courage to speak to him he fell in love with Lisa. She had told Lisa that she was interested in someone but never told her who he was, even after she realized Lisa had become involved with Matt. In truth, the man from the newspaper was stalking Lisa, and Alex agreed to swap apartments with her for a few days before Lisa leaves for a new job in London.
Luke persuades Matt to come with him that night to see Alex perform in A Midsummer Night's Dream, before he leaves for China. She is unrecognizable in stage makeup, but panics after she sees him in the audience with Luke, until Luke tells her Matt has left for China. But Matt retrieved the key from the grate earlier, and he goes back to the apartment where he spends the night. Alex sleeps at Luke's that night, and when Matt calls Luke she answers the phone, and drops it in a panic. She hears Luke say Matt is at the apartment, and runs out to catch him. After she leaves, Lisa calls. When Alex arrives at the apartment, Matt gives her another pair of red-soled shoes but they are too big. She realizes he suspects something, but Matt says he can exchange them and they go their separate ways.
Matt goes to say goodbye to Luke, but follows him into Bellucci's, where he finds Alex, and her deception is revealed. She admits she was in love with Matt, and wound up doing crazy things. Two years ago, the same day that Matt asked Lisa to move in with him, Lisa was offered a last minute job touring with a company in Europe and she had to jump on a plane. Lisa gave Alex a note to deliver to Matt, along with a key to his apartment, and when Alex arrived she tore up the note and deleted all the messages Lisa had left for him on his answering machine. He never learned why Lisa left, and Alex told Lisa that she'd seen Matt with another woman. Luke interrupts, telling Matt that Lisa called, and wants him to meet her at 3 at Wicker Park before she leaves for London. Matt heads to Wicker Park but he is too late. He races to the airport, where he bumps into Rebecca, who has come to pick him up from the business trip that he never went on.

3211,Wild Combination: A Portrait of Arthur Russell,"Wild Combination is director Matt Wolf's visually absorbing portrait of the seminal avant-garde composer, singer-songwriter, cellist, and disco producer Arthur Russell. Before his untimely death from AIDS in 1992, Arthur prolifically created music that spanned both pop and the transcendent possibilities of abstract art. Now, over fifteen years since his passing, Arthur's work is finally finding its audience. Wolf incorporates rare archival footage and commentary from Arthur's family, friends, and closest collaborators including Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg to tell this poignant and important story.

A portrait, mostly chronological, of composer, cellist, and vocalist Arthur Russell (1951-1992). His parents, friends and colleagues such as Allen Ginsberg and Philip Glass, his long-time companion Tom Lee, and others provide commentary. Arthur is shy, acne-scarred, from the prairie, constantly composing, and not always finishing works. After a few years in San Francisco, he settles in New York City and becomes music director at the Kitchen. He bridges pop and classical, records disco music with Lola Blank, has an unsuccessful collaboration with Robert Wilson, and is part of several bands. In archival clips, we see him perform. He leaves hundreds of tapes and other recordings.

","Wild Combination begins with interviews of Russell's parents discussing their youngest son's childhood. The film describes how Russell as a young boy is obsessed with Timothy Leary and insecure about his acne.[2] Leaving Iowa for San Francisco in the late sixties, he joins a Buddhist collective and befriends Allen Ginsburg. Russell decides to move to New York in the early seventies, where he starts working as the musical director of the Kitchen and becomes part of the downtown scene of artists, sharing an apartment building with Allen Ginsburg and Richard Hell. Russell engages in nearly every music scene the city has to offer: disco at David Mancuso's Loft, rock at CBGB, minimal composition at the Kitchen, and Allen Ginsberg's poetry recitations.[3] In 1978, Russell begins dating Tom Lee, whom he stays with until his AIDS-related death in 1992.
Other footage shows Russell later in life, ravaged by AIDS, but still able to play his cello and sing.[4] Russell eventually succumbs to dementia and throat cancer. The film ends with Emily Russell, Arthur's mother, speculating that had Arthur continued to live past forty, ""He would have made it, he would have gone far"".[5]","emotional,captivating,contemplative",3211.jpg,2008-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/wild-combination-portrait/id294680993?uo=4,uziDEMpJmAo,,,"Documentary,Musical & Performing Arts,Special Interest"

","A high school guidance counselor, Sam Lombardo, is accused of rape by two female students, Kelly Van Ryan and Suzie Toller, and hires lawyer Kenneth Bowden to defend him. At trial, Suzie admits that she and Kelly had made everything up to get revenge on Lombardo: Suzie for him failing to bail her out of jail on a minor drug charge and Kelly for him having an affair with her wealthy socialite mother, Sandra. Kelly's mother is humiliated by the scandal, and Lombardo and Bowden negotiate an $8.5 million settlement for defamation. However, is then revealed that Lombardo and the two girls had been working and sleeping together, and planned to split the money.
Police detective Ray Duquette tells both Kelly and Suzie that Lombardo transferred the money to an off-shore account. Suzie panics and goes to Kelly for help; Kelly assures Suzie that they can trust each other, but separately tells Lombardo over the phone that they may have to get rid of her. Suzie overhears this and attacks Kelly in the pool. Both girls fight, but eventually end up having sex in the pool, all witnessed by Duquette. However, a few nights later, Lombardo and Kelly take Suzie to the beach and seemingly kill her. After wrapping the body in plastic, they throw it in the trunk of the car and drive out to the swamp, where Lombardo disposes of it.
Duquette and his partner, Gloria, are called in to investigate Suzie's disappearance. Her blood and teeth are later found on the beach while her car is found at a bus terminal. After seeing his continued investigation, Duquette's superior insists that he drop the case. Regardless, Duquette goes to Kelly's house to confront her. When he arrives, Kelly tries to seduce him and then she appears to attack him, shooting him in the arm; Duquette is left with no choice but to kill her in self-defense. No charges are filed against Duquette, but he is dismissed from the force and loses his pension.
Later, it is revealed that Lombardo and Duquette had been working together the entire time. Although Lombardo is not pleased that Duquette killed Kelly instead of framing her as originally planned, Duquette insists that it leaves fewer loose ends. The two agree to go fishing on Lombardo's sailboat the following day. Once they are at sea, Lombardo knocks Duquette overboard. When Duquette climbs back aboard and attacks Lombardo, he is shot in the leg with a spear by the still-living Suzie. She shoots and kills Duquette as revenge for killing her friend, Davie, years before. Suzie then poisons Lombardo with a drink she poured for him and knocks him overboard, leaving him to drown.
It is then revealed that Suzie had planned the whole thing in order to get all the money and take revenge on both Lombardo and Duquette: Lombardo for leaving her in jail and Duquette for killing Davie. Suzie had discovered that Lombardo and Kelly were sleeping together, and used it to her advantage. As for Kelly's death, she had not attacked Duquette as he had claimed. In reality, when she tried to escape the guest house when he entered, he punched her to incapacitate her then broke into the gun case and shot her twice with his gun. He then used her hand to shoot himself in the shoulder. Bowden meets with Suzie and tells her how the money had been divided. She kisses him on the cheek and as she walks off, Bowden tells her to ""be good"".","sexual,suspenseful,trust,tense,fear",2315.jpg,1998-03-20, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/wild-things/id270235680?uo=4,m9gWo4lLSEU,,,"Comedy,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"

","In 1876, Lin McAdam (James Stewart) and friend 'High-Spade' Frankie Wilson (Millard Mitchell) pursue outlaw 'Dutch Henry' Brown (Stephen McNally) into Dodge City, Kansas. They arrive just in time to see a man forcing a saloon-hall girl named Lola (Shelley Winters) onto the stage leaving town. Once the man reveals himself to be Sheriff Wyatt Earp (Will Geer) Lin backs down. Earp informs the two men that firearms are not allowed in town and they must check them in with Earp's brother Virgil. Lin and Dutch Henry see each other in the saloon, but are unable to fight due to the presence of Earp. Lin enters a shooting competition, contending against Dutch Henry among others, that is held on the Fourth of July. They end up the two finalists for a prized one-of-one-thousand perfect Winchester rifle. Lin wins by betting that he can shoot through a stamp placed over the hole of round piece from an Indian necklace and then doing it. Dutch Henry claims that he is leaving town, but then goes to Lin's boarding house room and jumps Lin when he enters and steals the prize. He and his two cohorts leave town with Lin and High-Spade in hot pursuit.
Dutch Henry and his two men ride to Riker's Bar. Because they left town in a hurry, they left their guns behind which puts them in a very bad position considering the problems with Indians in the area. Once Indian trader Joe Lamont (John McIntire) gets a look at the rifle, he raises the price of his guns high enough that Dutch and his men can not afford to buy any. Dutch's only option is to trade the rifle for three hundred dollars in gold and their choice of weapons from the pile that Lamont is going to sell to the Indians. Lamont feigns inexperience at cards and Dutch attempts to win back the rifle. Instead, he ends up losing the three hundred in gold to Lamont. Lamont takes his guns to meet his Indian buyers, but their leader Young Bull (Rock Hudson) doesn't like the old, worn-out merchandise Lamont is offering; he wants the guns that Crazy Horse used at the Battle of the Little Bighorn. Lamont made the mistake of leaving his rifle very visible and Hudson's character wants it. When Lamont refuses to sell, he is robbed and scalped.


Shelley Winters and James Stewart
Lola Manners (Shelley Winters) and her fiance Steve Miller (Charles Drake) are in a wagon heading to where their new home will be. The left rear wheel of the wagon is squeaking loudly because Steve forgot to grease it back in town. When they are pursued by Indians, the wheel becomes a factor because the wagon is slowed down. In a moment of panic, which Lola never forgives him for, he gets off the wagon and gets on his horse that is tied to the back. He rides away and leaves Lola, but returns when he sees a small encampment of soldiers up ahead. He rides alongside while Lola drives the wagon and they reach safety with the Army.
That night, after being chased by the Indians, Lin and High-Spade meet up with those same soldiers which has been pinned down by those Indians. The soldiers are young and inexperienced and their crusty old sergeant (Jay C. Flippen) is inexperienced in fighting Indians. Lin gives him some tactical advice on how to fight the Indians. They prepare themselves for an early attack the next day and Lin gives Lola his six-gun to fight with. The unspoken message he gives her, which she fully understands, is that she is to use the gun on herself to avoid capture.


James Stewart
After a fierce morning battle, the Indian leader is killed. Lin and 'High-Spade' return to their search for Dutch Henry and they ride right past the rifle lying on the ground by the dead Indian's body. It is found by Doan (Tony Curtis) and the sergeant gives it to Steve (to avoid having an officer take it away from Doan).
Steve and Lola reach the Jameson house where Lola will stay with Mrs. Jameson and her two small children while Steve goes to meet 'Waco' Johnnie Dean, much to the disapproval of Lola. Steve ends up not having to go because Waco (Dan Duryea) and his men show up at the Jameson house unexpectedly. They are on the run from a posse and once Waco sees the rifle, he covets it. He keeps insulting Miller in front of Lola in an attempt to provoke Steve into a gunfight. Finally Steve draws on Waco, though he knows he is no match for the professional. Waco kills him and takes possession of the rifle. Once Waco and Lola escape the posse and go to Dutch's hideout, Dutch Henry takes back ""his"" rifle.
There, Dutch Henry plans an armed robbery in Tascosa, Texas. Waco is stationed in a saloon to provide cover for the gang's escape after the robbery, but is betrayed to Lin by Lola. Lin forces Waco to tell him where Dutch is and when Waco gets a chance to shoot Lin, Lin kills him in the street. The robbery goes awry and Lin chases Dutch Henry out of town and confronts him on a rocky hill. Lin refers to Dutch by his real name, Matthew. They shoot it out on the hill with rifles before Lin finally shoots Matthew/Dutch Henry off the hill. High-Spade reveals to Lola that Dutch Henry is Lin's no-good brother. Matthew robbed a bank and ran home to hide out. When their father wouldn't help him, Matthew shot him in the back. Lin comes riding back into town with his rifle and it's obvious that he and Lola will be together.",,1416.jpg,1950-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/winchester-73/id511264531?uo=4,vCu1RKphgos,60027752,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Winchester_73/60027752,"Classics,Western"

3322,Winnebago Man,"The true story of one of the funniest videos of all time. A young filmmaker goes in search of the legendary Winnebago Man, and discovers the YouTube star living alone on top of a mountain, as sharp-tongued as ever, but more intelligent and lovable than anyone could have imagined. An outrageously funny and unexpectedly redemptive tale of one man‚Äö√Ñ√¥s response to unintended celebrity.

In 1988, a man named Jack Rebney spent time with a camera crew making a promotional video to be used as a sales tool for recreational vehicles. To say Rebney was having a frustrating time would be something of an understatement; unable to remember much of the sales pitch he'd written and showing little patience as he dealt with bugs, hot weather, and uncooperative equipment, Rebney spoiled take after take, swearing a blue streak as one thing or another went wrong. The editors of the video created a gag reel in which Rebney's colorful bursts of anger were strung together for comic effect, and the footage circulated on dubbed videotapes until 2005. That year, someone posted Rebney's tirade online, and before long ""Winnebago Man"" became an Internet sensation, with the video racking up countless views and inspiring a number of parodies and on-line tributes. But who was Jack Rebney, why was he in such a lousy mood, and is he aware of his underground fame today? Filmmaker Ben Steinbauer decided to find out, and his search to locate Rebney and uncover the true story behind his moment of Internet infamy is chronicled in the documentary Winnebago Man. The film received its world premiere at the 2009 South by Southwest Film Festival. ~ Mark Deming, Rovi
","The documentary starts with Steinbauer's obsession with a widely circulated viral video featuring outtakes from an RV commercial shoot, centered around a cantankerous pitchman who regularly becomes outraged and flustered, cursing in colorful mannerisms. Steinbauer researches the video, and discovers that it had been circulating on VHS long before it appeared on the Internet.
With the help of a private detective, Steinbauer ultimately tracks down the infamous ""Winnebago Man"": Jack Rebney. Steinbauer visits Rebney at his home in a remote mountain area in California. Steinbauer is surprised to find Rebney to be calm, congenial, and articulate ‚Äö√Ñ√Æ in contrast to the angry, profane man on the famous video. Rebney claims to be indifferent about the video and its popularity on the Internet. Steinbauer returns home disappointed.
But soon, Rebney begins contacting Steinbauer, and admits that he had not been candid in their first encounter. He reveals that he has long been angry about the video and its notoriety because he does not want to be remembered that way. Steinbauer learns that Rebney was once a news broadcaster who left the industry embittered by the decline in real news and the rise of opinion-based news and punditry; additionally, Rebney reveals that he now has strong political opinions that he wants to share. Rebney invites Steinbauer for a second visit, but before this takes place, local papers report that Rebney had gone missing for a time while taking a walk. When Steinbauer makes his second visit to Rebney's home, a now openly cantankerous Rebney explains that he is now blind.
Rebney gives a series of often profane, but articulate, interviews to Steinbauer. He refuses to discuss personal matters, but instead wants to make political speeches about subjects that make him angry, such as Dick Cheney and Walmart. Eventually, Steinbauer convinces Rebney to attend the Found Footage Festival in San Francisco. There, fans have lined up for a sold-out screening of the original video featuring Rebney. The fans describe Rebney's positive impact on them. During the screening, the Festival organizers invite Rebney onstage as a special guest, where he wittily engages the audience. After the screening, Rebney meets several fans who request autographs and express to him how viewing the old footage cheers them up after a hard day.
Later that night, Rebney muses to an old friend that his fans are more intelligent than he anticipated. The next day, the filmmakers and Rebney's friend drive him back home. There, Rebney's friend tells him, ""You made a lot of people happy this weekend."" Rebney replies by acknowledging that he takes some small degree of pride in how, for many people, he represents the human condition in the face of adversity.",,3322.jpg,2010-07-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/winnebago-man/id399850688?uo=4,LtCRVUdaiyw,,,"Comedy,Documentary,Special Interest"

","The film is based on three stories found in the Milne books. Two stories are from Winnie-the-Pooh: ""In Which Eeyore Loses a Tail and Pooh Finds One"" and ""In Which Piglet Meets a Heffalump"". The other story is found in The House at Pooh Corner: ""In Which Rabbit Has a Busy Day and We Learn What Christopher Robin Does in the Mornings"". Some elements, such as the gang thinking that Christopher Robin has been captured by a monster, are based on events from the film Pooh's Grand Adventure: The Search for Christopher Robin.
Pooh wakes up one day to find that he is out of honey. While out searching for more, Pooh discovers that Eeyore has lost his tail. Pooh, Tigger, Rabbit, Owl, Kanga, and Roo come to the rescue, and Christopher Robin decides to hold a contest to see who can find a replacement for Eeyore's tail. The prize for the winner is a fresh pot of honey. After many failed attempts for what would replace Eeyore's tail (such as a cuckoo clock), Kanga suggests they use a scarf, but it unravels.
The next day, Pooh goes to visit Christopher Robin and he finds a note that says ""Gon Out Bizy Back Soon"". Because Pooh is unable to read the note, he asks for Owl's help. Owl's poor reading comprehension skills lead Pooh and his friends to believe that Christopher Robin has been abducted by a ruthless and mischievous monster they call the ""Backson"". Rabbit plans to trap the Backson in a pit, which they think he'll fall into after following a trail of items leading to it. Meanwhile, Tigger, wanting a sidekick to help him defeat the Backson, recruits Eeyore to be a second Tigger. He dresses up like the Backson and tries to teach Eeyore how to fight. Eeyore, who is doing this against his will, escapes from Tigger and hides underwater.
After a failed attempt to get honey from a bee hive, Pooh's imagination combined with his hunger get the better of him, and accidentally falls into the pit meant for the Backson. Rabbit, Kanga, Roo, Owl and Eeyore (who had found an anchor whilst he was hiding to replace his own tail) try to get him out, but fall in themselves. Piglet attempts to get Pooh and friends out of the trap (though continuously irritating Rabbit with overintrepretations of his instructions who is even more miffed on realisation that Owl would have gotten them out), but he runs into Tigger, still in his Backson outfit, and mistakes him for the actual monster. Piglet escapes from Tigger on a red balloon, which knocks some of the storybook's letters into the pit. After the chase, Tigger and Piglet fall into the trap as well, where Eeyore reminds Tigger that he, being ""the only one"", is ""the most wonderful thing about Tiggers"". Eventually, Pooh figures out to use the fallen letters to form a ladder, and the animals are able to escape the pit. They soon find Christopher Robin, and tell him about the Backson, but he clarifies, saying he meant to be ""back soon"".
Later, Pooh visits Owl only to find that Owl was the one that took Eeyore's tail, not realizing it belonged to Eeyore. Owl had been using Eeyore's tail as a bell pulley for his door. Pooh chooses to leave and return the tail to Eeyore instead of sharing a pot of honey with Owl. Christopher Robin is proud of Pooh's kindness and rewards him with a large pot of honey.
In a post-credits scene, it is revealed that the rumored Backson actually exists deep in the woods, but is much friendlier than imagined. He discovers the trail of objects that the animals left, and picks up each one, planning to return them to whoever owns them. He ends up falling into the pit that was originally meant for him and waits for someone to arrive and help him out. He adds, ""I sure hope that fellow will be back soon"".",joy,173.jpg,2011-04-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/winnie-the-pooh-2011/id446016458?uo=4,hRT86ZggCEk,70178626,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Winnie_the_Pooh/70178626,"Animation,Kids & Family"

","Seventeen-year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) looks after her mentally ill mother, her twelve-year-old brother Sonny and her six-year-old sister Ashlee. Every day, Ree makes sure her siblings eat, while teaching them basic survival skills like hunting and cooking. The family is very poor. Ree's father, Jessup, has not been home for a long time and his whereabouts are unknown. He is out on bail following an arrest for manufacturing methamphetamine.
The sheriff tells Ree that if her father does not show up for his court date, they will lose the house because it was put up as part of his bond. Ree sets out to find her father, following his trail into a world where meth use is common, violence is frequent, women are scared of their men, and people are bound by codes of loyalty and secrecy. She starts with her meth-addicted uncle Teardrop (John Hawkes) and continues on to more distant kin, eventually trying to talk to the local crime boss, Thump Milton. Milton refuses to see her; the only information Ree comes up with are warnings to leave the situation alone and stories that Jessup died in a meth lab fire or skipped town to avoid the trial.
When Jessup fails to appear for the trial, the bondsman comes looking for him and tells Ree that she will have about a week before the house and land are seized. Ree tells him that Jessup must be dead, because ""Dollys don't run."" He tells her that she will need to provide proof that her father is dead in order to avoid the bond's being forfeited.
Ree tries to go to see Milton again and is severely beaten by his women. Teardrop shows up and rescues Ree, promising her attackers that she will not say anything or cause any more trouble. Teardrop tells Ree that her father was killed because he was going to inform on other meth cookers, but he does not know who killed him; he warns her that if she ever finds out who did that she must not tell him because he would kill that person.
A few nights later, the same three Milton women who beat Ree come to her house. They offer to take her to see ""her daddy's bones"". The women place a burlap sack on her head and drive her to a pond, where they get into a rowboat and row to the shallow place where her father's submerged body lies. They tell Ree to reach into the freezing water and grasp her father's hands so they can cut them off with a chainsaw; the severed, decaying arms will serve as proof of death for the authorities. Ree takes the hands to the sheriff, telling him that someone flung them onto the porch of her house.
The bondsman comes back to the house and gives Ree the cash portion of the bond, which was put up by an anonymous associate of Jessup. Ree tries to give Jessup's banjo to Teardrop, but he tells her to keep it at the house for him. As he is leaving, he tells her that he now knows who killed her father.

1232,Withnail and I,"London 1969 - two 'resting' (unemployed and unemployable) actors, Withnail and Marwood, fed up with damp, cold, piles of washing-up, mad drug dealers and psychotic Irishmen, decide to leave their squalid Camden flat for an idyllic holiday in the countryside, courtesy of Withnail's uncle Monty's country cottage. But when they get there, it rains non-stop, there's no food, and their basic survival skills turn out to be somewhat limited. Matters are not helped by the arrival of Uncle Monty, who shows an uncomfortably keen interest in Marwood.

","The film depicts the lives and misadventures of two ""resting"" (struggling and unemployed) young actor friends in 1969 London. They are the flamboyant alcoholic Withnail and ""I"" (named ""Marwood"" in the published screenplay but not in the credits) as his more level-headed, anxiety-prone friend and the film's narrator. Withnail is filled with indignation over life's injustices, despite his privileged background. He rages against the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune all the more because he blames others for the adverse consequences of his exuberant arrogance and habitual lying. Withnail sets the tone for the friendship, with Marwood going along with whatever Withnail wants to do. They live in a filthy Georgian flat in Camden Town. While they wait for a part, daily life revolves around getting coins to use in the meters that provide gas or electricity, going to collect benefits, and waiting for the pubs to open so they can drink and be somewhere with heating.
The film begins with Marwood smoking in the darkened flat. When he has finished he goes to a caf‚àö¬© and reads disturbing articles in a newspaper. Needing a change of scene, Withnail and Marwood decide to take a recuperative holiday in the countryside. Withnail secures the loan of the country cottage belonging to his eccentric, gay uncle, Monty. Monty is an old boy of Harrow School, and it is suggested that Withnail is one too. Monty is told that Marwood went to ""the other place"". Monty is an aesthete, nostalgic for a by-gone age of beauty and poetic friendship among young men, and, fancying himself an actor, is fond of quoting Charles Baudelaire and reciting passages from Hamlet. His only companion in the large luxurious Chelsea house in which he resides is a pet cat with which he is seen constantly arguing.
Withnail and Marwood get into Marwood's battered Jaguar Mark 2, which is parked next to a scene of demolition of some old houses (significant for the time period) and set off north along the motorway. The holiday doesn't quite go according to plan: although the countryside is beautiful, the weather is cold and often inclement, the cottage is run-down and dusty, they have little food or supplies and the locals are surly and unwelcoming ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ in particular a threatening poacher, Jake, whom Withnail offends. Then an intruder breaks into the cottage in the middle of the night. Withnail and Marwood are terrified, believing that the intruder is Jake. Comically, the intruder turns out to be Monty, who has been stranded for ""an aeon"" with a punctured tyre. They greet Monty with mixed emotions. Monty brings them ample supplies of food and wine, but it soon becomes clear that ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ having been falsely told by Withnail that Marwood is gay ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ he has designs on Marwood and will not be deterred by politeness. In a farcical scene of bedroom-switching, Monty eventually corners Marwood, bursting into his room and proclaiming his desire to ""have [him] even if it must be burglary."" Terrified, Marwood manages to stave off Monty's overtures with the excuse that he has a permanent relationship with Withnail that he is afraid to reveal. Monty, who believes in love and loyalty, accepts this excuse as the whole truth and apologises for coming between them. Rebuffed, Monty leaves the cottage in the night for London. The next morning, Marwood finds Monty's gracious note of apology and reads it aloud, feeling sympathy for him. Withnail, who is eagerly drinking Monty's fine wine, takes no responsibility for the chaos he has caused, and Marwood begins to distance himself from his friend. Marwood receives a telegram that confirms that he has an audition for a part, and he insists that they go back to London immediately.
After Withnail (who has no driving license and is still drunk) tries to ""make time"" by driving the car while Marwood sleeps, and swerving all over the road, they encounter a police van and eventually pull over for it. Withnail is arrested for driving while intoxicated, and attempting to give them someone else's urine sample from a Fairy Liquid bottle attached by a tube to his penis. The pair return to the flat, to find a man lying in their bath. Danny, who is squatting at the flat, opines that the oncoming end of the 1960s is the end of the ""greatest decade in the history of mankind"" and that ""there are going to be a lot of refugees."" The three, and Danny's friend Presuming Ed (the man in the bath), get high smoking a ""Camberwell carrot"" (cannabis joint). Marwood calls his agent and discovers that the production company now want him to play the lead part in the play. He gets his curly hair cut short, packs his bags, and prepares to leave for the station for what he hopes is a new and more mature phase of his life. He wants to leave by himself, but Withnail insists upon accompanying him at least part of the way, while drinking from a bottle of Monty's wine; ""'53 Margaux, best of the century.""
Marwood leaves Withnail in the rain in Regent's Park. There, for the first time, Withnail sincerely reveals himself, declaiming ""What a piece of work is a man!"" from Act 2 Scene ii of Hamlet to an uncomprehending pack of wolves behind a fence in the adjoining London Zoo.[3] Then, the camera remains still as he turns and walks further and further away into the distance, swinging the bottle, as the credits start to roll.",,1232.jpg,1987-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/withnail-and-i/id381353170?uo=4,i7Ug8ia2avg,60020699,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Withnail_and_I/60020699,"Comedy,Drama"

1777,Workingman's Death,"Today's manual laborers are no longer celebrated with hymns of praise. They must be content with encouraging one another that backbreaking work is better than no work at all... In the Ukraine, a group of men spend long days crawling through cramped shafts of illegal coal mines. Sulfur gatherers in Indonesia brave the smoky heat of an active volcano and the treacherous trip back down. Blood, fire and stench are routine for workers at a crowded open-air slaughterhouse in Nigeria. Pakistani men use little more than their bare hands to dismantle an abandoned oil tanker for scrap metal. Steelworkers in China fear they could be a dying breed... Five portraits of heavy manual labor, increasingly less visible in our technological 21st Century.","In this film showcasing six of the most dangerous jobs on the planet, Mega Cities director Michael Glawogger travels the globe to turn his lens on the men who labor in these deadly but necessary jobs day after grueling day. Structured in six chapters that take the viewer everywhere from the Ukraine, where workers snake down a 16-inch tall mineshaft to collect coal, to Pakistan, where migrants disassemble oil tankers piece-by-piece with their bare hands, Glawogger's film focuses on the ravages of manual labor on the human body and the determination of the men who endure these tasks to build a better future for their children and families.

Lance Clayton is a man who has learned to settle. He dreamed of being a rich and famous writer, but has only managed to make it as a high school poetry teacher. His only son Kyle is an insufferable jackass who won't give his father the time of day. Lance is dating Claire, the school's adorable art teacher, but she doesn't want to get serious -- or even acknowledge publicly that they are dating. Then, in the wake of a freak accident, Lance suffers the worst tragedy and greatest opportunity of his life. He is suddenly faced with the possibility of all the fame, fortune and popularity he ever dreamed of, if he can only live with the knowledge of how he got there.

","Lance Clayton (Robin Williams) is a single father, unpublished author, and high-school English teacher who dreams of becoming a famous writer. He narrates that he will quit writing if his next book fails and that he is scared of being alone. He unsuccessfully tries to bond with his 15 year old underachieving, manipulative, hostile, sex-obsessed teenage son Kyle (Sabara).[4] Kyle is a student at the school where Lance teaches an unpopular poetry class. His only friend is Andrew, a fellow student who spends his evenings at the Claytons' house trying to avoid his embarrassing alcoholic mother. He is respectful and starkly different from Kyle. Kyle's consistently poor academic performance and vile behavior gain the attention of the school principal, who advises Lance that Kyle should transfer to a special-needs school. Lance meanwhile is in a noncommital relationship with a fellow teacher named Claire, who is spending time with a fellow teacher named Mike who runs a more successful class than Lance. On nights when Claire cancels their dates and he is all alone, Lance bonds with his elderly neighbor.
One night, after Kyle and Lance spend an evening with Claire, Lance discovers in horror that Kyle has accidentally strangled himself in an autoerotic asphyxiation accident in his bedroom, looking at a picture of Claire's underwear that he sneaked under the table with his cell phone that night. To avoid embarrassing his son and himself, he stages Kyle‚Äö√Ñ√¥s death as an intentional suicide. He writes a suicide note on Kyle‚Äö√Ñ√¥s computer and hangs his son‚Äö√Ñ√¥s body in the closet. Initially, most of the students and faculty at Lance's school are uninterested in Kyle's death, Kyle having been a very unpopular and unlikeable person. However, a classmate later obtains the suicide note from police records and publishes it in the school newspaper. The note strikes a chord with the students and faculty, and suddenly many students claim to have been friends with Kyle and are touched by how deep and intelligent he shows himself to be in his writings.
Enjoying the attention his writing is finally receiving, Lance decides to write and publish a phony journal that was supposedly written by his son before his suicide. Kyle becomes something of a post-mortem cult phenomenon at the school, and soon Lance begins to receive the attention and adoration that he had always desired. He begins spending more time with Claire, his class becomes more popular, and students treat him as a friend. Andrew finds Kyle‚Äö√Ñ√¥s suicide note and journals as highly uncharacteristic based on Kyle's personality when he was alive, but Lance brushes him off when Andrew confronts him. The journal soon attracts the attention of book publishers and Lance lands a television appearance on a nationally broadcast talk show. The school principal then decides to rename the school library in Kyle‚Äö√Ñ√¥s honor, despite Kyle's attitude at school during his lifetime and the fact that the principal had at one point suggested that Kyle be transferred. Lance's work, though published under false pretenses, earns him all the fame and appreciation he has dreamed of.
At the library dedication, pressed by a combination of his guilt over exploiting his son‚Äö√Ñ√¥s death, his mounting hatred for the hypocrites who claimed false friendship, and the faculty‚Äö√Ñ√¥s new-found admiration of the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫genius‚Äö√Ñ√π of his dead son, Lance confesses before the school. He declares none of them liked Kyle, but that he loved his son, even though he was unpleasant and unintelligent, and that Lance wrote his suicide note and journal to cover up his son's accidental death. Claire slaps Lance and approaches Mike, the principal and students glare and sneer at him, but Lance feels reborn having realized that being alone is not the worst thing. Lance becomes the new social pariah and is hated by everyone, but Andrew tells him he knew Lance wrote the journal and that he enjoyed it and feels Lance should keep writing.",,2926.jpg,2009-04-25, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/worlds-greatest-dad/id345326372?uo=4,"5PkGTjZccNE,v=5PkGTjZccNE&hd=1",70112475,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/World_s_Greatest_Dad/70112475,"Comedy,Drama"

366,Wyatt Earp,"Kevin Costner plays the most famous lawman ever to stride the Wild West. In a gritty, complex portrayal hailed as a ""classic American performance"" (Bob Campbell, Newhouse Newspapers), Academy Award winner Costner (Dances with Wolves, The Bodyguard) plays the man who became a myth in acclaimed director Lawrence Kasdan's (The Big Chill, Silverado) epic, action-filled saga. Gene Hackman, an Oscar winner for Unforgiven, as Wyatt's iron-willed father, and Dennis Quaid (The Big Easy, The Right Stuff) as Earp's deadly best friend Doc Holliday add power to this mammoth, hard-hitting Western. From Wichita to Dodge City to the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona, Wyatt Earp is a thrilling journey of romance, adventure and desperate, heroic action.","Wyatt Earp sits in a saloon, presumably just before the Gunfight at the OK Corral, receiving information from his brother, Virgil, that the Clantons and the McLaurys are armed and waiting for them. Wyatt Earp says ""let's go"", as we assume he is now off to do his duty, as he meets his date-with-destiny gunfight...DISSOLVE into the past, as a teenager living on the family farm. His older brothers, Virgil and James, are away at war serving with the Union Army. Wyatt dreams of war, and packs some belongings, bids his younger brothers & sisters goodbye, and attempts to run away, intending to lie about his age and join the Union Army. He doesn't make it off the farm before his father catches him and forces him to return home. A short while later, both brothers return home at the war's end, with James gravely wounded. Shortly afterwards, the family moves west. It is during this move that Wyatt first sees a man killed, shot during a gunfight. He gets sick at the sight, and vomits.
Years pass, finding him working out west as a wagon driver. During his time there, he works also as a referee for fights, and finds himself at odds with a bully. Wyatt and the bully eventually come to the point of fighting, with the bully intending to shoot Wyatt. Wyatt disarms him by throwing a billiard ball at him, and striking the bully in the throat, thereby rendering him harmless. In an extremely poignant and telling moment, Wyatt proclaims that ""this man was going to shoot me down...over NOTHIN'!!"". He then takes his gun as a trophy.
Returning home to Missouri, Wyatt marries a childhood sweetheart, Urilla Sutherland (Annabeth Gish). The two move into their own house, and he begins working as a policeman. Months later, while pregnant, his wife dies from Typhoid fever. He stays by her side throughout the illness, becoming deeply depressed afterward. He burns their home and all they own, begins drinking, and drifting from town to town, eventually landing in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. He robs a man and steals his horse, but is captured a short time later. With Wyatt facing certain hanging, his father bails him out of jail, telling him to leave and never return to Arkansas.
He begins working as a buffalo hunter, where he meets Bat Masterson and his brother Ed Masterson. The three become friends and work together hunting buffalo, with the two brothers working as Wyatt's skinners. Years pass, and he begins working as a Deputy Marshal in Wichita, Kansas, and builds a reputation as a good lawman. He is recruited to work as a deputy in Dodge City, with a lower salary, but for extra money for each arrest made, in the end making more than he would have in Wichita. In Dodge City he builds a hard reputation, and he kills his first man, a shooting witnessed by actress Josie Marcus. Wyatt becomes involved romantically with a prostitute, Mattie Blaylock, and the Mastersons begin working with him as deputies. Wyatt disagrees with Ed Masterson working as a lawman, believing him to be too passive. The Dodge City council decides that Ed is more acceptable than Wyatt due to the latter's excessive force, and fires him, appointing Ed to take his place. Wyatt then begins working for the railroad, capturing outlaws.
While pursuing outlaw Dave Rudabaugh, he is introduced to gunman and gambler Doc Holliday, in Fort Griffin, Texas, and the two become friends. Holliday assists Earp in locating Rudabaugh, whom he dislikes tremendously. Shortly afterward, Wyatt receives word that Ed Masterson has been killed, having shot and killed both his assailants before dying in the street. Wyatt returns to Dodge City to help bring law and order. After working there for a while, he and his family move to Tombstone, Arizona, under the protest of the Earp wives, and Mattie. Wyatt immediately finds himself at odds with the ""Cowboy"" gang. He meets and becomes romantically involved with Marcus, which puts him at odds with her boyfriend, Sheriff Behan. This relationship also causes stress in his relationship with Mattie, and becomes the subject of rumor about town.
Wyatt and his brothers Morgan and Virgil arrest several Cowboys, and Virgil takes over as marshal following the murder of town marshal Fred White. The brothers find themselves at odds with the Cowboys often, and tension builds. Wyatt breaks up several altercations involving the Cowboys, particularly Ike Clanton (Jeff Fahey), and Doc Holliday swears his loyalty to Wyatt, whom he considers his only real friend. Eventually the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral occurs, with the brothers becoming very unpopular in town. Virgil is ambushed and wounded, and Morgan is killed. The film then shows only a glimpse of the Vendetta Ride with Wyatt and his friends taking out revenge on the remaining ""Cowboys"", and then skips to many years later with him and Josie mining for gold in Alaska. While en route by boat, a young man on the same boat recognizes Wyatt, and recounts a story in which Wyatt had saved the boy's uncle, ""Tommy Behind-The-Deuce"". The film ends with Wyatt saying to Josie, ""Some people say it didn't happen that way"", to which she responds ""Never mind them, Wyatt. It happened that way.""","rough,captivating",366.jpg,1994-06-24, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/wyatt-earp/id278424599?uo=4,BS5n_Ql1v2k,60011597,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Wyatt_Earp/60011597,"Action & Adventure,Drama,Western"

","A stuttering franchise finds its mojo, a la Austin Powers, in the 1960s. Bond-esque cool, a hot cast (Fassbender, Lawrence) and smart retconning of history make this the summer's most stylish movie.

With characters emphasised over Action & Adventure set-pieces, this brought a relatively low return on investment for Marvel. Expect more pyrotechnics in the prequel-sequel. Kevin Bacon as a mutant Nazi! Rose Byrne in her pants! Nicolas Hoult done up like Sully from Monsters, Inc! And these aren't even the best things about Matthew Vaughn's vibrant, sprawling, ensemble origin story (well, maybe the Bacon bits...). 

A franchise reboot reminiscent of JJ Abrams' 2009 Star Trek overhaul, this is the fifth film in the X-Men canon and even if it can't quite match Bryan Singer's X2 (among the finest of its kind), First Class is still fast, fresh and fun. 

It's intelligent and emotionally resonant, explosive and eye-dazzling. Factor in a zeitgeisty, hot-list cast and First Class is likely to be one of the summer's best biggies. It sure as hell razes Brett Ratner's disappointing X-Men: The Last Stand (which Vaughn was slated for at one point) and Gavin Hood's time-waster Wolverine.

Poland, 1944: a young Erik Lehnsherr is separated from his parents in a concentration camp; meanwhile, in an affluent but isolated stately home in New York a young Charles Xavier happens upon a strange blue little girl who's able to disguise herself as other people. 

Eighteen years later, Erik (Michael Fassbender) and Charles (James McAvoy) have matured into powerful, charismatic men with opposing agendas. 

Their paths cross in the pursuit of former Nazi Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), a ruthless mutant supremacist plotting to use the Cuban Missile crisis to provoke a war among humans. 

Extensive globe-trotting (Argentina, Russia, America, Switzerland, Poland, the UK) in a Cold War context lend this the feel of a '60s espionager. 

But at heart First Class is the story of how close friends become bitter enemies and of how Charles and Erik become Professor X and Magneto.

Heard this one before? Whether it's Clark Kent and Lex Luther or Peter Parker and Harry Osborn, the 'frenemies' angle is a well-worn superhero staple. But strong, sympathetic performances and bromantic chemistry between dashing, dangerous Erik and compassionate humanist Charles inject fresh heft. 

An early scene sees Erik in an Argentinian bar toasting then torturing two Nazi associates of Shaw with a single-minded menace reminiscent of Inglourious Basterds' opener. 

Yet the sequence occurs before he's ever met Charles, and the possibility of redemption that this relationship brings is all the more affecting when played to its conclusion. 

Dramatic irony works less in the favour of the Cold War plot, yet the stylish production design - the sleazy, sexy Hellfire Club, the yachts, submarines and covert military bases conjure a James Bond glamour.

Meanwhile, the sea battle that crescendos the Action & Adventure doesn't fail to thrill. 

As for the supporting cast... it looks like the Six Degrees Of Kevin Bacon game just got a whole lot easier. Jennifer Lawrence (Oscar-nommed, just snagged the lead in The Hunger Games) brings vulnerability and Winter's Bone stoicism to shape-shifting future-Mystique, Raven, while Nicholas Hoult (BAFTA-nommed, the lead in Singer's next film Jack The Giant Killer) adds sensitivity then rage to brainbox-turned-Beast Hank.

Caleb Landry Jones (stand-out in The Last Exorcism) supplies humour as gobby baby-Banshee Sean Cassidy, and Zo‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö√´‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚àö¬¥‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö‚Ä†‚àö‚àÇ¬¨¬®‚Äö√Ñ¬¢‚Äö√Ñ√∂‚àö√ë‚àö‚àÇ‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√Ñ‚Ä†‚Äö√†√∂‚Äö√†√á¬¨¬®¬¨¬Æ¬¨¬®¬¨¬¢ Kravitz (daughter of Lenny, star of festival hit Yelling At The Sky) gives the winged Angel Salvadore a hard-faced worldliness. 

Her intro is a highlight too, with a pissed-up Erik and Charles checking her out in a strip joint.

Strangely, it's the mutant enemies who feel underplayed. 

Vaughn regular Jason Flemyng's devilish Azazel, weather-bothering Riptide (Alex Gonzalez) and even Mad Men sizzler January Jones as icy Emma Frost are denied a backstory - and in the case of Flemyng and Gonzalez any real dialogue. 

Thank God for scene-stealing, scheming, chocolate-munching, sociopath Shaw. Bacon makes effortless a larger-than-life role that evolves from guffawing Nazi sadist to slick Bondian baddie.

There's a lot of ground to cover to give the gang a chance to stretch their legs (wings, feet, etc), but fortunately Jane Goldman's tight script and Vaughn's zip and pacing (abundant in his brilliant anti-superhero Kick-Ass, where he also teamed with Goldman) mean the balance between big set-pieces and character business is deftly held. 

If First Class doesn't quite achieve the anarchy and irreverence of Kick-Ass it's partly because this is a different beast - not lacking in charm and wit, but occasionally in danger of veering towards broader laughs. 

This isn't one for tots, though - carrying the same 12A rating as The Dark Knight, it mirrors Christopher Nolan's unwillingness to shy away from scenes of cruelty too bleak for infants.

""Mutant and proud!"" asserts a naked, blue Jennifer Lawrence, in the closest X-Men: First Class gets to a catchphrase. She could be talking about Vaughn's film, which takes DNA from Singer (back in the fold as producer) and Marvel and mixes it with Bond and Batman, bromance and coming-of-age angst to create a cool, character-driven Action & Adventureer with a social conscience that's something to be proud of. Top class.
 
A classy addition to the X-series that expertly establishes a hoard of characters, navigates a Cold War plot and squeezes a tear for a friendship failed. Dream-team casting and quality FX make this the summer blockbuster to beat.

Though, it seemed that after that, Scott had disappeared. Meanwhille, the rift between humans and mutants had finally reached the boiling point. When humans discovered what causes humans to mutate, they have found a cure for the mutation. The X-Men were appalled at this idea. It was not long at all until the news about the cure came to Magneto. He decides to organize an army of mutants and wage his war against the humans. Then, it became clear that Jean Gray evolved into the Pheonix, her new mutant powers are so strong that she can not control her own body. Then, she kills off Professor X with her new powers.

","Twenty years before the movie's current events, Professor Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr meet a young Jean Grey at her parents' house. Ten years later, a young Warren Worthington III tries to cut off his wings, before his father discovers he is a mutant.
The next scene opens with the X-Men in battle against a giant robot in the Danger Room. Kitty Pryde and Colossus have joined the team, although Cyclops is absent. Storm insists on working as a team, but Wolverine has Colossus throw him as he cuts the giant robot's head off. Storm is upset with Logan for not working as part of a team.
Sometime afterward, the pharmaceutical company Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives mutants their abilities and makes them different from other humans, offering the ""cure"" to any mutant who wants it. While some mutants are interested in the cure, including the X-Men's Rogue, many others are horrified by the announcement. In response to the news, the X-Men's adversary, Lensherr, now known as Magneto, raises an army, warning his followers that the ""cure"" will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race.
Cyclops, still depressed about the loss of Jean, returns to Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Cyclops, but as the two romantically kiss, Jean takes on a fearsome appearance. Psychically sensing trouble, Professor X sends Wolverine and Storm to investigate. When they arrive, the two X-Men encounter telekinetically floating rocks, Cyclops' glasses, and an unconscious Jean. Cyclops himself is nowhere to be found. Xavier explains that when Jean sacrificed herself, she unleashed the powerful alternate personality she calls ""Phoenix"". Wolverine is disgusted to learn that Xavier has kept Jean in check telepathically, but when Jean awakens, he realizes she is not the Jean Grey he knew. Jean pleads with Wolverine to kill her, but when he refuses, the Phoenix surfaces and knocks out Wolverine, before escaping to her childhood home.
Magneto, alerted by Callisto to the presence of an immeasurably strong and powerful mutant, realizes that it must be Jean Grey. Magneto and his allies are already at Jean's childhood home when Xavier and his X-Men arrive. The two men vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys her family's house, disintegrates Xavier, and leaves with Magneto.
The X-Men regroup to confront Magneto's army, despite being significantly outnumbered. Magneto has diverted the Golden Gate Bridge to provide access to Alcatraz Island, the location of Worthington Labs facility. The military troops defending the facility are armed with plastic ""cure weapons"" able to neutralize the attacking mutants, and non-metallic to counter Magneto's powers. Magneto lets the lesser-powered mutants charge ahead, with heavy initial losses, but then they rapidly begin to overwhelm the troops. The X-Men Wolverine, Storm, Beast, Iceman, Colossus and Kitty Pryde arrive to battle Magneto and his troops.
During the fight, Beast injects Magneto with the cure, nullifying his powers. Meanwhile, Kitty has entered the facility to find Jimmy, who is the source of the cure and saves him from the murderous Juggernaut. They escape as Army reinforcements arrive, only to be obliterated by Phoenix, lashing out with her power and destroying everything around her including the lab itself. Wolverine realizes that due to his self-healing power, he is the only one who can approach her. He tells Storm to evacuate everyone and faces Phoenix alone, his power barely neutralizing her disintegration attack. Jean, momentarily gaining control, begs Wolverine to save her. Telling Jean he loves her, Wolverine kills her and holds her dead body as he weeps.
The school continues without Xavier, with Storm now as headmistress and Logan as a teacher. The US president appoints Beast as ambassador to the United Nations, Rogue returns, telling Iceman she has taken the cure and the two hold hands skin-to-skin.
In the epilogue, Magneto sits alone at a chessboard in a San Francisco park. He gestures forlornly towards the queen, causing it to tilt slightly.","kill me or i'll kill again.,hell hath no fury like a woman scorned,you want society to accept you,i hear you're quite an animal,powers won't work,great power,part of something much bigger,bad-ass,mutant and prou,in chess,you already know the answer,turning point, the pawns go first,juggernaut,age the beast,the real enemy is out there",1306.jpg,2006-05-23, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/x-men-the-last-stand/id278416826?uo=4,,,,"Action & Adventure,Science Fiction & Fantasy"

Yonkers Joe hustles, setting up schemes to cheat at cards and dice. He has a girlfriend, Janice, but does he care about her or just need a partner in his cons? He's working out a scam of casinos, gathering intelligence in Atlantic City. The fly in the ointment is his son, Joe Jr., a mentally-challenged young man about to turn 21, aging out of a group home, belligerent as the move to an adult home and his father's lack of contact upset him.

","Joe (Palminteri) is a small-time con-man and dice-hustler who works with a group of men with similar interests. They shave cards and dice, doing small time cons at card games and union picnics. He's in a long-term relationship with Janice (Lahti) and has a son with Down's syndrome, Joe Jr. (Guiry).
Joe finds out that his son must leave his residential care facility due to age. Joe Jr. has difficulty controlling his anger. He uses profanity and gets into fights. Thus, the residential facility is hesitant to recommend him to the group home for adults and Joe must take his son home, at least for a few weeks. Joe has been looking to make a bigger score, and he begins to hope that such a score could enable him to get his son into the group home. Sure that he could not care for his son, he begins work putting together a scam in Vegas.
During this time, the film shows that Joe's crew are affectionate towards Joe Jr., often more so than Joe himself. Joe Jr. also strikes up a friendship with Janice. When Stanley (Lerner) finds some men who will front Joe and the crew the cash, plans are laid for a trip to Vegas in the hope of scoring big. Tensions remain between Joe and Joe Jr., but they all travel to Vegas to find a way to hustle the casinos. While in Vegas, Joe Jr. gives a gift to Janice at the hotel room and then tries to force himself on her sexually. Joe comes in and pulls him off. All three are visibly shaken and Joe Jr. runs out of the hotel. At Janice's request, Joe catches up with him and brings him back. She forgives Joe Jr., but it becomes clear to her that they cannot handle him alone without professional help.
While watching someone else roll the dice in Craps, Joe realizes that the cameras focus on the shooter. Using Joe Jr. as a partner, he demonstrates to Stanley and Janice that if he only rolls one die a partner across the table could drop a second weighted die in an almost unrecognizable move. Repeat the move and two weighted dice are on the table, enabling the crew to win big. Stanley originally agrees to drop the dice, but backs out because of fear that if he's caught he could lose his business. Joe Jr. offers to drop the dice and, after much reluctance, Joe agrees.
One by one they gather at a craps table in the casino. Joe Jr. comes up, drops the dice, but is asked to leave by a casino employee watching the table. As Joe Jr. walks out the door of the casino, the crew around the table begin to win with the weighted dice. Joe narrowly avoids being caught, and the crew succeeds in their score. However, after leaving the casino, Joe Jr. fails to show up at the meeting place. After a search, Joe finds Joe Jr. at a bus stop, ready to travel back to the residential facility. Joe Jr. explains that he has spoken to the manager and apologized for his past behavior. The facility has agreed to take Joe Jr. back until the group home is ready for him in six months. Joe at first resists, but eventually gives in and tearfully says goodbye to his son.
When returns to Janice he explains that Joe Jr. has ""let him go.""",,2898.jpg,2008-1-1, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/yonkers-joe/id319440683?uo=4,,70111370,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Yonkers_Joe/70111370,Drama

","Alfie (Anthony Hopkins) and Helena (Gemma Jones) divorce. Helena begins seeing fortune teller Cristal (Pauline Collins) for spiritual advice. Their daughter Sally (Naomi Watts) has a troubled marriage with author Roy (Josh Brolin), who once wrote a successful book, and is now anxiously waiting for response from his publisher about the manuscript of his newest one. Helena helps pay their rent.
Alfie marries a prostitute, Charmaine (Lucy Punch). Roy falls for Dia (Freida Pinto), a musicologist he sees through a window near his and Sally‚Äö√Ñ√¥s flat, who is engaged to another man. Sally considers having an affair with Greg (Antonio Banderas), her new boss at an art gallery who she confesses she has feelings for but Greg confesses he is having trouble at home and eventually it turns out he is having an affair with Iris (Anna Friel), Sally's prot‚àö¬©g‚àö¬©.
Roy's book is rejected. He hears that a friend, who is also a writer, has died in an accident, and of whom only Roy knows that he had just finished a manuscript that he had not shown to anyone else yet. Roy steals it, and claims it is his work. It is well received. He convinces Dia to break off her engagement, and moves in with her.
Alfie gets into a fight and worries about Charmaine's high expenses. He asks Helena to make a new start with him, but she refuses because she feels attracted to a keeper of an occult bookshop, a widower. Charmaine has sex with another man and gets pregnant. Alfie wants a DNA test to find out whether he is the father, while Charmaine argues that it does not matter.
Sally quits her job and asks Helena for a loan she promised, for setting up her own art gallery, but Helena refuses because according to Cristal it is astrologically a bad time. Sally is furious. Roy is informed that there was a mix-up of the persons killed in the accident, and is shocked to hear that the friend whose manuscript he stole is actually in coma and recovering.
In the end, all are dissatisfied with their choices, except for Helena. She has acquired from Cristal a belief in reincarnation, and sees her life now as only one episode in her series of lives. She starts a relationship with Jonathan (Roger Ashton-Griffiths), the keeper of an occult bookshop.

Mavis Gary, once the high school 'It Girl', now an alcoholic divorc‚àö¬©e who writes a soon to be canceled young adult fiction series, makes the decision to return to her childhood home in Minnesota. There she embarks on a plan to win back her former sweetheart, Buddy. The fact that Buddy is now married with a baby doesn't dissuade her. Along the way, she forms a bond with Matt Freehauf, another former classmate, who has been left disabled by a beating he took from a bunch of jocks.

","Mavis Gary (Charlize Theron) is a divorced, 37-year-old ghost writer of a series of young adult novels, who is on deadline with her editor to finish the last book of the soon-to-be-cancelled series. Mavis receives an e-mail with a picture of the newborn daughter of her high school boyfriend Buddy Slade (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Beth (Elizabeth Reaser). Believing this to be a sign she and Buddy are meant to be together, Mavis leaves Minneapolis and returns to her hometown of Mercury, Minnesota, to reclaim her life with Buddy, under the pretext of overseeing a real estate deal.
Upon arriving after multiple listens of ""The Concept"" by Teenage Fanclub on an old mixtape Buddy gave her in high school, Mavis arranges to meet him the next day at a local sports bar, for old times' sake. In the interim, she goes alone to a different bar, Woody's. There she reconnects with a former classmate she barely remembers, Matt Freehauf (Patton Oswalt), who became partially disabled after being beaten by jocks who erroneously assumed he was gay. Matt tells Mavis that her plan to destroy Buddy's marriage is irrational and selfish, but she ignores him.
The following day, Mavis meets Buddy at the sports bar, where they run into Matt, the bar's bookkeeper. On their way out, Buddy invites Mavis to a performance of Beth's ""mom rock band"". In the interim, Mavis spends another night getting drunk with Matt, who distills homemade bourbon in the garage of the house he shares with his sister Sandra. When Mavis attends the concert of Beth's band, the other moms are resentful of Mavis, who they remember as the ""psychotic prom queen bitch"". When Beth's band performs, the lead singer dedicates their opening song to Buddy from Beth; much to Mavis's dismay, it is ""The Concept"".
Beth wants to stay out longer, so Mavis offers to drive the drunk Buddy home. On the lawn they share a kiss that is quickly broken up when the babysitter opens the front door to greet them. The next day, after an awkward encounter with her parents, Mavis is invited to Buddy's daughter's naming ceremony. She later goes out drinking with Matt again, during which Matt tells Mavis to grow up. The following day, Mavis attends the party, where she declares her love for Buddy, but he rebuffs her. Everyone at the party is called out to the lawn to await a surprise Buddy has prepared for Beth. Mavis, who has been drinking at the party, collides with Beth, who accidentally spills punch on Mavis' dress. Mavis insults her, and in a profanity-laced tirade tearfully reveals she became pregnant with Buddy's baby years ago, but had a miscarriage after three months.
Buddy, who has been preparing a drum-set gift for Beth in the garage, opens the garage door and belatedly learns what has transpired. Mavis asks him why he invited her. He reveals it was Beth's idea, as she feels sorry for Mavis. Humiliated, Mavis leaves the party and visits Matt, where she breaks down in tears and, later, initiates sex. The following morning, while Matt sleeps, Mavis has coffee in the kitchen with Sandra, who still idolizes her. Mavis talks about needing to change herself, but Sandra says Mavis is better than the rest of Mercury and should not change. Mavis says she agrees, and prepares to return to Minneapolis. Sandra asks to go with her but Mavis declines and leaves alone.
In a diner on her way home, Mavis writes the last chapter of the book, in which the main character graduates high school, quickly leaves her past behind and looks forward to the future. Afterward, in the parking lot, Mavis contemplates her crumpled car.","i hate this town,gross,psychotic,psychotic prom queen bitch,chipotle,mini apple,prom queen,loving women,married man,fish shit,small dog,mini,a hick,kentucky fried chicken,cynical,high school,sincere,therapist,doughy,kentacohut,single mother,i'm crazy,the graduate,fag,no one loves me,piece of shit,mercury,bitch,in order to heal a few people have to get hurt,piece of work,love conquers all,mavis gary",124.jpg,2011-12-09, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/young-adult/id507729345?uo=4,IyoXvXPy3Ig,70173046,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Young_Adult/70173046,"Comedy,Drama"

Documents the true story of the final weeks of rehearsal for the Young at Heart Chorus in Northampton, MA, whose average age is 81, and many of whom must overcome health adversities to participate. Their music is unexpected, going against the stereotype of their age group, performing songs, for example, by James Brown, and Sonic Youth.

3246,Your Friend the Rat,An animated tongue-in-cheek documentary presented by Remy and Emile to state their case as to why humans and rats should just get along. Remy starts off as our guide through the history man and rat have shared. Emile then provides us with a lot of fun rat facts to help the viewer better appreciate the rat. The two pull out all the stops and end with a song describing a rat and human utopia.,"The short starts in with Remy introducing himself and Emile to the audience and speaking on behalf of oppressed rats everywhere. Emile starts frowning about having to speak out, while Remy pulls a scroll and a two-dimensional animation starts by presenting the relation between a human and a rat in contrast with human-dog and human-cat relationships. Remy points out that humans regarded rats in former times as sacred and luck bringing. He says that during the Roman Empire if a white rat crosses your path, it brought good luck, while if a black rat crosses your path, it brought bad luck. He moves on to discussing black rats (Rattus rattus) and their connection to the Black Death, pointing out that it was caused by fleas not rats, resulting in the death of one third of Europe's population.
Remy further presents the brown rat's (Rattus norvegicus) history, mentioning their part in ending the Black Death, their honorable position in the Chinese zodiac and their sacredness in India for being the transport vehicle of the Hindu god Ganesh. The symbiotic relationship between rats and humans is introduced before the second appearance of Remy and Emile in 3D animation. Emile pulls a scroll from the side and presents through 2D animation the benefits of rats for the human. He says that Jack Black was a rat catcher for Queen Victoria and that he kept the rats he captured as pets. Their use for laboratory testing and as pets show that they can have a good relationship with humans. Concluding the presentation Emile and Remy sing a song about the relationship between rats and humans. At the film's end, a long and drawn-out (mostly satirical) disclaimer is shown asking children to stay away from rats, while Remy and Emile stand in front of it and try to remove it, urging the audience to ignore the warning and complaining about freedom of speech and lack of food, respectively.",,3246.jpg,2007-11-06, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/your-friend-the-rat/id299555824?uo=4,,,,"Animation,Kids & Family,Special Interest"

 Mark Duplass, Emily Blunt, Rosemarie DeWitt","Jack, emotionally struggling a year after the death of his brother, takes up an offer from his friend (and his brother's ex girlfriend) Iris to stay at her father's isolated cabin. Once he arrives there by bicycle, Jack unexpectedly encounters Iris's sister Hannah, a lesbian who has recently broken up with her partner and has moved to the cabin without letting her family know. Although she initially attempts to attack him as a trespasser, he explains his relationship to Iris and she allows him to stay.
Later that night, he has trouble sleeping in his small bed and wanders to the kitchen to find Hannah drinking heavily alone. The pair drink together and strike up a conversation about their relationships, which progressively grows more personal until they find themselves eager for sex. With a condom supplied by Hannah, they have brief sex.
Unexpectedly, Iris suddenly arrives at the cabin the next morning. After they exchange greetings and explanations, Jack privately pleads with Hannah not mention their tryst to Iris. While at first incredulously bemused, when Iris divulges to her sister her having fallen in love with Jack, Hannah agrees with Jack that she will keep their indiscretion secret.
Later in the day, the trio strike up a friendly conversation leading to the reason behind Hannah's breakup: her desire to have a child. At that, Iris comments that Hannah could simply get a male donor to be pregnant. When Hannah and Iris decide to go for a stroll, Jack tells them he'd rather stay at the cabin ""to read."" During their stroll, a guilt-ridden Hannah confesses to Iris she slept with Jack, while a suspicious Jack examines the trashed condom, discovering it heavily perforated.
Jack confronts Hannah in front of Iris and she confesses that she deliberately sabotaged the condom in hopes of becoming impregnated someday. At this, Jack accuses Hannah of ""stealing my sperm"" and abruptly departs, leaving the sisters alone to sort out this transgression. Over time, the sisters gradually reconcile, with Iris offering her help should Hannah give birth; meanwhile, Jack's bike breaks down in a nearby town, leading him to vent his frustrations by destroying it.
Eventually, Jack returns to the cabin and requites Iris's love, also offering to help Hannah to take care of her possible baby. Hannah agrees and the trio attempt to work as a team. The film ends with Hannah taking a home pregnancy test with Iris and Jack joining her to see the result.","one night stand,secluded cabin,condom sex,vegan,death of brother,sister sister relationship,condom,suspected pregnancy,romantic situation,repetition in title,bicycle,lesbian,family relationships,responsibility",7263.jpg,2012-06-29,,C6NJzrA4oHs,,,"Drama,Comedy"

","The film opens in 1938, introducing Dominic Matei (Tim Roth), a 70-year old professor of linguistics. On the eve of World War II, Dominic attempts to visit the Caf‚àö¬© Select but is denied access due to wearing his pyjamas. Dominic realises that he is getting no younger, and has essentially failed his aim in life ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ to fully discover the origin of human language. His tireless labours have condemned him to a solitary existence, often spent pining after Laura (Alexandra Maria Lara), the love of his youth. Intent on committing suicide, Dominic travels to Bucharest, the city where he and Laura met at university. He is struck by lightning. In hospital, he is initially diagnosed by Professor Stanciulescu (Bruno Ganz) to be dying of his burns. However, Stanciulescu is startled when his patient regenerates into a much younger man. The Professor helps Dominic out of the hospital so as to continue studying him. Shortly afterwards, Romania is occupied by the Nazis, whose interests are aroused by Stanciulescu‚Äö√Ñ√¥s miracle patient.
While residing at the Professor's home, Dominic realises that he possesses strange capacities. He begins to experience multiple planes of reality, blurring his perception of whether he is awake or asleep. He mistakes the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Woman in Room Six‚Äö√Ñ√π (Alexandra Pirici) for an erotic fantasy ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ when in reality, she is a Nazi spy. During his nights together with the Woman, Dominic discovers he has an unnatural talent for languages after they communicate effortlessly in French, German, and even Sanskrit. As his abilities progress, Dominic becomes aware of an ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π self who speaks to him in mirrors and dreams. This alternate persona serves as the voice of his condition, claiming to exist outside of space and time. When Dominic asks for proof, the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π obliges by bringing him two roses which materialise out of nowhere. Unbeknownst to Dominic, Stanciulescu has witnessed the event and overhears his friend ask himself ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Where do you want me to place the third rose?‚Äö√Ñ√π. This gives the Professor great concern and understanding for the Nazis‚Äö√Ñ√¥ designs upon Dominic. A Third Reich programme led by Doktor Josef Rudolf (Andr‚àö¬© Hennicke) has recently confiscated his research and is unsuccessfully attempting to duplicate the lightning. Stanciulescu persuades Dominic to escape from Romania, aided by anti-Nazi sympathisers. While on the run, Dominic discovers he now possesses the knowledge to forge passports and conceal his identity. Thanks to the Nazi confiscation of research, Dominic‚Äö√Ñ√¥s existence has essentially been erased from the records. Later, he is saddened to learn that the Professor has died in a plane crash.
Living like a spy, Dominic eventually arrives in Switzerland. Unfortunately, the Woman in Room Six has managed to pick up his trace, leading to a confrontation between Dominic and Doktor Rudolf in an alleyway. The doctor argues that Dominic‚Äö√Ñ√¥s existence supports the Nazis‚Äö√Ñ√¥ ideal of the superman, and that the coming nuclear warfare can only be survived by a superior species of man. In the background, the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π Dominic confirms this to be the case. However, Dominic himself refuses to cooperate, forcing the doctor to pull a gun on him. The Woman is shot defending Dominic, provoking him to telekinetically manipulate Rudolf into shooting himself. The war ends but Rudolf‚Äö√Ñ√¥s fears about nuclear armament are realized. Dominic resumes a normal existence, during which he continues his research. Realising that he has been transformed into a human of the future ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ thus gifting him with knowledge of the fate of mankind ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ he develops a secret language for his audio diary, to be deciphered by a supercomputer in the year 2010 ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ long after the nuclear apocalypse.
Many years later, Dominic encounters a girl named Veronica (Alexandra Maria Lara) while hiking in the Alps. The ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π reveals her to be the reincarnation of Laura. When the mountains are hit by a violent storm, Dominic rushes to her rescue. He finds her huddled in a cave, chanting in Sanskrit, which he greets her with to gain her trust. During her stay in hospital, Dominic finds that Veronica now identifies herself as ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Rupini‚Äö√Ñ√π, the daughter of a wealthy family in India who were among the first disciples of the Buddha. While the doctors assume she is suffering from amnesia and delusion from the incident, he suspects that she may now be suffering from a condition similar to his own and calls the Roman College of Oriental Studies for aid. Led by Professor Giuseppe Tucci (Marcel Iures), the scholars confirm that Rupini was a real person, who went to a cave many centuries ago to meditate on Enlightenment. Since the cave‚Äö√Ñ√¥s location is unknown, the scholars agree to fund an expedition to find the cave in India, hoping that Veronica‚Äö√Ñ√¥s past self will guide them. Dominic volunteers to accompany them under the alias ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Martin Audricourt‚Äö√Ñ√π. The venture proves a success when a local holy man recognises ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Rupini‚Äö√Ñ√π and directs her to the place of meditation. While investigating the cave, Dominic finds the bones of the original Rupini. After this discovery, Veronica becomes herself again and no longer speaks Sanskrit. Some time passes and she begins to fall for Dominic.
The couple elopes to Malta, where they live happily together ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ until Dominic tells a sleeping Veronica that he has always loved her. This causes Veronica to writhe on the bed as if possessed and begin chanting in a language even he does not understand. The ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π appears to him and explains that she is speaking in ancient Egyptian, having travelled further back along the path of her past selves. Over the next two weeks, Dominic and the ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π learn how to control this state in Veronica, leading her to regress even further back in time and speak languages such as Babylonian and previously unknown tongues. However, Veronica's health begins to decline from exhaustion, and Dominic declares that he cannot continue these sessions ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ or even being close to Veronica, since his proximity is accelerating her age. The ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π disagrees and urges him to find the Ur-Language, which would complete his life's work. Dominic tearfully explains everything to Veronica and leaves her weeping, begging for him to stay. In 1969, Veronica departs from a train with two children in France. Without being noticed, Dominic takes a snapshot of her and begins to cry when she passes without recognizing him. Despairing, he returns to the town where he taught as a professor. His alter ego appears to him and reveals the truth about the future ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ nuclear warfare will unleash an electromagnetic pulse, giving birth to a new and more powerful human species, of which Dominic is but the first member. Veronica symbolised the dawn of man, and he stood for the dusk. Dominic is outraged at the idea of sacrificing millions of lives in the name of evolution and shatters the mirror. The ‚Äö√Ñ√∫other‚Äö√Ñ√π is completely taken off guard and slowly vanishes, all the while yelling in an unknown language.
The film comes full circle when Dominic returns to the Caf‚àö¬© Select to clear his thoughts. While there, he encounters all of his old colleagues, who are long dead. As more friends from his past join him and offer warm greetings, Dominic becomes more agitated and begins to age, complaining that this is a dream of a dream of a dream. He mumbles that should he ever solve the ""worry that we all share,"" he will tell them the answer. Dominic stumbles out of the room and journeys back into the snowy winter night. In the morning, townsfolk find his aged body, lying dead at the bottom of a staircase. They search his passport, but find only the younger alias of ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Martin Audricourt‚Äö√Ñ√π.
In the final scene, Veronica‚Äö√Ñ√¥s voice is heard echoing ‚Äö√Ñ√∫Where do you want me to put the third rose?‚Äö√Ñ√π ‚Äö√Ñ√¨ the rose appears in Dominic‚Äö√Ñ√¥s lifeless grasp.","photo album,rapid aging,freeze to death,exhaustion,world war two,roses,india,glamour,smoking,memory,taxi,false passport,professor,tape recorder,struck by lightning,passion,upside down image,doctor,sex,life magazine,train,hospital,despair,secret,smoke,romania,zurich switzerland,frozen body,lightning strike,miracle,lightning,mein kampf,maid,fear,berne switzerland,swastika,nazi,gunshot,flashback,linguistics,nostalgia,youth,doppelganger,train station,casino,newspaper story,cave,malta,melancholy,sanskrit,1950s,recovery,bucharest romania,metaphysics",3699.jpg,2007-10-26, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/youth-without-youth/id519407204?uo=4,,70077547,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Youth_Without_Youth/70077547,"Drama,Mystery & Suspense,Romance"

","Zack Brown and Miri Linky are roommates in Monroeville, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb). They have been friends since the first grade. Despite Miri working at the local shopping mall and Zack working at a coffee shop, they have not paid their utility bills in months, with Zack devoting much of his free time to a fanatic following of the Pittsburgh Penguins and his status in the community amateur hockey team, the Monroeville Zombies. After work, their water gets turned off before they go to their high school reunion.
At the reunion, Miri attempts to seduce her attractive former classmate Bobby Long, while Zack strikes up a conversation with Brandon St. Randy, who reveals that he is a gay porn star, and Bobby's boyfriend. After returning home from the reunion, the apartment's electricity is turned off. Inspired by a successful viral video that was filmed by a pair of teenage boys as Miri changed in Zack's place of work for the reunion (revealing that she wore unattractive underwear, ""granny panties""), and emboldened by the cultural mainstreaming of pornographic entertainment, Zack convinces Miri that they should film a pornographic film to earn money.
Gathering a group of acquaintances and hired help as the cast and crew, they decide to film a pornographic Star Wars parody, entitled Star Whores. Delaney, the film's producer and Zack's co-worker, rents film equipment and a building to use as a studio. When they return to the studio after the first night of filming, the building is being demolished, with all the equipment and costumes inside. They are told that the man that rented it to them had run off with the money. Later at the coffee shop where Zack works, he realizes that his boss threatened to install a hidden camera, which Zack finds, and decides to use it to replace their lost film equipment. Zack retools his film to take place in the coffee shop, revamping the film to one with a coffee shop motif, Swallow My Cockuccino, and the group shoots the film after hours.
Despite their insistence that they would not let sex with each other affect their friendship, Zack and Miri soon develop romantic feelings for each other. When it comes time for Zack and Miri to have sex on camera, they find that instead of the clinical sex enacted by the actors in the other scenes, their interlude is romantic and heartfelt. Later that evening, Zack and Miri are at home when suddenly their apartment's electricity and water service return. The rest of the actors and crew show up and reveal that they pooled their resources to pay one month of their bills, and have come over to throw them a party.
At the party, one of the other actresses, Stacey, asks Miri if it is okay for her to ask Zack to have sex. Although Miri has realized that she has developed feelings for Zack, she tells her it is okay to ask him. When Stacey relates this to Zack, the two retreat to Zack's bedroom, much to Miri's dismay.
The next evening, Zack is preparing to film a scene between Stacey and another actor, Lester, that was supposed to have been with Lester and Miri. Zack is dismayed when Miri shows up and insists on shooting the scene as originally planned. In the back room, an incredulous Zack asks if she is doing this as a form of retaliation, pointing out that Stacey told him that Miri did not mind her sleeping with Zack. Miri corrects him, clarifying that she did not mind that Stacey merely made the offer to sleep with him. Perceiving this to have been some type of test, Zack admits that during the sex scene they filmed together, they were actually making love and that there was an emotional connection between them, and that he loves Miri. When Miri does not reciprocate, Zack storms out of the coffee shop, quitting the film and his job, and moves out of the apartment.
Three months later, Delaney goes to see Zack, who has moved on to an exterior concessions job at Mellon Arena during Pittsburgh Penguins games. Delaney convinces him to come to Delaney's home to see the unfinished film and help complete it. Zack agrees, and as Delaney and the cameraman Deacon explain, Zack learns that Miri never filmed her sex scene with Lester. Zack goes to Miri's apartment and reveals to her that he never slept with Stacey; instead, they talked about Miri all night. He pours his heart out to Miri, proclaiming his love for her, which she reciprocates.
In the epilogue, the audience learns that Zack and Miri are married, and with the help of Delaney and his worker's compensation settlement, they start their own video production company, Zack and Miri Make Your Porno, which makes amateur videos for couples.","dildo,panties,amateur,faking it,cock,fucking,dutch rudder,molester,swallow,mothafuckas,star whores,anticipation,pussy,cockenschtuff,fake orgasm,pornography,rubber,no panties,sex on camera,slut,cunt,penis,orgasms,porn,sex toy,breasts,ebony and ivory,fluff,whack it,surprise,clitoris,videotaped sex,sex,do you like pussy,joy,fuckback mountain,porn star,fuck you,macguyver,popsicle,dick,gayness,meaty,fuck,porno,upskirt,amateur pornography,pecker,bejeesus,cockaccino,sex in store,shut your mouth,pervert,leg spreading",2304.jpg,2008-09-07, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/zack-and-miri-make-a-porno/id304927665?uo=4,,70099118,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Zack_and_Miri_Make_a_Porno/70099118,"Comedy,Drama,Romance"

This subject matter will transcend the issues of cultural relativism and traditional ideology and move to relate the core, empirical ""life ground"" attributes of human and social survival, extrapolating those immutable natural laws into a new sustainable social paradigm called a ""Resource-Based Economy"".

","Part I: Human Nature
The film begins with a brief animated sequence narrated by Jacque Fresco. He describes his adolescent life and his discontinuation of public education at the age of 14 to study under his own will. He continues to express that his radical views developed as a result of experiences during the Great Depression and World War II. Studying the social sciences, mechanical and social engineering, architecture among numerous other fields of study for 75 years have, Fresco states, failed to alter this initial, radical, disposition, which he continues to outline in greater detail later in the film.
The discussion turns to human behavior and the nature vs. nurture debate. This portion begins with a small clip with Robert Sapolsky summing up the nature vs. nurture debate in which he essentially refers to it as a ""false dichotomy."" After which he states that ""it is virtually impossible to understand how biology works, outside the context of environment."" During which time the film then goes onto describe that it is neither Nature nor Nurture that solely shapes human behavior, but the combination of both. The interviewed pundits state that even with genetic predispositions to diseases, the expression and manifestation of disease is largely determined by environmental stressors, including topics such as epigenetics and Gene‚Äö√Ñ√¨environment interactions. Disease, criminal activity and addictions are also placed in the same light. One study discussed showed that newly born babies are more likely to die if they are not touched. Another study which was mentioned claimed to show how stressed women were more likely to have children with addiction disorders.[citation needed] A reference is made to the unborn children who were in utero during the Dutch famine of 1944. The ""Dutch Famine Birth Cohort Study"" is mentioned to have shown that obesity and other health complications became common problems later in life, due to prolonged starvation of their mother during pregnancy.[3] Comparisons are made by sociologists of criminals in different parts of the world and how different cultures with different values can often have more peaceful inhabitants. An Anabaptist sect called the Hutterites are mentioned to have never reported a homicide in any of their societies. The overall conclusion of Part I is that social environment and cultural conditioning play a large part in shaping human behavior.
[edit]Part II: Social Pathology
The origins of our modern economic paradigm are explored, beginning with John Locke and Adam Smith. In Two Treatises of Government, John Locke lays out the fundamental principles of private ownership of land, labor and capital. In The Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith mentions the invisible hand balancing out supply and demand leading to trade equilibrium.[4] The argument becomes religious as the invisible hand is interpreted as the hand of God. A critical view of economic theory is made by questioning the need for private property, money and the inherent inequality between agents in the system. Also seen critically is the need for cyclical consumption in order to maintain market share which results in wasted resources. Planned obsolescence is shown to be another important side-effect of the market system, where goods are deliberately made defective or not having sufficient technology in order to maintain a large turnover rate. The economic paradigm is then termed anti-economy due to these profligate activities. The above described process of individuals and groups exchanging goods, labor and capital is mentioned as the market economy.
The other component is the monetary economy. The monetary system regulates the money supply and interest rates by buying/selling treasuries. More critical views of the monetary system are explained. According to Zeitgeist, in the final analysis the current monetary system can only result in default or hyperinflation. This is because when money comes into existence it is created by loans at interest. The existing money supply is only the principal. The interest to pay the loan that created the money does not exist in the money supply and must be borrowed repetitively in order to service the debt. Due to this exponential money supply growth, Zeitgeist predicts the value of money is eventually destroyed as evidenced by the 96% devaluation of the U.S. money supply since the Federal Reserve was chartered in 1914 and 80% devaluation since the U.S. ended the Bretton Woods agreement in 1971.[5][6]
[edit]Part III: Project Earth
As with Zeitgeist: Addendum, to improve the human condition the film presents a ""resource-based economy"" as advocated by Jacque Fresco. The dialogue leads to a train of thought on how human civilization should start from the beginning. Imagine an exact copy of Earth somewhere in space: conduct a survey of the planet, to assess the resource types, locations, quantities, to satisfy human demands; track the consumption and depletion of resources to regulate human demands and maintain the condition of the environment; localize the distribution of resources, to control environmental impacts and maintain self-sufficiency; place an emphasis on recycling and the use of public transportation, in order to avoid resource waste. Through the global application of existing revolutionary technologies in the manufacturing and distribution sectors, labor and money will eventually become obsolete; thereby establishing the foundation of a resource-based economy. Various technologies for improving civilization under the resource-based economy are described. The city structure will consist of concentric rings, every ring serving one critical function necessary for the function of a self-sufficient city: agriculture, energy production, residents, hospitals, schools, etc. For agriculture, hydroponics and aeroponics are mentioned as a possible solutions for food shortages. Maglev trains provide transport for the city residents. Manufacturing and construction become automated with mechanized technologies, such as three-dimensional printing and computer-aided manufacturing. Mentioned energy production methods: photovoltaic paint, wind turbines, pressure transducers and geothermal power plants.
[edit]Part IV: Rise
The world state of affairs is described in a dire light. The peak oil phenomenon is seen as a threat to civilization‚Äö√Ñ√¥s progress, potentially resulting in extinction. A case is presented that pollution, deforestation, climate change, overpopulation, and warfare are all created and perpetuated by the socioeconomic system. Various poverty statistics are shown that suggest a progressive worsening of world culture. According to the United Nations, currently 18,000 children a day die from starvation.[7] Also according to the UN, global poverty rates have doubled since the 1970s.[8]
The movie closes with a standoff between protesters on the streets of Times Square in New York City facing off against police in riot gear while in the midst of global economic depression. People withdraw trillions of dollars from the world‚Äö√Ñ√¥s central banks, then dump the money at the doors of the banks. The police stand down. The final scene of the film shows a partial view of earth from space, followed by a sequence of superimposed statements; ""This is your world"", ""This is our world"", and ""The revolution is now"".","propagandists,well being,change,incentive,wasted resources,automation,socioeconomics,thought provoking,stylized,systems theory,efficiency,propaganda film,disturbing,economics,martin luther king jr,capitalism,materialism,impoverishment,maladjusted,propaganda,values,resource management,shackles,stress,sustainability,consumerism,freedow,system,borrowed,hand tied,market economy,egalitariansm,tied,play the game,nature versus nurture,culture,monetary system,decay,technology,resources,environment,society,life experience,politics,ernst fischer,mindless consumption,genetics,public health,behavioural violence,monetary system,usury,system,utopian,decaying culture,money,society,economists,strategy,hands tied,advertising,epigenetics,conditioning,energy,poverty,debt,determinism,exploitation,clever,biology",38.jpg,2011-01-15, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/zeitgeist-moving-forward/id518411728?uo=4,QYLLFpNn4lM,70225009,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Zeitgeist_Moving_Forward/70225009,"Documentary,Special Interest"
7202,Zero Dark Thirty,"A chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.
Maya is a CIA operative whose first experience is in the interrogation of prisoners following the Al Qaeda attacks against the U.S. on the 11th September 2001. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics. For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden. But only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.

","In 2003, Maya, a young CIA officer, has spent her entire brief career, since she graduated from university, focusing solely on intelligence related to Osama bin Laden, leader of al-Qaeda, following the terrorist organization's September 11 attacks in the United States. She has just been reassigned to the U.S. embassy in Pakistan to work with a fellow officer, Dan. During the first months of her assignment, Maya often accompanies Dan to a black site for his continuing interrogation of Ammar, a detainee with suspected links to several Saudi terrorists. Dan subjects the detainee to torture, including waterboarding, and humiliation. He and Maya eventually trick Ammar into divulging that an old acquaintance, who is using the alias 'Abu Ahmed', is working as a personal courier for bin Laden. Other detainees corroborate this, with some claiming Abu Ahmed delivers messages between bin Laden and a man referred to as Abu Faraj. In mid-2005, Abu Faraj is apprehended by the CIA and local police in Pakistan. Maya interrogates Abu Faraj under torture, but he continues to deny knowing a courier with such a name. Maya interprets this as Abu Faraj's trying to conceal the importance of Abu Ahmed.
Maya continues to sift through masses of data and information, using a variety of technology, hunches and sharing insights. Displaying the zeal and frustrations of a 'single-tasker', she concentrates on finding Abu Ahmed, determined to use him to find bin Laden. During a span of five years, she survives the 2008 Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing as well as being shot at in her car by armed men. Dan, departing on re-assignment, warns Maya about a possible change in politics, suggesting that the new administration may prosecute those officers who had been involved in torture. Maya's fellow officer and friend Jessica is killed in the 2009 Camp Chapman attack. A Jordanian detainee claims the man previously identified as Abu Ahmed, from a photograph, is a man he personally buried in 2001. Several CIA officers ‚ Maya's seniors, conclude the target who could be Abu Ahmed is long dead, and that they have searched a false trail for nine years.
A fellow analyst researching Moroccan intelligence archives comes to Maya and suggests that Abu Ahmed is 'Ibrahim Sayeed'. Maya agrees and contacts Dan, who is working at the CIA headquarters. Maya has found that Ibrahim Sayeed had a brother, Habib, and theorizes the CIA's supposed photograph of Abu Ahmed was of Habib. He bore a striking resemblance to Ibrahim and was killed in Afghanistan.
Dan uses CIA funds to purchase a Lamborghini for a Kuwaiti prince in exchange for the telephone number of Sayeed's mother. The CIA traces calls to the mother, and one caller's persistent use of tradecraft to avoid detection leads Maya to conclude the caller is Abu Ahmed. (Computer-aided voice recognition analysis is shown, among the many technologies.) At Maya's behest and with the support of her supervisors, numerous CIA operatives are deployed to search for and identify Abu Ahmed; they locate him in his vehicle and eventually track him to a large urban compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, near the national military academy.
The CIA puts the compound under heavy surveillance for several months, using a variety of methods, but cannot prove bin Laden is there. Meanwhile, the President's National Security Advisor tasks the CIA with producing a plan to capture or kill bin Laden if it can be confirmed that he is in the compound. An agency team devises a plan to use two top-secret stealth helicopters (developed at Area 51) flown by the Army's 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to secretly enter Pakistan and insert a U.S. Navy SEAL team to raid the compound. Before briefing the President of the United States, the CIA Director holds a meeting of his top officials, who assess only a 60-80% chance that bin Laden is living in the compound, rather than another high-value target. (Maya, also in attendance, asserts the chances are 100%.)
The raid is approved and is executed on May 2, 2011. Although execution is complicated by one of the helicopters crashing (and rousing the neighborhood), the SEALs kill a number of people within the compound, among them a man on the compound's top floor who is revealed (though never fully seen) to be bin Laden. They bring bin Laden's body back to a U.S. base in Jalalabad, Afghanistan, where Maya and other CIA and military officers wait. She visually confirms the identity of the corpse. Maya is last seen boarding a military transport to return to the US and sitting in its vast interior as its only passenger. The pilot asks her where she wants to go but she doesn't reply and instead begins to weep quietly.

Among his quirks is that he never meets or has direct contact with his clients, instead conducting business through his assistant, lawyer Steve Arlo (Ben Stiller). He also subsists on cans of tuna fish. Through the movie, Zero provides narration as he reads lines from his proposed autobiography.
Zero and Arlo are hired by Portland area millionaire Gregory Stark (Ryan O'Neal). Stark has lost the key to a safety deposit box and is being blackmailed by an unknown person who forces him to go through elaborate instructions to reach a drop off point. Zero quickly discovers that the blackmailer is Gloria Sullivan (Kim Dickens) an EMT with a mysterious past. Zero refuses to turn over Gloria's identity to Stark until he understands why she is blackmailing him. Making contact with Gloria, Zero discovers that he is attracted to her, compromising his trademark objectivity.
Meanwhile Stark pressures Arlo to reveal the blackmailer's identity so that he can have that person killed. Arlo must also deal with Zero's quirky and unusual demands on his time, demands that increasingly conflict with Arlo's desire for a relationship with his girlfriend Jess.
Zero eventually discovers that Stark had been obsessed with Gloria's mother when the two were in college. She threatened to reveal that Stark had raped her and so he had her killed. However, she had already given birth to their daughter Gloria, who was discovered and raised by the hitman after the murder. At a final meeting to deliver a ransom payment, Stark collapses from a heart attack and is saved by Gloria. She then flees the country.","tax return,illegitimate daughter,liar,corpse,emissary,recluse,hitman,death of parents,husband kills wife,hired killer,loyalty,revelation,fake beard,los angeles california,health club,funeral,coincidence,murder for hire,revenge,planetarium,research,disguise,memoir,investigation,pager,confession,architect,cynical,security system,blackmail,stalking,private detective,death threat,working out,fire alarm,bag of money,awkwardness,tape recording,rape,societal dysfunction,neo noir,scrabble,desperation,penthouse,witty,treadmill,safe deposit box,port a potty,surprise ending,guitar playing,fake identity,tycoon,arrest record,client,murder,portland oregon,sky diving,poem,private investigator,eccentric,sincere,fake moustache,paranoia,humorous,smooth talker,socially awkward,surveillance camera,secrecy,silencer,airport,safe deposit box key,suspenseful,deception,freeze frame,paramedic,amphetamine,rain",424.jpg,1998-01-30, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/zero-effect/id272692548?uo=4,,8177288,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Zero_Effect/8177288,"Art House & International,Comedy,Drama,Mystery & Suspense"
2083,Zodiac,"A San Francisco cartoonist becomes an amateur detective obsessed with tracking down the Zodiac killer. A serial killer in the San Francisco Bay Area taunts police with his letters and cryptic messages. We follow the investigators and reporters in this lightly fictionalized account of the true 1970's case as they search for the murderer, becoming obsessed with the case. Based on Robert Graysmith's book, the movie's focus is the lives and careers of the detectives and newspaper people.

The true story behind the murders that many crime scholars believe to be the most perplexing series of unsolved crimes in modern history comes to the screen in chilling detail as Fight Club and Seven director David Fincher steps behind the camera to tell the mysterious tale of the infamous Zodiac killer. A relentless serial killer is stalking the streets of the San Francisco Bay Area, leaving citizens locked into a constant state of panic and baffled authorities scrambling for clues. Though the killer sadistically mocks the detectives by leaving a series of perplexing ciphers and menacing letters at the crime scenes, the investigation quickly flat-lines when none of the evidence yields any solid leads. As two detectives remain steadfast in their devotion to bringing the elusive killer to justice, they soon find that the madman has control not only over their careers, but their very lives as well.

","The film opens on July 4, 1969, with the Zodiac killer‚Äö√Ñ√¥s second attack, the shooting of Darlene Ferrin (Ciara Hughes) and Mike Mageau (Lee Norris) at a lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. Mageau survives while Ferrin dies from her injuries.
One month later, a letter written by the Zodiac arrives at the San Francisco Chronicle. Paul Avery (Robert Downey, Jr.) is a Chronicle crime reporter. Robert Graysmith (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a political cartoonist there. The newspaper receives encrypted letters that the killer sends, taunting the police. Because of Graysmith's status as a cartoonist, he is not taken seriously by Avery and the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings despite his interest in the case. In particular, he is drawn to the encrypted code that is included with the letters and is given access to one. When he is able to crack one of the codes and makes several correct guesses about the killer's actions, Avery begins sharing information with him. While at a bar together drinking Aqua Velvas, which Avery initially makes fun of Graysmith for, they discuss the coded letters.
The Zodiac killer attacks again, stabbing Bryan Hartnell (Patrick Scott Lewis) and Cecelia Shepard (Pell James) at Lake Berryessa in Napa County. Shepard dies as a result of the attack, while Hartnell survives. Soon afterward, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's Presidio Heights district. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi (Mark Ruffalo) and his partner Bill Armstrong (Anthony Edwards) are assigned to the case, liaising with other detectives such as Jack Mulanax (Elias Koteas) in Vallejo and Ken Narlow (Donal Logue) in Napa. The killer, or someone posing as him, continues to toy with authorities by speaking on the phone with celebrity lawyer Melvin Belli (Brian Cox) when he makes an appearance on a television talk show. Avery and Graysmith form an alliance, delving deeper into the case.
In 1971, Toschi, Armstrong and Mulanax question Arthur Leigh Allen (John Carroll Lynch), a potential suspect in the case. However, a handwriting expert (Philip Baker Hall) insists that Allen did not write the Zodiac letters. Avery receives a new letter threatening his life. He becomes increasingly paranoid and turns to drugs and alcohol. At one point, he shares information with a rival police force, angering Toschi and Armstrong.
By 1975, Avery leaves the Chronicle. Armstrong quits the homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith, meanwhile, continues his own in-depth investigation, interviewing witnesses and police detectives involved in the case. Obsessing over the unsolved case, he begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing (on the night of Ferrin's death, Graysmith discovered that someone prank-called the victim's family and did the same thing). Because of his submersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie (Chlo‚àö¬¥ Sevigny) leaves him, taking their children with her.
Graysmith persistently contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the information he discovered over the years, he provides contacts of other police departments in counties where the other murders occurred. The cartoonist acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the hard evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, exonerate him.
In December 1983, a full 14 years after the original slayings, Graysmith tracks Allen down to a Vallejo hardware store, where he is employed as a sales clerk. After Allen asks if he can help Graysmith with anything, they stare at each other for a moment with blank expressions, during which time Allen's name tag can be seen with ""Lee"" written on it, before Graysmith simply replies with a ""No"", and leaves the hardware store.
Eight years later, in 1991, Mageau (Jimmi Simpson) meets with authorities and identifies Allen from a police mugshot. Shortly before, as the authorities walk by a bookshelf, copies of Robert Graysmith's book Zodiac is spotted in the shelf for bestsellers.
Final title cards, however, inform the audience that Allen died in 1992 before he could be questioned further by police, and that DNA tests performed in 2002 did not match samples gathered from the Zodiac letters."," save us all,minty,stylized,aries,capricorn,bleak,zodiac,the lion,aquarius,the bull,anticipation,scary,the crab,scorpio,leo,astrology,libra,code,rough,boy scout,shorty,the twins,the maiden,the water-bearer,stars,killer,gemini,mcqueen,disgust,pisces,the fish,taurus,the scales,toschi,serial killer,sagittarius,the scorpion,the goat,tense,virgo,fuckered,eagle scout,cancer,methinks,throw your baby,the ram,contemplative,the archer,vallejo,god,bullitt,psycho,fear",2083.jpg,2007-03-02, http://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/zodiac/id268162808?uo=4,dJ0oNfjzx4k,70044686,http://www.netflix.com/Movie/Zodiac/70044686,Mystery & Suspense
7228,jOBS,"The story of Steve Jobs' ascension from college dropout into one of the most revered creative entrepreneurs of the 20th century. Ashton Kutcher stars as the legendary inventor and entrepreneur who converted a generation of computer users to Apple products.

Director: Joshua Michael Stern
Writer: Matt Whiteley
Stars: Ashton Kutcher, Josh Gad, Annika Bertea",",Oscar,Oscar 2013,Oscar nominee

Selecting a biography's starting point is always a critical decision for both content and pacing, and debuting screenwriter Matt Whiteley identifies Jobs  (Ashton Kutcher) early-'70s Reed College education -- cut short when he drops out shortly after enrolling -- as the first critical juncture in his later career. Art classes, meditation, LSD trips and travel to India all contribute to Jobs brief higher-education experience, leading to a job with pioneering video game manufacturer Atari in Silicon Valley.
Jobs and self-taught computer engineer Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad) co-found Apple Computer to manufacture the Apple I computer kit in the former's parents Los Altos garage. They soon follow up with the Apple II, one of the first consumer-market personal computers to include a video display, released in 1977 with funding from entrepreneur and former Intel engineer Mike Markkula (Dermot Mulroney).
Jobs focuses on advancing the platform, eventually launching the Macintosh computer in 1984 after having taken the company public four years earlier at the incredibly reasonable IPO price of $22 a share. The offering makes Jobs and Wozniak instant multi-millionaires, though it cuts into some of Apple’s key original employees.
An internal feud with CEO John Scully (Matthew Modine) sparks Job's departure from Apple in 1985 and the start-up of the computer hardware and software manufacturer NeXT. By then, Wozniak also had left Apple. As the company falters with various unsuccessful research and manufacturing projects in the late-'80s, Apple brings Jobs back as an adviser and eventually makes him CEO.
Stern wraps up the movie at this climactic point, with Jobs again directly associated with the brand he established and on the cusp of introducing the line of computers, communications devices and entertainment products now so familiar to consumers.
